Question No. 52 asks whether the prospective donor has in the past five years taken medication to prevent HIV infection, that is PrEP or PEP.  We queried the inclusion of that new question and the response from the Minister states that the persons who have taken medication to prevent HIV, that is PrEP, are deferred for a five-year period.  That struck us as remarkable given that this is preventive medication.<\/p> <p>I am sure many people will have seen last night's \"Prime Time\" programme which is timely to this discussion.  PrEP is the use of antiretroviral medication which prevents HIV infection in someone who has been exposed to HIV.  It prevents the user from contracting HIV with a 99% effectiveness rate.  Condoms used for vaginal sex have an effectiveness rate in the high 90% range and for anal sex an effectiveness rate in, I think, the high 70% range.<\/p> <p>This is an extra tool in the prevention of HIV.  Anyone who can get hold of PrEP is being responsible and is doing good work for the blood supply in this case.  However, under the current IBTS policy, a man who has sex with another man is allowed to give blood after 12 months, but someone who has taken extra precaution and extra safety measures now has to wait five years.<\/p> <p>The reply to the parliamentary question by the Minister, Deputy Harris, stated that a study in the US showed a sharp rise in STIs in men on PrEP and associated the use of PrEP with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with an STI.  We researched this and the only study we could find was one by Scott and Klausner, which contains questionable referencing and is pretty thin evidence on which to hang an entire new policy.  Ireland is the only country we can find that prevents people who are taking PrEP from giving blood.<\/p> <p>Before Christmas I attended an LGBTQI community discussion in the Cobblestone in Smithfield.  It was organised by ACT UP.  It was everything one could hope for from a positive community engagement and discussion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What struck me about the event was that members of the gay community spoke publicly and took ownership of a whole range of issues, from Grindr and drugs to sex and chemsex.

I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  While I might not be able to give the Senator all the responses he needs, I will certainly relay his views to the Minister.<\/p> <p>The remit of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, is to provide a safe, reliable and robust blood service to the health system.  It keeps all its deferral policies under constant review to ensure the ongoing safety of the blood supply.  It is in this context that, on 16 January 2017, the permanent exclusion of men who have sex with men from donating blood was changed to a 12-month deferral from their most recent sexual contact with another man.  While this one-year deferral protects against the risk of transmission of HIV, issues could arise in regard to an emerging infection.  In this regard, those who have had a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia or genital herpes are deferred for five years after completion of treatment.  Those who have had syphilis, gonorrhoea or other specified sexually transmitted infections are already permanently excluded from donating blood.<\/p> <p>The general approach of the IBTS to blood donation is that adults are eligible to donate provided they fulfil the donation criteria.  One of the fundamental criteria is that they must not have been involved in an activity or visited an area where they could be exposed to viruses that have been identified as risk factors that could compromise the ongoing safety of the blood supply.  The IBTS has a range of operational options available to it to implement management measures to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.  All these measures are aimed at minimising, or acting on, identified risks.<\/p> <p>The inclusion of Question No. 52 in the donor health and lifestyle questionnaire, which coincided with the change in the donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men, is one example of an extra precaution taken by the IBTS to protect recipients of blood and blood products.  The question asks potential blood donors whether in the past five years they have taken medication to prevent HIV infection.  The medication involved is pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, PEP.  Persons who have taken PrEP or PEP to prevent HIV infection are also deferred for a five-year period.  Studies of gay and bisexual men have shown that PrEP reduces the likelihood of HIV infection by more than 90% if used consistently.  A common concern is that PrEP will also lead people to stop using condoms, putting them at risk of other sexually transmitted infections.<\/p> <p>A study published in the United States in 2016 showed a sharp rise in sexually transmitted infections in men on PrEP and associated the use of PrEP with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection.  If the Senator has not been able to find any information bar this study, I will request that the Minister revert to him on this.  Perhaps he could seek further clarification on the which study this actually is.<\/p> <p>More broadly, the IBTS has protocols in place to minimise transfusion-transmitted infection of blood.  This risk is at its highest when individuals donate blood during the five-day to 16-day period following exposure to a virus when there is no biological measure to detect infectivity.  As a consequence, the IBTS temporarily or permanently defers from giving blood an average of one in five people who are ineligible to donate for a variety of reasons on the day they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#B00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I accept a common concern is that PrEP may lead people to stop using condoms, thereby putting them at risk of other sexually transmitted diseases or infections.  In light of the lifting of the lifetime ban preventing gay men from donating blood and the introduction of a 12-year deferral period, the policy is an admission that HIV can be caught in a 12-month period.  The concern is that sexually transmitted diseases could be caught in that 12-month period also.  What we are saying is that the five-year wait is extreme.  It is a considerable amount of time and we do have to challenge it.  What is the logic of demanding that those who take extra safety measures be required to wait five years rather than one?  If HIV can be caught in the 12-month period, I do not see the need for those who take PrEP to be deferred for five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#B00300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Minister of State probably cannot add much more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#B00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>To reiterate, there are two different groups of sexually transmitted infections, and individuals infected by some of them are permanently excluded from donating.

It is timely that I raise it again today.  The Minister stated at the energy security conference just this week that the question of importing liquefied natural gas to the island and the role of natural gas storage would be under consideration by his Department.  I warmly welcome that statement.  The Minister is to be commended for organising such an important energy conference at this time, especially in light of the very real threat to our future energy security posed by Brexit.  We are almost totally dependent on the United Kingdom for our gas supply.  Over 90% of our supply in 2015 was from the United Kingdom.  Even with Corrib gas coming on stream, it is estimated we will have a dependency rate of 85% by 2025.  Bearing in mind that we have a reserve capacity of only 5%, Ireland is clearly disadvantaged.  This must be very worrying, as the Minister recognised in his statement.  The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies reached the same conclusion in its January report.  I referred to that last Thursday, fortuitously anticipating the Minister.  I drew attention to the report.<\/p> <p>It is most fortunate, therefore, that we currently have in place the Shannon LNG project in north Kerry.  This was first announced by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister responsible for industry, almost ten years ago.  It has advanced very significantly in the intervening years.  Strategic planning approval was obtained in April 2008.  Pipeline construction approval was granted in May 2009, and foreshore leases and licences were obtained in December 2010.  At that stage, the project was \"ready to bid\", as goes the expression.  I happened to be Mayor of Kerry and a director of Shannon Foynes Port Company when the project was initiated.  It is quite remarkable that such a valuable project has taken so long to come to fruition.<\/p> <p>To date, approximately &euro;67 million has been spent on this project, including on engineering, site investigation, lease costs, pipeline rights of way and land acquisition.  The project hit a wall in 2012 when the energy regulator created new tariffing arrangements that had serious implications for a commercial LNG terminal.  These new arrangements would compel any new entrant to the energy market to contribute millions of euro annually to the interconnector network whether or not it required access to the interconnector.  Shannon LNG most certainly does not require such access.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Shannon LNG, in simple terms, is a self-standing buy and sell operation.  It should never have been penalised in this way.  I do not think the EU ever envisaged such penalties obtaining in this case.  As the Minister knows, there is a clear and present danger posed by Brexit to our energy security.  It is stated that Ireland is a special case within the EU because of our close dependence on the UK for so many aspects of our economy, not least energy.  As a result of that, if the EU is serious about assisting us through Brexit, this is one litmus test of its commitment.  Many aspects of the regulator's decisions must be reviewed urgently.  These regulations are going to have to be reassessed.<\/p><p>The Government will have to be more hands-on regarding the Kerry project, taking equity in it if necessary.  Shannon LNG, which has been long anticipated in an area in which is devastated by unemployment and emigration, will finally become a reality.  If the Shannon LNG project did not exist, the Government would have to invent it for itself.  Clearly, much of the heavy lifting has been done and the operation is by a private company with full back-up and full support from all the State agencies, the harbour, the local authority and, most importantly, the community of north Kerry, which has embraced this and has such high hopes for it.  I hope the Minister will be able to give a favourable response to my presentation and move this project forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#B00800","speaker":"1394","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>That was a very well researched question to the Minister.

It will impact on our economy and society due to the close links between Ireland the United Kingdom.  It has implications for everyone on this island, North and South.  Many sectors of the Irish economy have high levels of trade with the UK.  However, the energy sector has one of the highest levels of interdependence with the UK, and one of the key links is energy, as most of the energy we import comes via the UK.  Natural gas is a significant part of our energy mix, meeting approximately one quarter of all our energy needs.  We use natural gas to generate over 40% of our electricity, heat many of our homes and fuel a significant amount of our businesses and industry.  In 2015, 97% of the natural gas used in Ireland was imported via the UK.  We also have our own indigenous source of natural gas, the vast majority of which comes from the Corrib gas field, which started production at the end of 2015.  In the short term, Corrib will supply over half of our natural gas needs.  However, it is expected that these supplies will deplete over the next seven to eight years, and by 2025 Ireland will most likely again be reliant on the UK for around 85% of our natural gas needs.<\/p> <p>The proper functioning of our economy and society is reliant on energy.  As the report referred to by the Senator suggests, the issue of security of supply is extremely important, and preserving the existing structures with the United Kingdom is the best way to ensure this security.  In this regard, the continued secure trade in energy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of the 27 member states of the European Union is a priority for me.  I will work to ensure the current strong energy relationship with the United Kingdom continues but in the European context.  Ireland is, and will remain, a committed member state of the European Union, and our energy future will be very much as part of the European internal energy market.  I note that Ireland has an existing intergovernmental arrangement with the United Kingdom in regard to trade in natural gas across the two interconnectors connecting Ireland with Scotland.  In addition to these bilateral arrangements, there are arrangements and protocols in place between the transmission system operators in Ireland and Great Britain.<\/p> <p>Gas Networks Ireland is also in the process of doubling the onshore section of the gas pipeline in Scotland to further enhance the resilience of our gas supplies from the United Kingdom.  The report referred to by the Senator goes on to state that in the absence of the existing structures with the UK, an LNG regasification terminal might be needed.  LNG is one option that will be considered to ensure our security of supply.  I agree that the potential benefits of importing LNG directly onto the island of Ireland, and also the role of natural gas storage, must be examined in the context of Brexit.  Indeed, A Programme for a Partnership Government, agreed in May 2016, commits to examining if there are ways to facilitate LNG on the island of Ireland.  This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s energy policy paper, Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030, which commits to conducting a thorough analysis of options for increased gas storage and LNG potential.  My Department has recently commenced the process of developing a report to identify options in order to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s resilience to a long-term gas and electricity disruption.  Part of this report will identify potential options to improve resilience, including the potential for LNG, storage, interconnection and fuel diversification.  <\/p> <p>I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns and my Department and I are working to identify the appropriate solutions that are in the best interests of our people.  We have a number of options available for LNG, both on-shore and off-shore options.  We will explore all those options.  I have spoken with my Latvian counterpart about the off-shore option that has been used and been hugely successful in Latvia in driving down the cost of energy.  All these options are on the table.  I know there is an issue at the moment with the development of the site in Foynes and the port company is dealing with that.  Once those issues are resolved, we are quite willing to engage with the successful bidders to see how we can explore the progression of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#C00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, which I find encouraging.

Some 40% of all power generated on that grid comes from gas.  That interconnection is vitally important for Northern Ireland as well.  We have always had a strong relationship with Whitehall in the energy area because of that interconnectivity.<\/p> <p>Every European country must have 90 days oil storage within its own jurisdiction or within another member state of the European Union.

In regard to the proposed LNG terminal at Ballylongford in north Kerry, the Programme for a Partnership Government expressed support for the proposal to construct an LNG terminal as it would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  It is also important to point out from discussions with my European colleagues that we are looking at trying to connect up LNG facilities right across Europe.  Many of my colleagues in Europe, particularly in central Europe, are quite critical of the lack of connectivity between LNG terminals on the coast of Europe connecting with the main grid networks throughout Europe.  We need to be conscious of that as well.<\/p><p>My Department has supported this project in becoming an EU project of common interest and, although not successful, it also supported the application for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility for the gas pipeline from the proposed terminal into the gas network itself.  In terms of engaging with the promoters of the Ballylongford project, as the Senator is aware, I met the principal parties and my parliamentary colleagues to discuss the project.  Officials in my Department have also engaged with the relevant parties to assist, as appropriate.  However, while I will provide any support I can in regard to assistance sought from the EU, this is a commercial project and, therefore, the question of Exchequer or other public funding for this project does not arise.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the development of an LNG terminal is one possible option to secure our natural gas supply in the context of Brexit.  However, the continued trade in energy between the UK and EU member states is a priority.  As I pointed out at the civic dialogue on Brexit, which I hosted in Boyne in County Roscommon earlier this week, we must be careful not to over-commit on particular technologies.  I will consider the outcome of the study by my Department on the resilience of the long-term gas or electricity disruption and the recommendation it presents before making any decision on our long-term energy security.<\/p><p>As someone who in a previous life was a spokesperson on transport, shadowing the late Seamus Brennan, I took a huge interest in Foynes Port and the huge potential of the Shannon estuary.

They travelled across the country to my home town of Drogheda to tell me their individual stories on foot of a report in <i>The Guardian<\/i>in November of 2015.  The then Government, of which I was a member, moved to introduce an atypical permit scheme for non-EEA fishermen.  It sought to do a couple of important things.  It introduced a work permit and visa scheme which would bestow all rights of Irish employment law on non-EEA fishermen who applied for and received valid permits and contracts of employment.  It also sought to ensure that there was a steady flow of legal and legitimate labour to work in an industry which depends on a predictable flow of skilled labour from Egypt and the Philippines, in particular, but also other states.  <\/p><p>In creating that new system, what we sought to do was to help restore the reputation of an industry that had been tarnished and, importantly, to protect the dignity and rights of those working in Ireland in a very exposed, fragmented and difficult to reach sector.  For the first six months of the scheme, applications were limited to those who were already here, but from what I have learned from the fishermen I have met, the International Transport Federation and from compliant trawler owners, with whom I have engaged, it is hard to conclude that the scheme has been a success.  There is a gulf, for example, between the official figures for permits issued and the reality on the ground.  I have encountered situations where some workers who have valid permits are effectively on the run because of disputes that they have had with skippers on the trawlers on which they were working.  One worker from Egypt, who has been here for a number of years, has effectively been banished from the community in which he works because of a very legitimate dispute over the non-payment of wages.  He has a valid permit, but he is receiving absolutely no protection from the State.  I have, in some cases, sought emergency social welfare payments to assist some of these people to make ends meet only to be told that, in the first instance, they must report to the Irish National Immigration Service or the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  I have heard testimony from some that they were being paid the national minimum wage rate for a 39-hour week, which would amount to around &euro;360, while working on vessels for in excess of 100 hours per week in many cases.  This is illegal and these kinds of claims need to be investigated.  The rights of these workers need to be vindicated by the State.<\/p><p>Months into the operation of the scheme, as I said, I met with 40 fishermen from across the country in Drogheda.  I was alarmed that of those 40 workers with whom I spoke only four claimed to have valid permits to work.  The Minister may have seen a report by Lorna Siggins in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that a Mr. Elsisi from the Egyptian embassy said that he believed up to 2,000 Egyptians are working on Irish trawlers, North and South.  The scheme limits the number of permits to be issued to 500, and nothing even close to that number has been issued.  I have in my possession a letter of approval from the Department of Justice and Equality, issued in November of 2016, to allow a certain Egyptian fisherman to come to Ireland.  The truth is that the said fisherman was already living and working here since 2014.

It is now almost 18 months since the issue of the employment of non-EEA crew members in the Irish fishing fleet was highlighted in the media as an issue of concern.  <i>The Guardian<\/i>, in particular, highlighted issues, with claims of exploitation of migrant workers on Irish fishing trawlers.  Following these revelations, the Government moved swiftly to address the concerns and abuses highlighted through an inter-departmental task force chaired by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, which was established in November 2015.  The task force, of which the Senator in his then capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment was an active member, met on a number of occasions and a new scheme was developed that addressed the issues of concern, improved the situation for non-EEA workers, reduced the possibility of abuse and allowed the fishing industry to meet its labour needs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As one of the authors of the report, the Senator is aware that the scheme only applies to crew members working on licensed and registered fishing vessels in the polyvalent, beamer and other specific segments of the Irish fleet where the vessels are more than 15 m in length overall, multi-crewed and labour intensive.<\/p><p>The role of the T&aacute;naiste's Department comes at the end of a process that clears the way for a non-EEA national to be employed on a particular boat after the input of the various departmental and statutory bodies with oversight of the sector.  The Department of Justice and Equality provides, through a special atypical working scheme for seafarers, work permission for non-EEA fishermen.  This permission provides an appropriate pathway through which this category of worker can be lawfully employed within the industry.  Following this, the relevant statutory bodies responsible for implementing employment law, including employment protection, can effectively discharge their responsibilities as part of the overall regulatory regime for the employment of non-EEA workers.  The programme commenced on 15 February 2016 and, for the first three months, applications were confined to non-EEA crew members who were already working in the Irish fishing industry.  However, owing to the slow uptake of the scheme, the Department extended the initial three-month period from 15 May to 30 June 2016.<\/p><p>The new scheme required the establishment of the central depository of contracts, managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to record, examine and monitor the number of contracts in the scheme which was to be capped at a maximum of 500; a pre-clearance system managed by the central depository to be introduced for all applications; and the grant of atypical working permission.  Like many other others, the fishing industry is not immune to abuse by unscrupulous employers.  Therefore, it is important that these overall arrangements which involve the co-operation of all stakeholders remain a deterrent to such abuses to protect employees.  To that end, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have worked with others within the industry to ensure compliance where issues arise that were not dealt with by the appropriate authorities.  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality have contacted their counterparts in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to meeting to assess the overall operation of the scheme to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#D01100","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am glad that there are moves afoot to review the operation of the scheme, but it has been brought into disrepute to a certain degree by what I have heard directly from fishermen from Egypt, some of whom have been in Ireland for years and are still operating without permits.  I was shocked to read testimony in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday in an article by Ms Lorna Siggins who had attended a meeting organised by the International Transport Workers Federation in Liberty Hall.  It is unprecedented for a representative of a foreign embassy in this country to draw the State's attention to a matter of this seriousness through the national media and make a claim that, of the approximately 2,000 of the representative's fellow countrymen operating in Ireland, many hundreds were without valid permits, even though a permit system was in place.  The scheme could be better enforced.  There were difficulties in getting it off the ground.  The Minister alluded to this when he stated the initial three-month period had to be extended for a variety of reasons, even though it had been intended to limit the scheme to those living in Ireland.  There is some common ground between employers and the trade union representing workers.  The common view is that the scheme can and should be improved.

After the 2011 census, the then Minister, Phil Hogan, established a boundary commission in 2013 to consider introducing local government municipal districts.  The subsequent proposals must be reviewed.  The figure of 1,653 representatives - 883 councillors and 773 town councillors - has been reduced to approximately 950.  The main issue with municipal districts is that there is none in any of the three major cities of Cork, Galway and Dublin.  That makes no sense.<\/p> <p>There are other flaws, one of the greatest of which was that we used electoral districts as a means of sorting out constituency divisions.  That made no sense either.  For example, the town of Carrigaline which has a population of 20,000 people has been split in two because of an electoral district divide.  Half of the town is in the Carrigaline-Ballincollig electoral district, a ten-seat constituency, while the other half is in the Bandon-Kinsale electoral district, a six-seater.  That is illogical.  The town was divided because the Department used the electoral districts which were formed in 1850 at the time of the Famine as guidelines.<\/p> <p>We must re-examine the system for devising all boundaries, be they for D&aacute;il, European Parliament or local government elections.  The world has moved on.  In using electoral districts we are going nowhere.  We must move forward.  The Department needs to consider using an up-to-date system to divide constituencies.  Illogically, we have created ten-seat constituencies.  Adopting the criteria used in the previous review, most are six to ten-seat constituencies.  Ludicrously, Ireland now has six ten-seat, 13 nine-seat and 23 eight-seat constituencies.  One of the ten-seat constituencies in Cork covers more than 70,000 people in Carrigaline, Ballincollig and the southern half of Cork city.  That is the size of a D&aacute;il constituency.  There is no representation on the ground because these areas are too vast.  The old constituencies had three to seven seats.  We need to return to them in order that there can be actual local government.  The current system needs to change because it is not working.<\/p> <p>We must consider other issues.  Previously, there was one councillor per 4,800 people outside the two major cities of Cork and Dublin.  We limited the number of councillors in Cork to 55 and to 63 in Dublin, which made no sense in the context of the principle of one person, one vote.  On the other side, as the Acting Chairman knows better than me, is the county council constituency of west Cork which stretches for 110 miles.  It starts at Courtmacsherry and ends beyond Glengarriff near Kenmare.<\/p> <p>The entire system needs to be reviewed.  We have seen what happens when we stick to electoral districts.  They do not work.  The census has been carried out and the elections will be held in 2019.  The preparatory work must start now.  If we go into it in the way we did previously just nine months before the local elections, we will not achieve the desired result.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to examine the geographical areas in order to ensure constituencies are not too big and do not consist of eight, nine or ten seats, yet still provide good representation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#E00700","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The Senator's points have been very well made and represented the views of many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#F00200","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government who cannot attend today.<\/p> <p>The reviews and revisions of local electoral areas have been carried out over the years in response to changing needs, including population changes.  The most recent review was carried out in advance of the 2014 local elections.  Before that, reviews were carried out in 2008, 1998 and 1985.  Unlike the position for D&aacute;il constituencies, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement to review local electoral area boundaries.  Having said that, the Minister for Housing. Planning, Community and Local Government is empowered by section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001 to divide each county, city or city and county into local electoral areas and to amend those areas.  Each of them must have a council.  This can be done following a review by a boundary committee established under the Local Government Act 1991.  The terms of reference for a local electoral area boundary committee are set by the Minister of the day.<\/p> <p>The terms of reference for the last review included a requirement to have regard to the new arrangements for local government set out in the government's Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  The review had the specific goal of achieving a better balance and consistency in representational ratios than were in place before that time.  The committee was asked to design local electoral areas on the basis of there being one member for every 4,830 population in each council area.  This was subject to a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 40 members in every authority with exceptions for Cork County with 55 members and Dublin City with 63 members.  Local electoral areas were to be represented by between no fewer than six and no more than ten members.<\/p> <p>The Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee was established in November 2012 and reported to the Minister at the end of May 2013.  The Minister accepted the recommendations of the committee in full.  The new local electoral areas were specified in 30 statutory instruments made in January 2014.  At the 2014 local elections, 949 councillors were elected in 137 local electoral areas to 31 local authorities.  These local electoral areas provided the basis for the configuration of the new municipal districts that came into operation following the 2014 local elections.  These structures are the framework for the new model of municipal governance that was introduced in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  This new model was designed primarily to strengthen local government within counties and to address the widely acknowledged and long-standing weaknesses and anomalies in the previous system.<\/p> <p>In 2015, the first full year of the revised local government structures, a broadly based advisory group was convened to carry out a review of their operation.  This was done in conjunction with the local government forum for the engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations, as well as the results of surveys of local authority members and chief executives, indicate that the revised structures are generally operating well but need more time to bed down fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#F00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It is important to invite the Minister to the House for a debate because we need to know whether there will be a boundary review and, if not, how he will work with the satellite towns that are divided in two.  I have mentioned Carrigaline because it does not make sense to have 8,500 on one side and 12,000 on another side.  Major anomalies exist locally and in other counties.<\/p> <p>The structure for municipal districts has worked.  Local authorities need to have an idea where structures will be placed.  The knock-on effect of imposing different constituencies eight or 12 months before a local election is due to take place will mean different structures.  In other words, districts will change as will the management, population and everything else.  Clarity is required.  If we have clarity, the management and public representatives can make plans.

Sometimes these districts do not work that well when the population is dispersed.<\/p> <p>The Senator is right that we must examine anomalies and challenges, particularly on a geographical basis.

The Senator made a valid point for a review by pointing out that many towns are divided by district divisions.  My own constituency is divided by a district division.  The town of Dunmore is in two D&aacute;il constituencies.  Part of the town is in the constituency of east Galway and the remaining part is in the constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  Most towns and rivers have a drain or a river running through them, which causes problems in terms of district divisions.  The same applies to disadvantaged areas.

For many years Sinn F&eacute;in has produced alternative budgets that honestly set out the measures needed to address the shortcomings in the health service.  On many occasions, the Leader has used these as a stick to beat Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>I would also like to see a debate, as was called for by Senator Conway yesterday, on exactly how we fund health care in the future, rather than statements on the difficult choices regarding tax and expenditure that will have to be made.  In the last budget, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il chose the &euro;290 million in tax cuts over increased capital spend.  Sinn F&eacute;in clearly demonstrated how &euro;267 million extra could be spent on 500 additional hospital beds, reducing the prescription charges by &euro;1 each and increasing ambulance cover, as well as improving mental health services.<\/p> <p>What is difficult for an economic illiterate like myself to understand is why the Government would choose to facilitate a tax avoidance measure for foreign vulture funds amounting to up to &euro;350 million while at the same time denying citizens vital treatment unless they have the money to pay privately.  I cannot reconcile that.  Right at this moment, I know a man who is in absolutely excruciating pain waiting for vital treatment in my own constituency in Mayo.

As some Senators will know Tesco is Ireland's largest private employer, employing more than 11,000 staff.  Unfortunately, Tesco has also decided to go down the road of union busting.  It has hired a specialist firm of lawyers who engage in union busting as a career.  It is trying to drive Mandate, a fine trade union, out of Tesco.  We know this because some of the most loyal and hard-working staff in Tesco have been told their terms and conditions are to be cut unilaterally later this month.  As a result, Mandate has had no choice but to ballot its members and as things stand today they are to go on indefinite strike across nine stores with probably another 15 to follow from 14 February, St. Valentine's Day.<\/p> <p>Tesco is not making these cuts because it is somehow short of cash.  In fact, it has just bought out the biggest wholesaler in Britain.  It is doing extremely well.  It will not reveal its profits in Ireland, but we believe they are in the region of &euro;200 million to &euro;250 million a year.  It does not have to do this; it is not in financial difficulty.  Its sole reason for doing this is greed.  It wants to cut the terms and conditions of the longest-serving staff purely to increase its profits further.  It is the largest private-sector employer in the State.<\/p> <p>I am asking the Leader to bring the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Seanad to discuss the matter, which affects people throughout the State, and to make a clear stand on this.

Last week the Ornua chairman, Aaron Forde, pointed out that already five Ornua graduates have been refused visas to enter the US and two staff in the US were initially refused a renewal of their visas, although I understand that has been sorted out.  That is notwithstanding 30 years of operating in the US, marketing Irish dairy products.  Its success is shown by the 20,000 tonnes of Irish cheese and butter sold in the US, with Kerrygold the flagship company there.  This obviously has serious implications, not just for Ornua.<\/p> <p>In addition, we heard the bad news of job losses Leixlip.  Some 150,000 people here work for US multinationals and 250,000 people work in Irish companies in the US.  We also have the issue of the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the US.  Many of us might not agree with the approach of the current US President in putting America first, in terms of making the country safer and his attitude to Muslims in particular.  We are seeing fallout in the tightening of regulations affecting Irish people who have obviously a track record there and in respect of whom there should not be a question about getting visas.<\/p> <p>There are issues relating to trade - America requires trade as do we - and relating to the illegal immigrants.  When one talks about making America great, if these people were not in America, how great would it be?  It seems that many people living there do not want to do those particular jobs.  It is now more important than ever that the Taoiseach should meet President Trump and have a conversation in the real world and keep communications open.  In the meantime I would welcome a debate here grounded in the reality that it is facing Irish companies, Irish citizens and our undocumented over the fallout from the changes that are apparent in the new Administration there.

From speaking to those involved in the formation of existing Government plans, it is clear the Department and the Minister wish to go further in applying a levy to derelict and vacant sites and get them back into use.

As a result, we now have more money coming in to provide a better health service.  An extra &euro;1 billion is being provided this year to the health service which we would not have been able to put in if people were not back at work.  I remind the Senator the level of corporation tax has increased by more than 70%.  It is at its highest level ever and will continue to rise in 2017 and 2018 because of the number of companies, the number of people employed, the amount of work being done and the amount of exports.

It would be interesting to look at the ratio of administrators to front-line staff in other jurisdictions.  This is an area where we need to examine major reform.  We need to get value for money.

The Minister for Health appeared on the national broadcaster to say he was ashamed and heartbroken at the revelations made.  I think he is a decent man, but the policies he has put in place and the ones put in place by Fianna F&aacute;il before him are indecent.  There has been chronic under-investment for many years in every corner of the health service, from primary care services to home care packages, nursing units, community hospitals and acute hospitals.  When there is such a situation, it creates the bottlenecks that result in so many citizens being on trolleys.  In recent days we have learned that in nursing units and community hospitals in County Donegal and, no doubt, throughout the State elderly people are being told that no respite care services will be available to them because beds need to be freed up for patients from the major acute hospitals.  We are robbing Peter to pay Paul again.  Similarly, if one looks at the numbers on waiting lists, the reason they are increasing and there are so many cancellations is the use of the full capacity protocol whereby people are told their procedures or operations have been cancelled because beds must be freed up in hospitals in which so many beds have been closed.  One could not make up this stuff.  Let us be real.  The solution to the crisis lies in adequate investment.  I argue that there is a need for a five-year plan to ensure adequate investment in the provision of beds and nurses.  The crisis will not be solved overnight, but a clear five-year plan needs to be outlined now.  It is not enough for a Minister to say they are ashamed or heartbroken at the latest crisis or scandal.<\/p> <p>My next point concerns broadband.  I propose that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment come to the House to update us on the timeframe for the roll-out of broadband.  The rural development action plan was launched recently, but everybody who represents a rural area knows that we need a timeframe for the provision of broadband for every home.

One aspect of the problem concerns the welfare of prisoners discharged from the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum and transferred to prison.  They may have posed a danger to themselves and others but integration into the prison environment poses further challenges for them.  Last week one man said on \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" on RTE that he had been treated in the Central Mental Hospital for 15 years having been found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity.  Depending on their condition, other patients spend far less time receiving therapeutic care at the Central Mental Hospital and are returned to prison following a clinical assessment.  I would like the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Health to provide a detailed update on provisions for the continuity of psychiatric care and the monitoring of such persons on entering the prison system from hospital.  What support do these inmates specifically receive prior to discharge and what follow-on treatment and health services can they expect to receive subsequently while in State custody?  I echo the call of the Irish Penal Reform Trust for the roll-out nationwide of institutional high support services for mentally ill prisoners, including those in Mountjoy Prison and Cloverhill Prison.  In August 2006 a 21 year old man was killed in Mountjoy Prison by another inmate who had been transferred there from the Central Mental Hospital.  The 2014 report on his death highlighted failures on the part of prison and psychiatric services.  Up to 30 people who are psychotic or awaiting admission to an acute mental health facility are in prison at any one time.  How are these waiting lists managed?  What is the current level of communication and co-operation between health care and prison staff in the different institutions in dealing with these cases?  We need to look very seriously at this issue.  Prison is the last place people who are mentally ill should be incarcerated.  There is an urgent need for the Government to address this growing problem among the 3,700 inmates in custody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#K00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I sympathise with the 500 people who will lose their jobs following the announcement made by Hewlett-Packard this morning.

Unfortunately, the news was not new to some of us as public representatives.  We knew that it had been happening for quite some time, but it had been denied on a regular basis by the HSE.  Having listened to commentators in the past couple of hours, many international experts suggest the availability of funding is not the difficulty.

I join Senators Catherine Ardagh, Aidan Davitt and Diarmuid Wilson in offering solidarity and our thoughts to the men and women employed at Hewlett Packard in Leixlip who have this morning heard the appalling, tragic news of job losses.  It is most disappointing and words will be of little solace to those who work there.  I hope the arms of State will work to assist them in re-engaging in the workforce as quickly as possible.  I have heard the contributions of some Senators, but this has nothing to do with Brexit or the policies of President Trump but about the company restructuring its policy globally.  There are other Hewlett Packard entities in Galway and Cork and it is important to stand with the workers today.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has engaged with the company.  As Senator Diarmuid Wilson said, this is not just about the plant in Leixlip where 10,000 people are employed, although it is a pivotal flagship for IDA Ireland.  It is important, however, that we engage proactively with the men and women who work there to assist them in every possible manner.<\/p> <p>Senator Catherine Ardagh referred to the national children's hospital.  As a former Chairman of the health committee who was on the St. James's Hospital site with Senator Colm Burke and others, I played a role in ensuring the project would be prioritised.  The contract has been awarded to BAM and is worth &euro;3 billion.  The comment of the chief executive of the HSE was made at a private meeting of the health committee, although in my opinion he should not have made it because it has muddied the water.  I share Senator Catherine Ardagh's concern and join her in asking for the position to be clarified.  I ask her not to push the matter to a vote because the Minister for Health who is prepared to brief her and any other Member of the House personally has to make a business case to the Government which is committed to this flagship project.  The contract has been approved by the HSE directorate.  The priority of the Government is to ensure the project is built.  The discussion has moved on from considering the different sites proposed.  We have a site and there is a contract and the Minister has to make a business case to the Cabinet in order that the project can begin.  As we are all united on the need for a national children's hospital, I appeal to the Senator to allow what I have outlined to happen, rather than divide the House.<\/p> <p>Senators Rose Conway-Walsh, Colm Burke, P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Aidan Davitt and Diarmuid Wilson touched on the importance of the health service to us as a nation.  Leaving aside the harrowing distress outlined on the RTE programme, in 2017 the Department of Health will have funding of &euro;14.1 billion to meet current expenditure and &euro;454 million to meet capital expenditure.  Going by the economics and mathematics of Senator Rose Conway-Walsh which are of a higher standard than mine, these figures represents an increase of &euro;977 million on the budget for 2015, or an increase of 7.4% on the original voted budget and 3.5% on the final projected outturn.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Diarmuid Wilson that if the voodoo economics of Senator Rose Conway-Walsh's party in the North were to be transferred to the South, there would be bedlam.  We would have tractors on Grafton Street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>What nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Its Members can come into the House and spout their great theories, but it is a high tax and high spend party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Can the Leader explain why so many people are in pain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The Senator is not interested in the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I am really interested in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L00900","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The Senator is never interested in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L01000","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader and the Senators who are interjecting to, please, respect the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L01100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>This is a never-ending lecture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#L01200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh is never interested in knowing the real facts.

The purpose of this Bill is to empower the courts to make awards of damages in cases of catastrophic injury by way of periodic payments orders, PPOs.  The Bill will apply in cases involving both State and non-State defendants.  It addresses the concerns that have been raised repeatedly by the courts that the absence of such legislation has meant that the best option for a catastrophically injured person in the form of a periodic payments order has not been available.<\/p> <p>At the outset, I acknowledge the work that has been done by the High Court working group on medical negligence and periodic payments in bringing this matter to the fore.  Since the publication of the working group's report on this issue, my Department has been working with Government Departments, State agencies and stakeholders to develop the provisions of the Bill we now have before us.  As Senators will be aware, damages for personal injuries are currently paid by way of a lump sum.  The damages awarded to compensate for personal injuries are intended to put the injured party in the same position as they would have been in if they had not sustained the wrong for which they are now receiving compensation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Damages are assessed at a certain point in time and a lump sum is awarded which is intended to compensate for all past and future losses, including the cost of care, medication, aids a person might need and treatment.  The lump sum is intended to represent the capital value of future loss.  The working group on medical negligence and periodic payments noted in its report:<\/p><blockquote>The &quot;lump sum&quot; approach dictates that there is no recourse for a plaintiff who exhausts his fund by exceeding his [or her] projected [for example] life[time] expectancy...  Many catastrophically injured persons have spent their final years... without the means to pay for their care because the damages awarded have proved inadequate...  Similarly, a defendant has no recourse if a large lump sum is paid to a plaintiff who succumbs to his [or her] injuries earlier than expected.<\/blockquote><p>This, of course, means that the next of kin in some instances have received unintended multi-million euro amounts.<br\/><br\/>The principal recommendation made in the working group's report was to address the deficiencies in the lump sum system by giving the courts discretion to impose, with or without the consent of parties, periodic payment orders in catastrophic injury cases.  The working group recommended that periodic payment orders should be calculated to meet the cost of permanent and long-term care and treatment and should be index-linked.  The principal advantages of introducing periodic payment orders include the fact that inadequate compensation will be avoided as payments will be tied to the actual rather than the expected cost of care and treatment; that inappropriate compensation will be avoided as payments will be linked to actual rather than expected duration of life; and that, in addition, the payment of enormous lump sums will be avoided.<br\/><br\/>Since the publication of the report of the working group, the courts have made more than 50 interim periodic payment orders.  These interim periodic payment orders are subject to review by the courts on relevant returnable dates.  However, the courts have indicated that they do not favour settlement of claims by periodic payment order in the absence of legislation.  This Bill provides that a court shall have the power to award damages by way of periodic payment orders, where appropriate, having regard to the best interests of the plaintiff and all the circumstances of the case.  It contains provisions regarding the security and indexation of periodic payment orders.  In addition, the Bill will ensure that periodic payment orders will not be subject to income tax and that such payments will not be taken into account in the event of bankruptcy.  The introduction of the legislation will have a positive impact on persons with catastrophic injuries who require long-term care and assistance as it will ensure that they will have security with regard to the costs of care in their lifetimes. <br\/><br\/>Before moving to provide the House with details of the provisions of the Bill, I wish to state that I hope to bring forward a number of Committee Stage amendments relating to the issue of double recovery of health benefits and also in relation to open disclosure provisions which deal with supporting the open disclosure to patients of patient safety incidents.  We are working closely with the Department of Health on these matters.<br\/><br\/>I will outline briefly the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 of the Bill is a standard provision.  Section 2 is the main provision regarding periodic payment orders and sets out what we need to do to introduce them.  Section 51H is an interpretation section for the new Part.  Senators should note that catastrophic injury is defined as meaning &quot;a personal injury which is of such severity that it results in a permanent disability requiring the person to receive life-long care and assistance in all activities of daily living or a substantial part thereof&quot;.  As Senators can imagine, this definition has been the subject of much discussion among stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>Section 51I is the central provision relating to the power of the court to award damages by way of periodic payments orders.  Subsection (1) provides that, where it is awarding damages for personal injuries to a plaintiff who has suffered a catastrophic injury, a court may order that all or part of the damages for future medical treatment, future care of the plaintiff and the provision of assistive technology be paid in periodic payments.  Where the parties agree to do so, damages in respect of future loss of earnings may also be paid in periodic payments under the order.  Subsection (2) sets out the issues which the court must consider in deciding whether to make a periodic payments order.  The court must have regard to the best interests of the plaintiff, the individual circumstances, the nature of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the form of award which would best meet the needs of the plaintiff having regard to the preferences of all parties.  Subsections (4) and (5) deal with stepped payments.  A court may make provision that a periodic payment order may increase or decrease from a specified date to cater for anticipated changes in the plaintiff&rsquo;s needs.  Changes in circumstances which may form the basis of a stepped payment include entry into primary, secondary or third level education, reaching the age of 18 years or changes to the care needs of the person, which could include a transfer to residential care.<br\/><br\/>Section 51J deals with the vitally important issue of the security of periodic payment orders.  The section provides that a court may only make a periodic payment order where it is satisfied that the continuity of payments under it is reasonably secure.  The next section provides that a paying party must make an application to the court where it proposes to alter the method of payment of a periodic payment order.  I have already mentioned that these will be index-linked and the next section deals with the indexation of payments.  <br\/><br\/>Section 51M relates to the assignment, commutation or charging of a right to periodic payments.  This section seeks to address the risk that it could undermine the operation of the Bill if the right of commutation were not restricted, as a claimant could be encouraged to agree to commute their periodic payments order into a lump sum payment even if there were compelling reasons for the claimant to receive periodic payments.  The section provides that an application must be made to court for approval if a plaintiff wishes to assign, commute or charge the right to a periodic payment order.  Various appeals are allowed.<br\/><br\/>Section 51O provides that the new Part will apply to proceedings that are brought on or after the commencement of the Part or in respect of which no final decision has been made on the date of such commencement.  I will examine carefully the wording of this section between now and Committee Stage to ensure that the new provisions on periodic payment orders can apply to cases where a court has already made an interim order.  As stated, approximately 50 of those orders have been made already and we want to ensure, if it needs further amendment to do it, that such amendment is brought forward on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Insurance Act 1964.  Section 3 of the Insurance Act, as amended, deals with payments from the insurance compensation fund where an insurance company goes into liquidation.  Subsection (4) of the section deals with the maximum amounts that may be paid from the fund in the event of a liquidation of an insurance company.  It provides that the total amount that may be paid out of the fund in respect of any sum due to a person under a policy shall not exceed 65% of that sum or &euro;825,000, whichever is the less.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 provides that the limits specified in the Insurance Act 1964 shall not apply where the court has made a periodic payments order.  Consequently, where an insurance company becomes insolvent, the full amount due to a person entitled to receive payments under a periodic payment order will be paid from the insurance compensation fund. <br\/><br\/>There is a number of technical amendments to the Bankruptcy Acts.  Section 5 provides an exemption, as I have already mentioned, from income tax in respect of payments made to persons under a periodic payments order.  Section 6 of the Bill relates to the costs in personal injury cases.  <br\/><br\/>People have spoken about this Bill for a long time.  It is believed and understood that this is a far better way to approach these tragic cases.  The Bill will make a difference to the lives of people who have suffered catastrophic injuries by enabling the courts to give them what is in effect much needed financial security that is based more on their needs, including emerging needs, than a projection into the future.  The new measures can also support catastrophically injured persons without imposing undue liabilities on insurance companies or other defendants.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Bill to the House and hope Senators support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#O00600","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to the House and thank her for her statement on the Bill and her comprehensive run-through of its provisions.

We had a grotesque phenomenon called the Celtic tiger in the first decade of this century.  Many people who received significant payments as a result of catastrophic injuries would have found themselves in circumstances in which thsee payments were not channelled properly.  Deals might have been done for their care that were not in their best interests.  What we are seeing is a steadying of the ship that will ensure people's care is protected in the longer term.  Periodic payment ensures that if particular cost-punitive treatments not yet available are required in the future to deal with a catastrophic injury, we will be able to address the matter.  Thus, we will be able to provide the best possible care in 2027, just as we desire to have the best possible care provided in 2017.  That is what we all want to achieve.  Nobody ever wants to be in these circumstances, but when they are, we have a responsibility to ensure the proper checks, balances and protective mechanisms are in place to ensure their care is secured into the future.  Those who find themselves in these circumstances are equal to citizens who are in a position to go to work and earn a decent living.<\/p> <p>The Bill can be described as technical because the courts have been making periodic payments.  However, the legislation adds a structure to process.  That is what the courts wanted.  The structure is extremely important.  The Bill might be technical, but it will undoubtedly have a major effect on the lives of citizens.  I have no doubt all parties in the House, in addition to my own, will support the Bill as we are here to do the right thing.  The Bill represents one of the right things being done.  As Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee said, it probably should have been introduced years ago, but many things that should have happened years ago did not.  If everything happened when it should have, there would be no need for us.

Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes publication of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017 which, if enacted, will enable the courts to award periodic payment orders, PPOs, to compensate injured victims in cases of catastrophic injury where long-term permanent care is required instead of awarding lump sums in damages, as is the norm in these cases.<\/p> <p>The Bill arose from the recommendations of the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments.  It was established in February 2010 under the leadership of the then justice of the High Court Mr. John Quirke to examine the system in the courts for the management of claims for damages arising from alleged medical negligence and to identify shortcomings within that system.  The group concluded that the system for awarding damages for future pecuniary losses - the lump sum award - was inadequate and inappropriate and should be replaced by periodic payments.  An observation I would make on the working group's report concerns the membership of the committee.  It included representatives of the various relevant State Departments and the persons with whom the group engaged.  There was much discussion with the insurance companies but consultation with the families of those tasked with the care of their loved ones or the persons with catastrophic injuries who still had capacity was sadly lacking.  I would like to see this issue being addressed by the Minister.  Perhaps there might be an opportunity to address it when the Bill makes its way to Committee Stage.  It has been a long-standing issue for many families where there has been a victim of medical negligence which has resulted in catastrophic injury.  I note, in particular, the calls made by Ms Karen O'Mahony over a number of years.  She ended up having to go to the High Court three times to secure a settlement for her son who had suffered a brain injury owing to medical negligence when in 2001 Cork University Hospital failed to provide proper post-operative care in treating a brain tumour.  Following his catastrophic injuries, Eoin O'Mahony was quadriplegic and suffered from locked-in syndrome which required him to receive 24-hour care from a team of professionals.  It should not have taken the O'Mahony family 14 years and three trips to the High Court to secure a settlement dto guarantee the necessary care and support throughout their son's life.  Owing to the lack of PPOs, Ms O'Mahony and her husband were compelled to endure arduous court battles to ensure their son received the care he needed.  In the aftermath, they were vocal about their belief this legislation was needed.<\/p> <p>While we recognise that legal costs can be incredibly high, it is disappointing that the State Claims Agency and others have seen fit to tarnish the lawyers who advocate for families and individuals who suffer from catastrophic injuries as vultures out to milk the HSE when, in fact, it is the State Claims Agency that fights tooth and nail before inevitably admitting liability and negligence.  Families should not be made to feel like pariahs for seeking payment to access the care their loved ones need.  It should not come as a surprise when the option of mediation is often turned down.<\/p> <p>We have some concerns about the Bill that warrant further scrutiny.  I note, in particular, section 51L which deals with the indexation of payments.  It will allow for the adjustment of a PPO in line with the cost of living.  It is the cost of labour, however, that is the main component of care costs.  This may be an issue down the road.<\/p> <p>While there are people such as the O'Mahonys who would like PPOs to be introduced, there are others who want things to be over and done with in one go because they cannot face sporadic engagements where the costs of care go up or down.  The difficulty with lump sum awards arises when a person exceeds his or her life expectancy.  Suddenly, the money to provide care is gone and the State is obliged to fill the gap with varying degrees of success.  Very often, persons are compelled to invest the award in order to make it last.  The austerity years demonstrated just how difficult that was for persons who needed a guaranteed return to fund their medical care in the long term.<\/p> <p>The report of 2010 recommended that the variation of PPOs be permitted where it had been determined that the plaintiff's condition would seriously deteriorate or improve.  Given the nature of catastrophic injuries, we recognise that miracle recoveries are rare but, that aside, we do not want to see circumstances in which families are dragged back to court for contested PPO hearings where they are unnecessary.  <\/p> <p>We will allow the Bill to go further and will be suggesting further amendments on Committee Stage.

In my job as a solicitor down the years, I dealt with many UK-based insurance companies that were regularly bemused by how we did not have PPOs.  I welcome that these are now being introduced.<\/p><p>The Bill empowers the courts to make awards of damages in cases of catastrophic injury by way of PPO, thereby providing financial security for the injured person.  I have a background in medical negligence cases and, more recently, regular broader personal injuries defence work.  That the Bill is meeting the significant need for certainty is welcome.<\/p><p>I hope to see this much-needed Bill enacted as early as possible in 2017.  However, it contains a number of slight limitations.  I shall elaborate on them shortly.  In addition to giving the courts power to award damages by way of PPOs, the Bill will set out principles regarding the security of PPOs, provide that they shall be subject to yearly indexation, and amend the Insurance Act 1964, the Bankruptcy Act 1988 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It will also amend the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to provide for formal orders of settlement and costs in personal injury actions involving PPOs.  These measures stem from the recommendations of the report of the High Court working group on medical negligence and periodic payments, chaired by Mr. Justice John Quirke.  The report was produced following an intensive policy analysis and consultation process involving various Departments, including the Departments of Finance and Health.  Representatives of the insurance sector and the Injuries Board were consulted.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has gone through the Bill's provisions.  Section 51H is crucial, in that it defines \"catastrophic injury\" as meaning \"a personal injury which is of such severity that it results in a permanent disability requiring the person to receive life-long care and assistance in all activities of daily living or a substantial part thereof\".  This section also provides a definition of \"activities of daily life\" as including dressing, eating, walking, washing and bathing.  It is clear that the persons at whom this legislation is aimed are vulnerable and do not need to have the financial worries that often go with such injuries.  Every Senator has heard of cases in which lump sums were paid to individuals who might not necessarily have the best ability to balance their books and had run out of money.  Such cases can be tragic.  As such, the Bill's measures are welcome.<\/p><p>In deciding whether to make a PPO, the court must have regard to the best interests of the plaintiff and take account of the circumstances of the individual case, including the nature of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the form of award that would best meet his or her needs, having regard to the preferences of all parties.  A court may order that a PPO will increase or decrease from a specified date by a specified amount - a stepped payment, as such - to cater for anticipated changes in the plaintiff's needs, for example, entry into primary, secondary or third level education, reaching the age of 18 years or changes to the care needed, including transfer to residential care.<\/p><p>The Bill only applies to catastrophically-injured people.  Furthermore, a periodic settlement can be awarded unilaterally by the court for the costs of future care, but it can only be awarded for the loss of future earnings if there is agreement between the parties.  This is a limitation in the Bill and we should strive to increase the provision.  As a result of this limitation, a significant number of patients will still be paid by lump sum.  If the injured party lives for a long time with a permanent disability, it is almost inevitable that the award will run out, consequently leaving the injured party in a vulnerable position.  I would be in favour of a level playing field.  An injured plaintiff should be able to choose between a periodic payment and a lump sum in all large cases involving substantial special damages.  Perhaps that will not be possible in this Bill, but we should strive towards it.  The Helmot case in Guernsey is an example.  Cases of this type involve a sizable and permanent loss of earnings as well as a lack of support for dependants.  Surely such cases ought to have the option of a fully periodic award that can provide for people's long-term needs without the threat of lump sums running out.<\/p><p>The current proposals may be too rigid and we could work towards improving certain points in the coming years.  There is no logic in allowing future care costs while permitting a defendant to veto a PPO in respect of lost earnings.  Why would loss of earnings not be routinely compensated by periodic payments?  We are familiar with old age pensions, permanent health insurance benefits and disability pensions, all of which are paid periodically.  The objective is to strike a balance of fairness.  We must also be wary, in that the State Claims Agency and insurance companies will want to restrict the use of periodic payments as much as possible.  This Bill does that, but we as legislators must take a more balanced view and ensure that the consumer does not bear the brunt of this legislation.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and commend the T&aacute;naiste and her officials on their work in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#Q00400","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House and echo Senator Conway's welcome of the passage through the D&aacute;il of the sex offences Bill, which I look forward to being before the Seanad next week.  I hope that the Bill's reform of prostitution law will be brought into effect swiftly, as per the justice committee's recommendation.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste in that regard.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I welcome the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017.  It has received a general welcome as a sensible and long-overdue measure that needed to be introduced in the interests of individuals who have suffered catastrophic personal injury.  As the T&aacute;naiste and others have acknowledged, there is real human tragedy behind the Bill's purpose.  Any of us who has practised law will have encountered cases involving horrific injuries from time to time.  They are reported on in the courts occasionally.<\/p> <p>It is good to see the Bill finally.  It is more than six years since the final report of the working group was published in October 2010.  At the time, it was anticipated that this legislation would be introduced swiftly.  Soon after the report's publication, parties to personal injury cases began to negotiate informal interim settlements involving periodic payments.  The T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged that more than 50 interim PPOs have been negotiated and made since 2010.  However, the delay in introducing this legislation has caused serious problems.  I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for documenting for us some of the impacts that the delay has had.  We saw the creation of a special personal injuries list in the Dublin High Court following the publication of the working group report in anticipation of legislation being swiftly passed that would provide a structure for PPOs.  However, six years passed.  Last year, the president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, stated that it was shameful that legislation had not yet been introduced to provide for a system of PPOs in a case involving a 13 year old boy suffering from cerebral palsy due to medical negligence during his birth.  In 2016, the court finally approved an &euro;8 million lump sum payment following a number of adjournments to see if periodic payments could be made.<\/p> <p>The delay in the legislation's passage has had an impact.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is very good to see it finally but the delay does need to be emphasised.  As we have said, it is clearly in the interests of those suffering catastrophic injury that this would be available to them.  It has been available in the UK for many years already.  The Minister has said that the purpose of the Bill is to secure the financial future of those who have suffered catastrophic personal injury.  Clearly the idea behind the provisions is to take account of changing needs over time and to guard against what we have seen before with lump sum payments where people have had, for example, poor investment advice and have found then that the money provided for in the lump sum simply was not adequate to meet future needs.  Others have rehearsed the disadvantages of the lump sum payments.  I will not go back over those.  They are set out in the working group report.  I think we are all convinced of the need to allow for these payments to be made and for that reason we all very much welcome the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I note Senator Noone's comments about the definition of catastrophic injury and I was very interested to look at that definition.  Senator Noone is right to say that this is something that deserves very careful consideration.  I know the Minister has said that she and her officials have already given the definition a great deal of attention, and indeed it is difficult to achieve a satisfactory definition, but clearly this sets the definition of catastrophic injury at a very high bar - &quot;a personal injury which is of such severity that it results in a permanent disability to the person requiring the person to receive life-long care and assistance&quot;.  There may well therefore be others who would suffer injuries which we would describe in lay terms as catastrophic but which will not reach that high bar of necessitating life-long care.  Perhaps in future legislation, I wonder if we can look at some way of achieving more flexibility in payment orders in those sorts of cases while acknowledging that clearly there are quite a number of cases, for example, cerebral palsy arising from negligence at birth, where it is clear that they will fit the definition of catastrophic injury provided for in the Bill.  <br\/><br\/>Another issue that Senator Noone raised that I thought was interesting was about the loss of earnings.  This particular provision requires written consent of parties.  I note that is in line with the recommendation of the working group that there would be a consent requirement built in regarding compensation for future loss of earnings, but I would ask whether consideration was given to leaving that out?  Why was that particular recommendation taken on board?<br\/><br\/>Given the long delay that we have had already, will the Minister say when the Bill will be commenced once it is passed?  Is there any particular reason it will require a commencement order rather than coming into force on the day it is passed?  I note that the Minister has said that amendments are being considered in relation to section 51O, which is to be inserted by section 2 and which will provide for the issue of &quot;personal injuries actions relating to catastrophic injuries&quot; and the timing of the application of the Bill.  The new section 51O clearly says that:<\/p><blockquote>This Part applies to personal injuries actions relating to catastrophic injuries&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) that are brought on or after the commencement of section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, or<br \/><br \/>(b) in respect of which no final decision has been made on the date of such commencement.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister has said that she is going to look at amending this section to cover the situation where courts have already made an interim award in anticipation of this legislation coming in.  That is a good idea as there has been much anticipation that this legislation would come in and indeed a lot of court proceedings taken and people having expectations on the basis of that.  I believe that is appropriate.<br\/><br\/>The Minister also said that she will be bringing forward Committee Stage amendments on double recovery of health benefits.  I note that this is also directly related to one of the working group recommendations.  I see that point, but the Minister has said there will also be amendments on open disclosure on patient safety.  Will the Minister say if that is unrelated to the issue of periodic payment orders?  I do not see reference to it in the working group recommendations.  Is it to do with these periodic payments?  Will it have any bearing on those?  Overall, apart from raising a few small queries, like others here, I very much welcome this important Bill and acknowledge the human suffering that has given rise to the need for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#R00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their response to the Bill and the very constructive approach that they have taken.  I think everyone has recognised the importance of this legislation and the difference that it will make in people's lives.  I certainly acknowledge, as a number of Senators including Senator Gavan have pointed out and spoken about, the huge stress that has been caused and is caused to families because of uncertainty around the care of their children or indeed their relatives who have suffered catastrophic injuries.  This has been recommended, as Senator Bacik has said, for quite a long time so I am very pleased that we have it here and I hope that we can work it through the different stages fairly quickly.<\/p> <p>I will be tabling a number of amendments but obviously if there are amendments being proposed that I am in a position to accept I will of course do so.  There were a number of specific points made on the indexation of periodic payments.  Senator Gavan brought that up.  There were various recommendations on how to deal with this.  An interdepartmental working group to examine the technical aspects of periodic payment orders considered it further.  It concluded the most appropriate indexation measure would be the Irish harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, which measures changes in consumer price inflation across the eurozone and aims to be representative of developments in the prices of all goods and services available for purchase.  The interdepartmental group recommended that the effectiveness of that index should be reviewed after five years of operation.  That was to deal with the point that the Senator made about the average hourly rate of pay, for example, for certain persons including nurses, physiotherapists or various people, the average cost of medical procedures for the treatment of persons injured and the estimated average cost for medical aids and appliances.  That is the best recommendation we have in how to deal with this over a long period and with a review built in at the final stage.  <\/p> <p>Senators Noone and Conway both welcomed the Bill.  Senator Noone made a number of points on the scope of the legislation and the boundaries.  Undoubtedly there will be some cases that will fall outside of that definition.  Where there are ongoing costs that is quite a difficult issue to decide on.  The courts will be looking at that definition and determining precisely who falls within it.  We can have a look at that on Committee Stage but I would make the point, and Senator Bacik referenced this, that a lot of work, thought and consultation has gone into it.  It is extremely difficult when one is bringing forward legislation that has to deal with a definition such as this.  I would not be optimistic about changing it because we have done so much consultation on it, but we might be able to examine some pathways forward or issues that need to be addressed in relation to the points Senator Noone has made.<\/p> <p>The Bill is short but the provisions are quite complex.  Before introducing it we had to consider very carefully a number of issues: obviously the scope of the legislation, which is the precise point Senators have raised; the powers that we would grant to the courts in respect of periodic payments; the security of periodic payments; the indexation, a point that was also raised here; the treatment in bankruptcy; and the treatment of periodic payments for income tax purposes.  The point was also made that this is about the consumers.  This is about ensuring that dealing more effectively through the court processes with people who have been catastrophically injured is at the centre of this legislation.<\/p> <p>Again, I thank the Senators.  Everybody has supported the Bill.  There may be some technical points to look at on Committee Stage but I think everyone agrees that it is important legislation to ensure that people will get the care and assistance they need over the course of a lifetime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#S00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486549800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>When it is proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#S00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>On Tuesday, 14 February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#S00500","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486549800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 14 February 2017.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486549800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.29 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1486549800,"counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#CC00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 3<i>a<\/i>, statements on progress on the national children's hospital, be taken on the conclusion of No. 3, with the time allocated to the debate not to exceed 45 minutes.

Local authority elected members are now midway through their first term of serving under the new framework established following the implementation in 2014 of the most radical changes in local government structures for many decades.  These changes include enhanced roles for local authorities in local and community development, the dissolution of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford and the establishment of new merged entities in their place, the replacement of town and borough councils with municipal districts and the reconfiguration of regional structures.<\/p> <p>There was also a series of new governance arrangements, such as an enhanced policy-making role for elected members, new citizen participation measures, local authority service delivery plans, the redesignation of the position of manager to chief executive and stronger oversight powers for elected members in the implementation of policy.  Together, these measures represent significant reform.  Benefits from the measures include efficiency and economies of scale from the local authority amalgamations in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford.  At sub-county level, municipal districts now cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms.  We have removed outdated boundaries and ended the anomaly of small towns having municipal starters and dual representation while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance.<\/p> <p>In July 2015, the Department initiated a review of how the new structures were operating on the basis of the experience to date.  The objective was to consider the operation to date of the revised local government arrangements.  The work included a survey designed to secure the first-hand views of elected members.  It focused mainly on the operation of the new system of municipal districts but also dealt with relevant questions on the operation of plenary councils and councillor workload.  A modified survey was also issued to the six local authorities where no municipal structures were in place.  The surveys issued to all 949 councillors and more than 500 participated.  The results indicated the revised structures are generally operating well but need more time to bed in fully.  Particular concerns were expressed about growing work demands and the increased size of electoral areas, particularly in rural areas where local electoral areas can be very big in terms of the geographical footprint.<\/p> <p>I am fully aware of the extraordinary number of hours given to provide the optimum service to the public at local level.  Serving as an elected member of a local authority is not a job of determinate hours.  Councillors are continuously on-call for their constituents.  The unique nature of their duties also means they incur expenses in their role as public representatives.  As the House is aware, a range of financial supports is already in place to assist councillors in their vital work.  These include a representational payment, fixed annual expenses allowances, travel and subsistence allowances, a mobile phone allowance, a retirement gratuity as well as conference and training provisions.<\/p> <p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to review the supports provided to councillors, involving consultation with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA.  Shortly after taking office last year, I met representatives of AILG and LAMA as well as attending the autumn seminars of both organisations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I listened carefully to the concerns of elected members over the increased workload being experienced.  I also reflected on a range of important issues at stake in this area.  I spoke to quite a number of Members of this House, from all parties, about their concerns in this regard.  Last month, my Department advised local authorities that, in order to support elected members more fully in their public roles, I had decided to alter the arrangements governing elected members' annual expenses allowance.  These changes are a response to the increased workload experienced by elected members arising from the reforms of 2014 and, in particular, to the allocation of new statutory functions in that regard.  Elected members now generally have a broader portfolio of functions and represent larger local electoral areas than before.  There has been a substantial decrease of 41% in the overall number of elected members, from 1,600 to under 1,000, combined with a growing population of constituents to serve.<\/p><p>I intend to make changes on two fronts.  At present, elected members are able to avail themselves of a fixed allowance to cover expenses, other than travel and subsistence, which are reasonably incurred in the discharge of their official functions and duties.  This amounts to between &euro;2,286 and &euro;2,667 per year, depending on the council concerned.  It operates on an unvouched basis.  In future, each elected member may choose to continue receiving the current unvouched fixed allowance at the existing rate or opt to receive a new expenses allowance, which will be up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per year and operate on a fully vouched basis.  The allowable expenditure categories and documentation required of this new vouched system will be aligned, as appropriate, with the arrangements in place for Members of the Oireachtas.  It is envisaged that the following categories of expenses could be claimed for under the new vouched system: leaflets and newspaper distribution; web hosting and other related computer costs; hiring rooms for clinics and other meetings; advertising related to the performance of duties as an elected member; and the purchase of secretarial support.  Fuller details of allowable expenses will be issued in due course.<\/p><p>The second change I have made is to bring in a new municipal district allowance.  The new municipal districts require councillors to service larger local electoral areas than previously was the case.  At the same time, the reductions in overall councillor numbers were concentrated in areas that now have municipal districts.  The 2014 reforms involve the formal assigning of specific statutory functions to be performed by municipal districts themselves.  In recognition of these specific new factors arising from the 2014 reforms, there will be a new municipal district members allowance worth &euro;1,000 per year to apply to the 25 local authorities that now have municipal districts.  I intend that the new arrangements will come into effect from 1 July 2017 following engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and consultation with the Revenue Commissioners and, of course, local authorities.<\/p><p>I am aware there have been calls for an increase in the representational payment that councillors receive.  Since its introduction in January 2002, the payment has been linked to a Senator's salary under the relevant regulations, which provide that when a Senator's salary is altered, the payment also changes by the same proportion.  Elected members benefitted from this link to a Senator's salary over the period 2002 to 2008 when the payment increased by 60%, from &euro;11,000 to &euro;17,604.  The payment was then reduced by &euro;1,039 to its current level of &euro;16,565 over the period 2010 to 2013 in line with the reductions in a Senator's salary under the FEMPI Acts.  Of course, councillors will benefit proportionately from future pay-restoration measures that will increase a Senator's salary.  In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, recently introduced changes to the PRSI status of elected members.  These changes mean councillors, by virtue of their PRSI payments, will now have access to relevant social insurance benefits.<\/p><p>This is an area in which it is very difficult to reach a broadly acceptable solution because different people have different priorities.  Different people structure their local public representation differently.  The voter-councillor ratio is higher in some built-up urban areas than in some rural areas, where there are huge footprints to be covered.  As Senators know, the changes resulted in many more councillors per local electoral area in many cases.  I intend to consider a review of local electoral area boundaries after we have the review of D&aacute;il electoral areas, which will be finished at the start of the summer in a few months' time.  There are issues that we need to consider.<\/p><p>I know there are councillors in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway who, in light of the allowance of &euro;1,000 for all the councillors with a new statutory responsibility for municipal districts and the associated workload, feel somehow left out of that particular element of the reform.  As a Minister, however, I have to ensure taxpayers' money is spent in a way that is transparent and that it is fully accounted for.  I must have clear reasoning as to why we should introduce new allowances.  There is very clear reasoning in regard to the setting up of municipal districts and all that comes from that.  The truth is that, in some of the urban areas, there was far less change in terms of the numbers of councillors representing those areas and the new structures that were necessary to put in place after the abolition of town councils.  I have to be honest about that.  Obviously, it would be more politically acceptable for me to simply grant an allowance for everyone but I have to be accountable for the decisions I make.  I have to go through a process and obtain a series of recommendations that are independently put together based on statutory responsibilities that people have and not based on how hard people work.  I know how hard councillors work.  I was a member of Cork County Council before any of these supports were in place.  Some councillors work extremely hard.  The vast majority do; otherwise they would not stay elected.  Local government is now a very competitive environment.<\/p><p>Not quite, but nearly half of our councillors at local level, are full-time councillors.  It is from this that they drive almost all their income.  It is important for the public to understand that someone who is a full-time local public representative is not paid well.  They choose this because they are seeking to change their local community and improve circumstances for people.  They get a buzz from public representation and politics and it is fair to say they are certainly not in it for the money.  Sometimes they get very bad coverage in respect of the motivation behind the decisions they make.  From my experience with local government, I believe people are sincere, hard-working and operating in a very competitive environment from election to election.  They put very many personal resources into trying to stay elected.  I am happy to make the changes because I do not want circumstances in which people cannot afford to stand for local government.  That is what we are approaching in some cases, which is why it is necessary to consider further support in respect of legitimate expenses incurred by public representatives.  It is also important that there be transparency in this regard, which is why it is very important that expenses be fully vouched and accounted for under the increased package.<\/p><p>I ask Members to work with me.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know that many people in this House are very engaged with local government and with councillors.  Many have come from local government in advance of coming into this House and talk to representative bodies on a regular basis.  Some people are very happy with these changes, some people wanted me to go further and some people feel left out.  Others feel that it has been handled in a fair and transparent way.  There has been no change to the supports for councillors for over 15 years, through very good times and through a very dark period in terms of the Irish economy.  What I am trying to do here is recognise the increased workload that has come from the changes that have been made through that period and recognise the increased statutory responsibilities in law that councillors have to accommodate in their day-to-day lives, particularly around municipal districts, and reflect that in a modest new allowance, and to also recognise the increased professionalism within local government, where a much higher percentage of people now than ever before are full-time councillors.  We need to try and reflect that in the supports that are available in a transparent way for legitimate expenses incurred in the work that they do.  That is my only motivation here and I hope that this House will recognise what we are trying to do here and work with me on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#CC00600","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

We now have 949 councillors, with the loss of 678 councillors.  That is an absolute disaster.

When one looks at the overall issue regarding their payments compared with Northern Ireland and England, Scotland and Wales, there is not the same parity of esteem, to use a term from the peace process, when it comes to public representatives at a local level here.  If we want public representatives to continue in the role across the country then we must ensure that we give them the payments and the supports that will ensure they will be there.

I will keep my remarks to the circular issued by Mr. Gary McGuinn, assistant principal officer, which was circulated to us, which was really the announcement of what the Minister is talking about today.  I want to address a few points the Minister raised in the circular and which he put on the record here today.  I note that the Minister was a county councillor in Cork County Council.  That is one of the councils not affected by the withdrawal or cutback of &euro;1,000.  I will tease that out in a minute.<\/p> <p>The Minister is very aware of the councils and their role and their function, and I want to commend him, as I have done before, on Rebuilding Ireland and his reform of local councils.  However, the Minister's brief is housing, planning, community and local government, and sometimes people forget that.  The Minister is often seen as just the Minister for housing, but we know that he is far bigger than that and that there are many more issues that he wishes to bring before us.  I know how it works, having been a councillor first elected in 1999.  I am not going to give a history lesson on councillors.  We know that there are 949 city and county councillors in Ireland.  We know from independent surveys that they work approximately 44 hours per week.  We know that 40% of the councillors are full time, and their only earned income is their &euro;16,000.  We know that many councillors, particularly women, tell us that they are constantly dipping into the family income, their housekeeping money, to subsidise their work on behalf of their communities.  Councillors are usually the first responders at crises in their own communities, and the Minister knows that.  There are a variety of councillors, be they party councillors or independent councillors working for communities.  <\/p> <p>The reality of the Minister's decision regarding not giving the &euro;1,000 to some councillors will affect 31 Cork city councillors, 18 Galway city councillors, 62 Dublin city councillors, 40 from South County Dublin Council and 40 from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which I have been on for many years.  That is a total of 232 councillors out of 949.  Many of the Senators here today were councillors themselves, so they know and understand how it operates.  I have told the Minister that many young people have told me in the last few months that they are considering leaving local government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are good, young, talented men and women who want to bring something to their communities but simply cannot afford it.  Not all councillors have ambitions to be in the Seanad and not all have ambitions to be in the D&aacute;il.  They are happy, content and fulfilled working for their local communities and we should support them.  Not all of them will be doing newsletters, making circulars, photocopying or all the other things the Minister mentioned regarding expenses.  They are happy to communicate with their little parish, their ward or their community for their betterment.  Councillors want to work with the Minister.  The Minister spoke about boundaries and the reform of local councils and he has a lot of things on his agenda.  He knows what all 31 councils are up to.  I am looking for fair and equal treatment of all councillors in this country and the Minister can deliver that.<\/p><p>I will ask a few things of the Minister.  We do not have to make a decision today and the Minister can go away and think about it.  He has time to reflect on it.  If councillors had fair pay in the first place they would not be coming back to us all the time.  I want fair pay for a fair day's work for county councillors and I want the Minister to look at pay restoration.  I am in receipt of a circular from a senior staff member in his Department who set out the relationship of Deputies, Senators and councillors and how councillors could possibly benefit from pay restoration.  It makes for a sad picture.  In 2008 there were in excess of 17,000 councillors and there are fewer now.  I want the Minister to reconsider the question of doubling the existing fixed allowances.  I acknowledge the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and what he has done in respect of making PRSI more fair and I have no doubt the Minister played a part in it.  Let us have equal, fair treatment of all our councillors.  I ask the Minister to come back to us and we will have opportunities to discuss it in the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#EE01600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the initiative and for acknowledging the presence of the councillors in the Gallery from AILG and LAMA.  This Minister has engaged with representative groups of councillors and with us.  It is the first time in 15 years that we have seen the advancement of the cause of councillors.  Many of us have served on local authorities and recognise the importance of being a councillor.  As Senator Boyhan said, many are happy to have a role developing their city or county and community.  Today's debate is about how we can collectively enhance the supports available to councillors and local authority members.<\/p> <p>The Minister has heard the concerns of the representative groups so I will not articulate them today.

I welcome the announcement by the Minister on the possible change to boundaries in this regard.<\/p> <p>We also need to look at how we can change local government and the Minister spoke about changing the role of the Lord Mayor of Cork City Council.  I will support him in that.  We are working to ensure we can take on board the concerns articulated to us by members of the AILG and LAMA so that the package - the first in 15 years - can be really tangible.  Other Ministers have talked but this Minister is delivering.  It may not be perfect for everybody but there are changes which will be of benefit.  We must ensure, together, that we bring more change and more benefits.  In the cities the workload has increased and the number of meetings have increased.

These should be applied across the board and not just to rural councils.  Being a county or city councillor is more than a full-time job and all we are looking for is equality and fairness across the board.  I was elected to serve the west Mayo area for seven years and covered an area stretching 123 km, requiring a four-hour round trip.  Like many councillors, I worked day and night and tried my best to serve the people who elected me.  The increases of &euro;1,000 in salary and &euro;2,000 in vouched expenses will improve the situation but they must be only a start.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the increased workload of local representatives should be reflected in increased remuneration.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the work done by the AILG and LAMA and their determination to get a fair deal for councillors.  It is important not just to retain local representatives but to make it attractive to those who may consider representing their community's interest in the future, and that includes representation from all walks of life.  People should not be deterred by the low remuneration and barring people with children or with other expenses from being local representatives is not tolerable.<\/p> <p>We have one of the weakest systems of local government and Sinn F&eacute;in would like it to be strengthened.  There are two key deterrents to councillors influencing policy.  One is the imbalance of power between central government and local government, which needs to be seriously addressed.  The other is the imbalance between the chief executive and local representatives.  The chief executives of councils have all the authority and the councillors are left with low remuneration and all the responsibility.  I did a thesis on this issue as part of a master's degree in local government and I would be happy to provide it to the Minister to give him an in-depth analysis of local government in this and in other countries.  The pay of councillors has to be set against the massive salaries paid to CEOs and the upper management of local authorities.  In Dublin the city manager earns &euro;189,000 per year.  How can that be comparable with the remuneration councillors get?  More powers need to be transferred and local representatives rewarded, valued and respected in local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#FF00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>We need to recognise the role of the councillor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#FF00500","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>They provide this public service in an admirable and hard-working manner.<\/p> <p>The councillor is currently undervalued as we have all said.  There is an increased workload on local councillors who are now expected to be available in the community on an almost 24-7 basis, 356 days of the year.  The proposal that rural councillors receive an outright pay increase while their urban-based colleagues receive zero is ludicrously unfair.  There is no justification for it.  The Minister's assertion that it is clear and reasoned is also ludicrous.  Hundreds of councillors and I disagree.  Nobody could support the unfairness, inequality and lack of parity involved.  It would be like me asking Members to support unfair measures in other occupations.  We could not do so in all sincerity.  It even makes less sense not to give the urban councillors of Dublin, Cork and Galway the increase given their higher cost of living, higher rents, parking charges, child care fees and household taxes.  Funds to pay these increases need to be found by Government rather than by local authorities which have been stripped in the time of austerity.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the terms and conditions of our councillors improved.  They provide a vital public service and are at the coal face.  In their own right, they are first responders to the many crises in their communities.

I also welcome the city and county councillors who are in the Gallery.  They do very hard work as the Minister said.<\/p> <p>I have never been a councillor but my experience with them was when I sought election to the House.  It was my first time understanding and realising the fantastic work they do.  I see Councillor Joe Malone in the Gallery.  I got to meet people who worked extremely hard every single day.  I was really amazed by it.  In my work with the RISE Foundation and working with the drugs task force, on which many councillors sit, I see every day the fantastic work they do.  I got a really good understanding of their work.  It is safe to say that no one becomes a city or county councillor for financial reward.  There is no doubt about that.  The rate of pay works out below the minimum wage for most of them when the long hours are taken into account.<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the survey.  I am glad he did because I was struck when I read it by some of the quotes from county councillors in particular.  One woman said it was nearly impossible to be a mother and an elected representative while holding down another job on the payment councillors received.  On my travels, I met a woman who was a county councillor who also had to do nursing at night.  Her husband was ill.  She was an amazing woman.  She really wanted to do the work, but she could not, unfortunately.  This is really important.<\/p> <p>I encourage the Minister to think about the &euro;1,000 allowance and the inequality and unfairness of the fact that Dublin, Cork and Galway city councillors are not getting it.

He brings a good heart and good intentions to this issue.  Reflecting on it and listening to other Members, it appears to me that the ways and means committee might need to do a bit more work on it.  However, it goes in the right direction.  The whole issue of having a fair and equitable system which is seen as such by all involved is critical.<\/p> <p>I focus today more on context, ambition and where things are moving to.  Certainly, there have been many developments over the last number of years.  I note the community development element, the economic side of it and whatever.  That is very important.  We have three Houses of the Oireachtas in the Presidency, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  As such, it is time to have the ambition to see local government and councillors stretching to be involved, while staying rooted in their communities, in whole-of-the-nation issues from a local perspective.  That is important.<\/p> <p>Councillors need resources.  There is an income issue but there is also the issue of resourcing them to be better able to do their work.  I am thinking of one thing in particular.  There are a lot more civil society groups in Ireland today than there were 20, 30 or 50 years ago, including sports clubs, disability groups, local cultural groups, economic groups and farming groups.  Councillors should be able to work in a more consistent and organised way with those groups and bring that thread into it.

I commend the Minister for his work to date.  It must be said that he is the first Minister to make some positive change for councillors, which has to be welcomed.  I welcome broadly the measures that have been brought in already.  All of us who are in regular contact with councillors are aware of their immense dedication and workload.  The reality of councillors' day-to-day lives is that they are on public duty full time and available to all citizens in their areas day and night.  One of my colleagues said earlier that if one were to break down the hourly rate, they would be well below the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>Since the reform of local government structures in 2013 there have been positive changes, but there is no disputing the significant increase in the workload of elected members arising from new structures and legislative obligations.  I will elaborate on these later.  While I have said I welcome these positive moves and I do not want to be overly critical, the most pressing issue is one of equality for all councillors.  That must be addressed as a matter of priority.  While I welcome the &euro;1,000 increase, it is not fair, as other speakers have said, that it has not been extended to councillors in Cork, Galway and four Dublin authorities.  That is a total of 232 councillors.  Like their county council counterparts, they do a tireless job.  However, they are excluded from the municipal districts members' allowance of &euro;1,000.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Inequality, especially when it comes to this positive change, is hard to take for the councillors in question.  To give an example, among the councillors present in the Public Gallery, we have Councillor Geoghegan from Waterford, Councillor Cronnelly from Galway and Councillor Ward from Dublin, only one of whom will not receive the additional allowance despite doing largely the same job.  This is unfair and hard to take, especially for local authority members in Dublin, Galway and Cork. <\/p><p>Another glaring example of inequality is that local authority members are one of the only groups who cannot present a medical certificate to explain absences from work or meetings in their case.  While it is fair enough to require members to attend more than 80% of meetings to receive allowances, there are instances when people cannot attend meetings for reasons of illness, bereavement, maternity or paternity reasons.  I ask the Minister to address this issue because it could be easily changed.  If a councillor is unavailable for work due to illness, bereavement or, most glaringly, maternity reasons, he or she should be allowed to present some form of presentation to excuse an absence.  <\/p><p>As previous speakers noted, the substantial increase in the workload of councillors has been exacerbated by the reduction in the number of councillors from 1,627 to 949.  Many councillors are faced with much larger electoral areas, for example, in west Mayo, west Clare and south-west Kerry, and must provide a service for areas that take a four-hour round trip to cover.  It must also be remembered that councillors in city areas are serving areas with growing populations.<\/p><p>I welcome the positive changes in respect of PRSI and the efforts being made by the Minister who is the first Minister to face up to this issue.  The longer term objective for Senators must be to seek an increase in and realignment of councillors' representational payment to bring it to a realistic level, perhaps to one third of the salary of a Senator, as Senator Wilson stated.  This would reward them for their hard work and commitment.  As previous speakers noted, there is a danger that we will lose great people.  While campaigning in the recent Seanad election, I met councillors who asked what they were doing with their lives and why they were working so hard for so little remuneration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020800002#GG00900","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486549800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the councillors present in the Public Gallery.  I thank councillors from across the country who have contacted me since the circular was issued.  I will try to address a number of specific issues.  On the vouched list, the Minister stated fuller details of allowable expenses would be issued in due course.  I could list items that should be added to this list based on my experience as a public representative for almost 30 years, including 23 years as a councillor.  The current list is very short and not suited to the types of expenses councillors incur daily.<\/p> <p>What is the rationale for excluding city councillors from the proposed measures?  The Minister's argument, which I am sure was presented to him by the officials who drew up the circular, is at best weak and frail.  He indicated that the statutory responsibilities of municipal districts constitute the reason for the proposal to provide an increase for municipal district councillors and not for city councillors.  The latter, whether in Cork, Galway or Dublin, have the same responsibilities as the former, albeit in city hall.  They have the same responsibilities, even if they do not exercise them at a lower level.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on this matter as his argument does not stand up. <\/p> <p>The Minister referred to the review initiated in 2015, during the term of the previous Government.  I was the only Oireachtas Member on the review group, which was top-heavy with officials as opposed to elected representatives.  The only councillor on the group was Councillor Padraig McNally from County Monaghan.  I am disappointed the group did not issue a final report.  The Minister should ensure the group's work is finalised.  One of the facts to emerge from its deliberations, one which was not disputed by the officials on the group, was that councillors worked at least 35 hours per week.  This is a critical issue in any discussion about payment.  The linkage to Senators' remuneration must be removed because it is no longer relevant.  It was established more than 20 years ago when salaries for local authority members were first introduced as a means of comparing the work of councillors with the work of Senators and Deputies.  This approach is no longer relevant because the workload of councillors has increased substantially in the meantime.  Rather than having a link to Senators' pay, the Minister should establish an independent commission of three members to examine local authority members' pay.  It would not have an axe to grind and I am confident that if we allowed the axe to fall - no pun intended - it would result in councillors being paid a proper and fair wage for the work they do on behalf of their communities.  They are not being paid a fair wage and two and a half years into the current term of local government, councillors from all parties are resigning because they cannot make a living or sustain a second job.  Local authority membership has become a full-time job.<\/p> <p>The Minister referred to the review initiated in 2015, during the term of the previous Government.
