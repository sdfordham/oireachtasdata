I meet Prime Minister Cameron regularly in the normal course of events on a bilateral basis and at European Council meetings.  Our recent bilateral discussions have centred on the importance of the UK remaining a member of the European Union.<\/p><p> When I met the Prime Minister on 25 January in Downing Street, the focus then was on the European Council meeting on 18 February this year and the constructive role Ireland could play in the negotiations.  A package of reforms was subsequently agreed by Heads of State and Government which provides a strong basis for the Prime Minister's campaign for the United Kingdom to stay in a reformed European Union.  This, as everybody knows, is clearly of particular importance to Ireland given that our relationship with the UK is closer than with any other EU member state.  The Prime Minister fully recognises our mutual interest in matters relating to Northern Ireland, the importance of a reformed and more effective European Union, the common travel area and our strong economic ties.<\/p> <p> The Irish Government has been very active in our engagement with the UK Government, and with our UK partners, in outlining our concerns and interests in this matter.<\/p> <p> Irish citizens in the UK have a vote in the referendum and it will be important that the Irish Government's position is clearly understood.  In this context, a number of Ministers will make visits to Britain in the coming weeks in cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Glasgow where there are very strong Irish communities, and this week the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will visit Birmingham.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been very actively involved in EU-UK issues both in Britain, in Northern Ireland and in capitals across Europe.  He is in close touch with the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, and met him in London most recently on 5 April.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be in Manchester and Liverpool next week on a programme of meetings and events relating to the UK-EU debate.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is also in touch constantly with political leaders in Northern Ireland, including on the issues that are of concern to us regarding a possible leave vote.  He was in Belfast yesterday and goes to Derry this evening.  Our embassy in London is very active in ensuring that there is awareness of the Government's position, both in the Irish and wider British community.  Our ambassador to the UK gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster on the UK-EU issue.  <\/p> <p> Naturally, the Government is very much aware of the risks associated with a possible overall leave result in the referendum.  Early in 2015, I established a division in my own Department to strengthen our focus not just on North-South relations on the island, but the wider set of relationships that exist between Ireland and Britain, including our interdependent economies and issues that arise in the context of the EU-UK debate.  This unit works closely with the EU division within my Department, which supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union.<\/p> <p> While the Economic Management Council has not and will not be re-established, and therefore has no role in the matter, the Government continues to plan in order to be as prepared as possible and to actively manage any contingencies that may arise.  Departments, agencies and key stakeholders will continue to broaden their analysis of the strategic, policy, operational and sectoral issues that would require priority attention, particularly in the event of a leave vote.  This work is being co-ordinated by my Department.<\/p> <p> There is an established framework for bilateral co-operation and dialogue between the Irish and UK Governments under the joint statement which both I and Prime Minister Cameron signed in 2012.  That framework includes a work programme that is overseen by Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries of Government Departments here and in London.  If the UK votes to leave the EU, it will be more important than ever to have strong bilateral relations and mechanisms by which key policy issues can be addressed.<\/p> <p> With regard to contacts in Northern Ireland since the Assembly elections, I spoke on the phone this morning to the First Minister, Arlene Foster, following her appointment as First Minister.  I congratulated her on her appointment as First Minister and wished her well in forming a new government.  I confirmed that the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting would be held in Dublin next month and that I hoped to make a visit to the North before the summer recess.  First Minister Foster indicated to me that she expects that the difficulty, in so far as the putting together of the Executive is concerned, can hopefully be sorted out today.<\/p> <p> I also spoke to the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, on the phone on 12 May and I congratulated him on his appointment as Deputy First Minister and on his re-election to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I look forward to continuing to work with First Minister Foster and Deputy First Minister McGuinness to meet challenges and develop opportunities to benefit all the communities across the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400003#A02200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464096900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>A Cheann Comhairle, if I may establish some ground rules with your good self, is it your intention that we would respond to the reply and then get an opportunity to ask a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400004#B00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1464096900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>You will get an opportunity to ask a supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400004#B00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1464097500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The problem with having an answer that is too long, arising from having six questions dealing with two different topics, is that it can lead to having a response from our good selves that is also too long.

I have been saying this for five years.  To be fair, some proposals have come from the reform committee relating to this.  It would be preferable to get an understanding from the beginning.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, it is interesting that the Taoiseach referenced the terms of the EU agreement with Britain.  To a large extent, it has almost become irrelevant in the conduct of the campaign, and very quickly the campaign has moved to the fundamentals, which are about Britain staying within the European Union and the economic implications of Britain leaving the European Union for its citizens, with various presentations from the Treasury and so on outlining the level of economic decline that would occur under various scenarios.  So much for all the choreography in advance of the referendum, as much of it has not had an impact on the conduct of the campaign.  I put it to the Taoiseach that part of the issue in the UK is the level of anti-European Union sentiment that has for over 30 years been articulated across Europe, where the EU has served as an all-purpose whipping boy for English nationalists as well as extremists.  That has taken its toll on public opinion.<\/p>  <p>  We must take on board the possibility of the \"Leave\" side winning, although I hope it does not.  Has there been serious scenario planning by the Government and Departments in that context of Britain leaving the EU?  During the talks with Independents we met senior officials in various Departments and I was a bit taken aback with the candid admission that there was no scenario planning as such but the Departments were relying on some papers written by various academics in agriculture and other fields about what might happen if Britain left the European Union.  It is a very serious issue from our perspective.  Will the Taoiseach confirm, one way or the other, if various scenario planning has been undertaken by key economic Departments, including the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to be actioned if Britain takes the decision to leave the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Given the sheer scale of the importance of the issue for Ireland, the D&aacute;il must agree issues in advance.  If the \"Leave\" side wins, we must implement a co-ordinated series of steps to demonstrate that Ireland will respond.  For example, a special sitting of the D&aacute;il would be required, as would a set of formal resolutions by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann setting out Ireland's position on the future of the European Union and relations with the United Kingdom.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that all relevant briefings will be supplied and contingency steps involving D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be discussed and agreed in advance?<\/p>  <p>  There were indications that the Opposition would be invited to participate in events in the UK to discuss the referendum and our view that Britain should remain within the European Union.  This is particularly relevant to the Irish diaspora in the UK and Northern Ireland.  Will the willingness of the Opposition to participate in this be taken on board, as there has been no engagement with the Opposition in this regard?  We have organised our own events, of course, and as I stated, we had a very effective event in Cavan some months ago, where the appalling implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland agriculture were spelled out in no uncertain terms by experts from the agricultural world.  That brings to mind the rather difficult position of the DUP in its ongoing opposition to the European Union and in supporting moves to leave the EU.<\/p><p>I do not know whether the Taoiseach discussed that with the First Minister this morning and whether he raised her opposition to the European Union and her desire for Northern Ireland to leave the European Union.  I suggest that he should have raised it with her and put it to her that this would be a very retrograde step for the all-island economy and particularly for farmers and the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland.  There seems to be very little doubt about that from the expert advice we have received.<\/p> <p> With regard to the two questions about Northern Ireland, there needs to be far greater proactive engagement by the two co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace agreement in general.  There was significant disengagement over the last five years.  That has to stop, and the Governments must assert the duty of the Executive to fully implement the agreements and to end the exclusion of civil society from involvement in meaningful dialogue.<\/p> <p> Now is an opportunity, with the election of the Assembly and the formation of a new Executive, to step back and have a fresh look at the overall situation.  We believe there needs to be a new impetus to energise and expand cross-Border contacts, and we put it into the framework agreement for facilitating this Government.  I ask for a fresh paper to be prepared regarding how we could do that, suggesting the creation of new bodies.  I have long been of the view, for example, that there should be one Enterprise Ireland for the whole island, supporting indigenous enterprise and new start-ups and helping companies that are exporting abroad under the one agency, North and South, a bit like Tourism Ireland.  That is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned, and we should be pushing for that kind of thing in the new situation in the years ahead.  We also need to look at sharing services, as is happening, albeit very slowly, in the health area in regard to the provision of oncology and cancer services for the north west by Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry and the CAWT initiative.  I would appreciate if some new momentum, which is urgently needed, were put into that area of North-South arrangements.<\/p> <p> I also ask the Taoiseach for his views on the fact that parties outside the largest two have clearly had enough of being in an Executive in which basic information is withheld and all decisions are cooked in advance.  They are now looking at a move to a more formal opposition arrangement.  I would appreciate the Taoiseach's views as to whether that will improve the work of the Assembly and Executive alike and the implications he believes it has for the future of the system of government in Northern Ireland at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400005#C00700","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464098100,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will look at the nature of the questions and the way they come in and see whether we can make them more compatible with the views of Deputies opposite, to have them bracketed in a different way.  I agree that Brexit is a one-off and very different issue, but the questions in regard to relations between Britain, Northern Ireland and ourselves are grouped.<\/p>  <p>  The first thing to say is that, as Deputy Martin is well aware, the Government here is absolutely committed to doing everything we can to ensure the Irish vote in Britain votes to stay on 23 June.  That is why I asked all Irish people in Britain yesterday to ensure they are registered by 7 June and to vote to stay in the European Union on 23 June.  It is also important to differentiate, in that while we have almost 1 million people living in Britain, this is a matter for the British electorate, of which the Irish make up almost 1 million.  It is their decision.  No more than Europeans coming over here to tell us what to do with the Lisbon treaty or the Nice treaty or the Maastricht treaty, I am quite sure that people in Britain would not take too kindly to being lectured by others about what they should do.  We have been very careful in what we have done, in talking to Irish communities, Irish councils and any mayors of municipalities or cities who are of Irish descent or have Irish connections.  We want to speak to the Irish communities and to remind them of the importance of the decision they are about to make, both because of the exports of over &euro;1.2 billion that go across the Irish Sea every week and because this is a fundamental decision that must be made.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that Deputy Martin himself may avail of an opportunity that we will make available to go and speak to Irish communities somewhere in Britain on this topic to show there is unanimity from the main parties here about Britain remaining a member of the European Union.<\/p><p>We have already committed ourselves, irrespective of what happens, to staying with Europe, the eurozone and the euro.  However, I do not want to give the impression that a unit within the Department of the Taoiseach is suddenly beavering away as if the outcome of this referendum is known.  It is not known.  In recent days, as Deputy Martin is aware, there has been a strengthening of the position for Britain to stay as a member of the European Union, although I cannot predict, nor can anybody else, what will be the eventual outcome.  It is true to say, and Deputy Martin has put his finger on an important point, that we in this country have been voting on referenda for more than 40 years.  The Irish community generally is aware of the existence of the European Commission, Parliament and the Council, but that is not the case to the same extent in Britain because it has had very few referenda on the question of Europe.  It is of real and the utmost significance that the population be as informed as it can be about the choice to be made.<\/p> <p> Academic papers have been published, of which Deputies are aware.  We would have to think very carefully about what the outcome would be for Ireland if Britain were to vote to leave the EU.  Clearly, the extent to which GDP in this State would drop, the increase in costs for exporters and currency fluctuations are unknown.  If the UK were to leave the EU, there would be negotiations about the consequences of the exit for at least two years and beyond.  I do not want to give the impression that the Irish Government has been focusing entirely on a result that we do not know about.  We have been focused, with the British Government, its Ministers and with businesses, on saying that it is really important to make the decision to stay.<\/p> <p> With regard to Northern Ireland, I did not discuss the situation with First Minister Arlene Foster this morning.  We will hold a meeting on 10 June in Dublin and the issue will more than likely be raised then.  I take the point about single bodies for, maybe, a different move here.  These meetings, as the Deputy knows, can become quite staid after a number of years, and while the issues are important, there is always movement in between.  I recall after the 1996 Canary Wharf bombing that we were to attend the big tourism show in Earl's Court and people suggested that the trip be called off altogether.  Instead, we put the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the former Bord F&aacute;ilte onto the one stand, and for the first time ever, Irish people from the island of Ireland were able to promote the tourism facilities North and South from the one exhibition stand.  Out of that came an understanding that this was one area where there should not be disagreement.  If we consider the support from the Government through F&aacute;ilte Ireland for what is now the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, which was held in Northern Ireland, it can be seen that we provide such support as necessary throughout the country.<\/p> <p> In respect of the issue raised about Stormont, I spoke to the First Minister this morning.  She believes that while there was a method by which the Alliance Party held the Justice portfolio in the Executive, the Alliance Party made particular demands of both parties in the Executive that they were not prepared to concede.  My understanding, from speaking to the First Minister today, is that they will be able to arrive at a conclusion to this today.  Otherwise, under the law, another election will be triggered because of the failure to meet the d'Hondt requirement.  Moving away from power sharing is a move towards more normalised government because there is a majority between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP against other parties.  If that is the wish of the SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance Party and so on, that is their wish as elected Members.  It means that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly will be able to function and get on with the business of the devolved powers and authority given to it following Stormont.<\/p> <p> The Deputy raises the point often about the failure to engage regularly with Northern Ireland.  We have been very busy with it, and in defence of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, he was there for ten weeks in a row working on the Stormont House Agreement.  There is a great deal of activity going on and I would be happy to talk to the Deputy about that.  If he feels there are other areas where we could evolve some of the companies and some of the cross-Border issues, I would be happy to consider that.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, we continue to support some of the infrastructure in the North for access to the north west and there is a sharing of that effort.<\/p> <p> These are issues that are all now dependent on what happens on 23 June.  For our part, we have made it perfectly clear that we want to work with the British Government, the British people and British business.  I commend Michael O'Leary and others who have spoken out about the disastrous consequences for business, jobs and Irish jobs were the British electorate to vote to leave the European Union.  It is a big decision, but it is their decision.  However, within that group of people, we have almost 1 million Irish people who are entitled to vote on this issue and we want them to vote for Britain to stay as a member of the European Union.<\/p> <p> We have had a common travel area since 1922.  We do not want that to be in any way disrupted.  It allows for travel north, south, east and west on a regular basis as needs be.  There are, of course, other implications, which the British Government well understands, concerning the social benefits of Irish participation and our working in Britain over many years.  These are all issues of concern to us.  If, at the end of the day, the British electorate were to decide to leave, we will have to deal with the consequences.  While some preparatory analysis has been considered, the vast majority of our emphasis has been to work with the British Government, British business and the British people to say how important it is that Europe would be a stronger union with Britain as a central member and that Ireland, as a consequence, would be able to continue to maintain our jobs and association with British business across the water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400006#D00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464099300,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I also want to make the point that the grouping of these issues is not the way for us to get the maximum information on them.  The Taoiseach will recall that I argued during the last Government that we should set aside dedicated time every month to deal with the North.  We should not just be dealing with it in the middle of a crisis or when some other difficulty arises.  I thought we had that understanding, so I would ask the Taoiseach again to reflect on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I want to concentrate my remarks on the North but I will make a few broad remarks on the issue of Brexit.  Our problem, to which the Taoiseach referred, is not that the people of Britain would decide to leave the EU.  Of course, we have a self-interest and there would be a negative effect upon fortunes in this State.  However, our problem is that the North would be dragged with them, which would, because of partition, create particular difficulties.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees - he has had occasional forays north - that the physical border is all but invisible.  None of us downplay the unfinished business that has to be done to remove the economic and political barriers and deal with the legacy issues, but a return to Border controls would be a very negative and retrograde step.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, we are organising a conference early in June on Brexit.  Business people and those in the councils and chambers of commerce on both sides of the Border want maximum co-operation and are trying to find ways to develop it.  The economic and social impact of Brexit along the Border counties would be substantial.  It would also be significant on this State, not least in our agricultural industry but in a whole range of other social and economic matters.  Further, it would  have an adverse effect on the all-Ireland bodies that are part of the Good Friday Agreement.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has had the opportunity to raise these matters with the British Prime Minister and if the Taoiseach has asked him about any of those issues.<\/p>  <p>  I spent most of yesterday afternoon in Stormont and I can tell the Taoiseach that I am very confident that the Executive will be elected tomorrow.  In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in will be announcing our nominees for ministerial positions later on today.  The Taoiseach will recall that it was agreed during the Fresh Start negotiations that arrangements would be put in place to facilitate the creation of an opposition in the Assembly.<\/p><p>The SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party have decided to do precisely this, and that is a matter entirely for themselves.  It is a pity they did not tell the voters this during the election.  We recall that the UUP and the SDLP were two lead parties in the Northern Ireland Government for nine years and they made a mess of it.  The political institutions were suspended twice, they crashed twice and they were down for almost five years during that nine-year period.  Sinn F&eacute;in did not walk away during any of these shenanigans.  Instead, we faced up to the challenges.<\/p> <p> I am a united Irelander.  Sinn F&eacute;in is a progressive republican party.  We want to see all-Ireland governance, but the imperative at the moment is to build partnership, get to know our neighbours, try to remove divisions and try to move forward and deliver in difficult circumstances for the people in the North and throughout the island.  Let us see how all of that develops.<\/p> <p> Sometimes a mistake is made in this Chamber whereby the Government's role is defined as having to give support to people in the North.  Of course that is part of it and no sensible person would repudiate that.  Anyone who is progressive would welcome a greater involvement by the Irish Government in all of these issues in a strategic and sustainable way.  However, as I have said many times, the big job of the Irish Government is to engage with the British Government.  Its job is certainly to engage with our neighbours in the North in an ongoing and almost invisible way.  It should be just as easy as breathing to be dealing with people in that part of the island.  However, the Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty.  There is a responsibility and obligation on the Government as co-equal guarantor of the Agreement to keep the British Government to account.  It would be useful if our Government was a united Ireland government.  I know that is the historical antecedent of the Fine Gael Party.  The British Government is a Unionist Government, and it makes no bones about that.  However, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement there is no legal, unconditional commitment to the union.  In fact, it can be changed if a majority in the North vote for change.  I believe that is what our Government should be doing on bread-and-butter issues, economic issues, legacy issues and all of the social and economic issues as well as on that major issue.  Clearly, 100 years on, partition does not work.  Whatever merit it had for the elites back in the day when it was imposed on us, now the North does not have the same importance in the context of the British State as an industrial hinterland and so on.  I commend that approach to the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> Another specific issue that is the British Government has stated it will scrap the UK's Human Rights Act 1998.  This is a crucial point.  This threat was contained in the Conservative Party manifesto last year.  The Act is a central part of the legislation for the Good Friday Agreement.  Human rights activists are deeply concerned about the current status of this threat.  A consultation was to be held, but it has not been authorised and has not happened.  There has been a range of incoherent and flawed arguments from the British Government in support of its position.  Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement the British Government is obliged to \"complete incorporation into Northern Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights\".  The Human Rights Act gives legal effect to the convention.  I am raising this as an issue of grave concern.  What is the Taoiseach's up-to-date understanding of this?  When was the last time he spoke to Mr. Cameron about it?  If he has not done so recently, will he do so and report back to the D&aacute;il at the earliest opportunity?  In a sentence, what we need from our Government is consistent strategic engagement with the British Government in all of these issues.<\/p><p>We need quiet diplomacy and because it is an international agreement we ask the Taoiseach to look to our friends in the international community for their support in the implementation of this agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400008#F00200","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464099900,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will be very happy to raise the matter again with the British Prime Minister and report back to the D&aacute;il on the human rights issue.  Our justice committee will be known as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Human Rights.  It is an issue of considerable importance to us.  I will advise the House on the points the Deputy has raised about the Human Rights Act 1998 in the Conservative Party policy document.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a debate here tomorrow on the cross-party motion on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and we continue to press the British Government for access to papers that have not been provided for all of these years.  Deputy Adams is aware that a couple of years back, when we brought the relatives of the victims and the sole survivor of the Kingsmill killing here, I committed to making available any information about that on Garda files.  It took quite a long time to get that through because of legal complications and so on, but that information was transmitted by the Garda personally to the Coroner&rsquo;s office and is now part of that inquest, investigation and analysis.  I have not seen the evidence and do not know whether it will add one way or another to the findings but it was an important signal to the British Government that the Irish Government was prepared to make available documentation hitherto unknown in that respect.  It is important to say that we all recognise that the Republic is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and that was repeated time and again in respect of the agreements in between, most recently the Stormont Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  There are differing views of the Brexit referendum in Britain.  Some people say we should be negotiating a better deal.  Some say if they vote to leave they will have to give a better deal afterwards.  The legislation here is very clear, and the agreement was very clear, that this is a one off and if the British people decide to stay, the changes, opportunities and propositions agreed at the European Council will take immediate effect.  If they decide to leave, there will be a minimum of two years&rsquo; negotiation.  Deputy Adams may have referred somewhat obliquely to the point that while the Irish Government in a European context would continue to strongly support the value of Britain being a member of the European Union and would argue for that because it is a stronger union with Britain in it, we have no idea what the attitude of European countries would be towards Britain were it to decide to leave because they have had agreements with it since the 1970s and everybody could argue their case up and down.  I could not speak for what any other country&rsquo;s attitude might be towards Britain were the British electorate to decide to leave.  Our view would be that the Union would continue to be a stronger union were Britain to continue to remain a member but I could not speak for other countries.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the cross-Border facilities, we agree with the Deputy and have raised it with the Deputy First Minister on many occasions.  The opportunity for us here over the past few years was not great, given the financial straitjacket the country was in, to assist in respect of the North-South infrastructure projects.  Between now and 2020 almost &euro;3 billion will be made available by the European Union towards Northern Ireland for the Peace and INTERREG facilities.  People often forget that.  They might have a different view of the scale of moneys being made available by the US through the American fund but there is &euro;3 billion available over the next four years for Northern Ireland under the Peace and the INTERREG facilities.  That is an important consideration given that Northern Ireland is an area coming out of conflict.<\/p><p>We have more peace walls than we have had for many years and there are still very fragile communities, particularly among young people who experience difficulties.  That is why the PEACE and INTERREG funds were important in the considerations of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which we held in the first half of 2013, in negotiating the moneys concerned. <\/p> <p> It is true that, as Deputy Adams is well aware, if Britain decides to leave the European Union, Northern Ireland would be the most adversely affected region.  Ireland would be the country most affected, but Northern Ireland would be particularly severely hit.  Every party has to make up its mind.  The DUP has given its view on why it believes Britain should leave.  I am glad other parties have a different view.  <\/p> <p> As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin pointed out, there are possibilities for economic entities on the island of Ireland which could offer enhanced opportunities.  First and Deputy First Ministers were made welcome in Brussels when we held the Presidency.  They were introduced to trade delegations that were coming to Ireland or that we met abroad while promoting the island of Ireland, without any difference of opinion with regard to the companies being pursued by the First and Deputy First Ministers to obtain investment and create jobs in Northern Ireland.  I hope we will be able to continue that.<\/p> <p> It is 24 May.  In less than a month, one of the most momentous decisions of the past 50 years will be made, namely, whether Britain continues to remain a strong and central member of the European Union.  I hope it does.  Between now and then we will do everything we can to encourage Irish people in Britain to vote to stay.  If, by implication or information, the broader electorate have a view on that, I hope it will be a strong result in favour of Britain's remaining as a member of the European Union.<\/p> <p> I will advise the House in respect of the human rights issue at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400010#H00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464100200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I will take two quick supplementary questions from Deputies Martin and Adams.

However, costings prepared by my Department in 2015 as part of its review of the first 12 months of operation of the regulations demonstrate that the new assigned certifier role can be achieved for approximately &euro;3,800 per dwelling.  Economies of scale mean the cost per unit will be considerably lower for multi-unit developments.  Where additional design work is required, the combined cost for design and assigned certifier duties for a single dwelling is approximately &euro;6,000.  A number of respondents at public consultation have confirmed that assigned certifier services can be secured in line with the Department&rsquo;s costings.

I ask the Minister to consider a certification and licensing regime that could be managed by local authorities.  In that way, people could obtain the relevant qualifications and expertise, thus having a licensing and certification system in place to do a job as effectively, if not more effectively than would otherwise be the case.  Ultimately, we could resource local authorities so that they would be the sole certifiers.

In<b><\/b>November 2015, Dublin City Council entered into a contract for the delivery of the 22 units in Ballymun at a cost of &euro;4.2 million excluding VAT.  This is the original tender cost and remains the approved cost, equating to approximately &euro;191,000, excluding VAT per unit.  I understand that final accounts between the council and the provider are pending.  The 22 units have been completed and are being occupied.  The average cost of these units must be considered in the context of their early delivery and the quality involved.  It is highly unlikely that purchasing properties on the open market could have delivered sufficient quantities of such high quality units in suitable locations in such a short period, given the timescales inherent in surveying and conveyance requirements which would attach to each individual property.  It must also be borne in mind, in terms of making cost comparisons, that many units purchased on the open market, particularly second-hand units, would require further expenditure in respect of renovations that may be required to bring them up to standard.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, the acquisition of units on the open market remains an important part of the overall social housing programme.

One of the concerns many of us had when the rapid builds were first announced related to cost.  My party is not against them on principle.  If they get families out of inadequate and cramped emergency and hotel accommodation for short-term stays before they move on to long-term housing, they could have a role to play in tackling the emergency.  The difficulty, however, is on the basis of the full cost the Minister has outlined, the unit cost will be approximately of &euro;210,000.  As RTE revealed in a \"Prime Time\" special, there is a potential additional cost of &euro;500,000.  Correspondence was exchanged between Dublin City Council and the Department, albeit before the Minister took office, regarding additional costs fro the 22 units in Poppintree.  The city council will not comment on this but our concern is whether this is an additional cost that may also have to be factored into rapid builds elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  We are also concerned that given that many families remain in emergency accommodation, for example, in Dublin city for more than 18 months or in my own constituency in the South Dublin City Council area for more than 12 months, they may not be short stays.  Can the Minister give us an assurance if he proposes an increase in the number of rapid builds, that there will be a significant reduction in the cost of the first tranche and that he will also do everything in his power to ensure people are accommodated on the basis of an emergency stay only and the units do not become long-term housing by another means?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400015#N00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1464102000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Sometimes there is a misunderstanding regarding the difference between rapid-build technologies and engineering solutions and modular housing units as if we are somehow building the trailers parks of the future.

A strategic decision was taken at some point to construct rapid-build units instead of using modular housing units which would perhaps be more temporary.<\/p><p>Timber-frame house building was frowned upon and questioned 15 years ago, but has subsequently become the norm for many people.  My understanding is that the houses in Ballymun have a life expectancy of 60 years, so this should not simply be temporary accommodation.

It was estimated that one-off costs for staff redundancies, termination of contracts, transitioning to another model and so on could range between &euro;85 million and &euro;169 million.  In addition, some &euro;1.6 billion additional running and capital costs would arise over the period of the current Irish Water business plan to 2021 due to the fact that the efficiencies agreed in the context of that plan would be unlikely to be achieved in a return to a local authority model.  From memory, the efficiencies planned for in the business plan over that period were &euro;1.1 billion.

They are rapid build houses that look, feel and behave as would a normal modern house.

It is committing to building more than 20,000 housing units and will be central to projects like the new special development zone, SDZ, at the Irish Glass Bottle site and other sites.  I have met representatives of NAMA and have made it very clear that I want the agency to work with local authorities to make properties available for social housing.

I want to emphasise to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, as the new Ministers responsible for this area, that time is crucial in terms of the intervention and trying to ensure a solution is found for those home owners.  Already a number of the home owners involved have taken measures to take down the outer leaf of the home affected, leaving the inner wall and rebuilding the outer wall.  If it is caught early enough, and the expert panel will have to report on this, there is a feeling that this remedy may ensure there is a long-term solution available to homes.  However, if it gets to the stage where the inner leaf of the wall is also affected, then obviously the whole house may not be salvageable.  It is crucial that we act quickly once the panel reports.

They are saying intimidation is rife across the community and that young people are getting up to &euro;200 for the distribution of tablets, which is now the main drug form in the area in terms of various medicines and so on.  The incentives for young people to get involved in this drug trade are enormous and it is very challenging for other young people to combat that and to send them in a different direction.  There is a fundamental disregard for human life and for our community.<\/p>  <p>  These groups are saying to us that they feel the supports that were put in from the late 1990s onwards have been eroded over the past number of years.

I met with the Garda Commissioner along with senior Garda personnel and the Minister for Justice and Equality quite recently.  I asked the direct question: \"Are you having sufficient resources made available to you to do the job that you need to do?\"  I think that Deputies might not fully appreciate the scale of personnel involved in this kind of activity from a Garda resources point of view.  I was assured, as was the Minister for Justice and Equality, that the resources and facilities are being made available to garda&iacute; which they require to do the job.  The Minister also met with people last week and very major investigations are ongoing since the Regency Hotel murder.  The painstaking work that has to be done by the garda&iacute; and by intelligence personnel is painstaking and very labour intensive and that point was made to me.  Over the years gangland criminals have become more sophisticated in the way they communicate but not so much in the way they deliver their death warrants which is still by guns and bullets and at times entry to locations where indiscriminate shooting takes place.<\/p> <p> There has been absolutely no scaling back with regard to the operations or resources available to the Commissioner and the garda&iacute; to do this job.

Something had to happen - and it did happen - in Limerick to elicit an above normal response.  One needs a consistent and sustained multi-agency approach to this issue from the bottom up.  Community supports need to be put in place, education supports need to be put in place along with stronger out of the norm employment supports for the medium and longer term issues.

No Government should admit defeat by these criminal gangs, and there is an obligation on Government to do everything it possibly can across the board, involving an inter-agency response, to stop these murders and put an end to them.  Governments should be clear and determined in the message going out to these groups that this will stop.<\/p>  <p>  Part of this is the need for legislation to criminalise the sale of prescription drugs.  This is an issue the Garda has raised in the north inner city area, where young children are now distributing tablets and so on.  There is an issue around that legally.  Whatever issues are there should be dealt with in legislation as a matter of urgency, because this has been going on for quite some time, apparently.

This represents a 90% increase from this time last year.  The inaction in recent years has given rise to this crisis.  Everyone in the House is now agreed that this is completely unacceptable.  A total of &euro;45 million will be spent in 2016 on emergency hotel accommodation.  Children are spending years of their childhood in hotel rooms in this city.

Yet, essentially, despite what the Taoiseach said earlier, the HSE is still applying an embargo on staff recruitment.  There is an estimated shortage of 3,600 nurses and midwives throughout the country's hospitals.  The health service and hospitals are already operating under severe strain due to the lack of staffing.  The embargo is making an intolerable situation utterly impossible.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the position in terms of the programme for Government's commitment to implement new procedures to ensure more efficient and timely recruitment of nurses?  This needs to be accelerated, especially in Drogheda, where the hospital is short 100 staff.

Grace, as the Taoiseach will recollect, was the young woman with intellectual disabilities who remained in a foster home at the centre of abuse allegations.  We are waiting for terms of reference for the commission of investigation into this case.  I am led to understand that the Cabinet was expected to get an update on this case two weeks ago from the Attorney General.  Was that briefing provided?

In February, a HSE report revealed that 2,700 citizens aged over 75 years had spent more than 24 hours on trolleys, and yesterday there were 257 patients on trolleys.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, in my constituency, had the highest number of patients on trolleys in the State.  Today, nursing and midwifery staff in that hospital are undertaking a work to rule to protest at the vacant 104 whole time equivalent posts that urgently need to be filled.  In response to another question, the Taoiseach denied that a moratorium was in place.  He then went on to say that if the hospital has the resources it can recruit.  If the Government does not give the hospital the resources then it cannot recruit.  When will the hospital bed capacity review commence?  When will it conclude?  How does the Government expect to reach the target set in the programme for Government for a reduction in emergency department waiting times if it cannot fill the jobs that are vacant and is imposing a moratorium on new jobs?  There are 104 vacant posts in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400024#W01200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1464107100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We have not had a briefing on the young woman named Grace from the Attorney General.

The Taoiseach is aware that it has been three years since the mobility allowance was stopped.  The Ombudsman decided that the scheme should be broadened, but instead the Government stopped it and set up a committee.  Last week the T&aacute;naiste, in reply to Deputy Adams, said the matter was being worked on in the Department of Health.  Strangely enough, about four months after the mobility allowance scheme ceased, I had a similar query and received precisely the same answer, namely, that the Department of Health was working on the issue.

I wished to speak on the issue on the previous occasion when such a debate was held in the House but, unfortunately, I had a foot injury.  Mental health is a great concern for all of us.  Our society has become more complex, our purpose less clear and the route our lives will take, less certain.  The strain of the multitude of tasks we perform on a daily basis and the ever-increasing fast pace of the world we live in can place greater stress on all of us.  Depression and mental illness can transform the beauty of a bright and beautiful May day such as today and a world with promise into a place of dread and worthlessness.  Those days, when life has to be endured and where it all seems like a pointless crawl towards old age, are a burden many with depression and mental illness face on a daily basis.  Even those of us with good mental health know painful times, days where life seems to be without meaning and pain and disappointment are very present.  Those times, however, give us an opportunity to show empathy with those who suffer with bad mental health.<\/p>  <p>  Understandably, there has been much focus on the mental health budget in recent times.  Since 2012, we have provided for continued spending on mental health.  We must remember that the national debt, which increased from &euro;47 billion in 2007 to &euro;189 billion in 2011, the year Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party left Government, is a reality with which mental health funding strategists will have to grapple for decades.  I want to be part of a Government that will be able to better resource mental health in the years ahead.  We are doing that incrementally.  The gross non-capital mental health budget has increased from &euro;711 million in 2012 to &euro;791 million in 2016.<\/p><p>While there is and always will be much work to do in the field of mental health, one also should take stock of the improvements that have been made in this vital area.  The era of large, fully operational industrial-sized psychiatric hospitals in places such as Ballinasloe and Portrane is gone.  If one remembers the year 1963, when President Kennedy visited Ireland, more than 19,000 people, or 0.7% of the national population, were in psychiatric institutions, more than half of whom had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  The transition of St. Brendan's psychiatric hospital at Grangegorman from a dreary hidden complex with more than 2,000 patients at its peak to what is now a vibrant new campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology reflects our commitment to change.  There was a time, not so long ago, when depression and mental illness were shameful hidden taboo subjects, but this no longer is the case.  Even though society has become more complex, it also, quite rightly, has become less judgmental of people.  The Mental Health Act 2001 puts on a statutory footing the rights of users of psychiatric hospitals and sets out clearly their right to a decent standard of care in their best interests and with a view to reviewing involuntary detention.  Ireland has moved into a new era of mental health and, with this Act, psychiatric patients are better protected, with a robust charter of rights.<\/p> <p> As a people, we must reach out to our brothers and sisters in their despair while acknowledging their pain and showing solidarity.  As a mediator and family lawyer, I have seen how depression can engulf a family, particularly one-parent families with mental health concerns, and children are particularly vulnerable in such circumstances.  Funding for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, is a priority.  I am happy to note there have been improvements in this vital area for young people who are affected by mental illness.  The number of people waiting more than 12 months for treatment from December 2014 to April 2015 has decreased by 60% under the CAMHS waiting list initiative.  Moreover, an additional eight CAMHS beds were added with the opening of the Linn Dara facility in December 2015, which increases the number of CAMHS beds to 66.  While these are modest achievements, they were made at a time of unparalleled economic adjustment.  This is an acute area in which improvements will be made, and the urgency of doing this must be informed by the suicide rate in Ireland among 15 to 19-year-olds, which, frighteningly, is the fourth highest among 31 European countries surveyed.  This must be taken into account.<\/p> <p> The new programme for Government sets out an ambitious strategy on mental health and the Government is committed to meeting the recommendations set out in the strategy A Vision for Change.  As Members are aware, this strategy sets out wide-ranging recommendations, including improved communications for continuity of care, referral protocols, direct access to diagnostic facilities, discharge plans, integrated pathways and shared care arrangements.  Since early 2015, clinical nurse specialists in psychiatry have started work in emergency departments to provide a rapid response to those who present with self-harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400026#Y04000","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy sharing time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I am unsure whether Deputy D'Arcy is in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Deputy D'Arcy is present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":321,"content":"<p>As he is, I will conclude.

In 2007, on the basis of implementing A Vision for Change, all Oireachtas Members from County Wexford were the first to agree to close what was the old system, namely, St. Senan's Hospital, which went back to the Victorian tradition of institutionalising people.  The services were placed within the community and throughout the county.  Carn House, Tara House, Summerhill, Ard Aobhinn and Maryville House have provided good services and, based on my interaction with clients, staff and those who are providing the services, people can only say good things about it.  There is an area where is inadequacy - namely, in respect of acute admissions.  On the basis of A Vision for Change, it was agreed within County Wexford that there would be admissions in Newcastle, County Wicklow, for people from north County Wexford and in a facility at Waterford General Hospital for those in south County Wexford.  I and some other colleagues who stood in the general election gave an undertaking to do all we could to ensure there would be an acute admission facility in County Wexford, where it is required.  County Wexford is one of the largest counties and a need exists there which must be met.<\/p>  <p>  However, the area in which major pressures exist is in respect of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  These are new pressures in new areas in which the services are merely catching up.  Social media are having a hugely negative impact on some children and adolescents, and much research is required in this regard to try to ascertain the impact it is having.  I commend the voluntary associations within my county, such as Talk to Tom and It's Good 2 Talk, to name just two, as well as others.  A national group, Cycle Against Suicide, should be commended on bringing awareness to the issue of mental health and bringing into the open that it is not the stigma it once was.  We used to call St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy \"the Redbrick,\" which only had a negative connotation about what would happen when one went to that hospital.  However, I do not believe we are discussing mental health issues with children sufficiently early.  I read research last week about social media and the amount of time children spend in front of a screen or a tablet of some nature.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to touch on the issue of CAMHS in County Wexford, where the accommodation is completely inadequate.  The HSE is renting facilities in Enniscorthy and has some facilities in Slaney House.  However, there is nothing in Gorey town or district and nothing in the town and district of New Ross.  Moreover, there is no out-of-hours service for CAMHS in the county, and it appears to be nearly impossible to recruit a CAMHS consultant psychiatrist.  There are three vacant posts in Counties Wexford and Waterford.  There is an issue in this regard and Members might as well face up to it.  I spoke to a consultant last week who complained about his net pay, rather than his gross pay, because he was paying tax at a rate of 58% between USC, the pension levy and everything else.  He told me he would be there for a little while but would leave because he did not intend to pay tax at a rate of 58%.  Unfortunately, too many children and adolescents are paying the price because it is not possible to recruit.  This is a problem that exists across the entire health service.  In addition, I refer to the services for those with complex needs.  In the past, these complex needs were served by locking up such people.  That is not the answer.<\/p>  <p>  While I would like to speak for longer, my time is up and I do not wish to eat into the time of the next speaker.  However, Members should have a mental health debate on the complex needs of a small minority.  We should be more detailed and more structured in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I now call on Deputy James Browne, after whom the next speaker from Fianna F&aacute;il will take the following slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1464108900,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On average, two people per day are taking their own lives at present.  This means two families and two groups of friends are devastated on a daily basis, and these are merely the deaths one can be certain are suicides.  The issue of mental health and mental well-being affects everybody, including children, young people and the elderly, and it affects people in towns, rural areas and cities.  In making mental health a front-bench portfolio, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Fianna F&aacute;il are setting out clearly the priority this issue is for our party.  As part of the agreement to support the minority Government, Fianna F&aacute;il made it a critical point that the strategy, A Vision for Change, would be implemented fully, and the party expects this to happen.  This means placing in our community the necessary supports to provide effective early interventions, support networks and a recovery model for those suffering from mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  One must treat the head and the heart with equal respect.  A person who presents with a broken arm is not turned away, and someone who has the courage to speak out about his or her mental health should be given equally urgent care.  To date, the Health Service Executive has been practising what effectively is graveside medicine in respect of mental health, and this must end.  People with mental health issues are being treated inhumanely and families are suffering when simple early intervention could allow people to live full and amazing lives.<\/p><p>We need to see a community recovery model that allows people who suffer from mental health issues to receive treatment among their own in order that they can retain a sense of connectedness to their community.<br\/><br\/>In this time of modern communications we have never had as many close and personal friends.  Some people have up to 4,000 or 5,000 close and personal friends on their Facebook pages, yet the daily interaction between people has almost been lost.  For a farmer living in rural Ireland today, his hardware store has probably gone, along with the garda station, post office and school.  The postman leaves letters in a green box at the end of the laneway and even the milk collector tends to come in the middle of the night.  Farmers can go days without making contact with anybody.<br\/><br\/>Ten, 20 or 30 years ago, when young people were growing up the only people they were trying to compete with were those in their classroom.  Now, however, they are trying to compete with others across the world because they can see what everybody is up to on Facebook.  <br\/><br\/>We need to increase awareness of mental health problems and end the stigma concerning them to allow and encourage people to break their silence on the issue.  That means giving people the confidence that if they break their silence they will get the supports they need within the community.<br\/><br\/>I support the closure, under<i><\/i>A Vision for Change, of those old institutions.  In the 1948 to 1949 period, almost one in 50 people was in an institution, but thankfully those days are long behind us.  Part of the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for closing those institutions was a buy-in by service users who were promised that community care would be there for those requiring mental health treatment.  That has not been delivered, however, nor anything close to it.  Much of that care work has been supplemented by voluntary groups, such as Cycle Against Suicide, Talk to Tom and others, but they need co-ordinated support at national level.<br\/><br\/>Suicide is now the leading cause of death among young people.  In 2013-14, suicide among women increased by 14.7%.  That was mostly women in their 20s, yet we lack research on how to prevent suicide.  Only a few weeks ago, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, performed liposuction on the &euro;35 million additional moneys provided for the mental health budget.  He took &euro;12 million out when more funding is needed.  That was reprehensible.<br\/><br\/>The other day a young mother rang me to say that her almost five year old child who had experienced trauma has been awaiting an assessment for nearly two years.  When some young people finally receive an assessment they are told that they are too old and no longer meet the criteria for treatment.  They are then put onto other waiting lists and such people are constantly being shuffled around.<br\/><br\/>I urge the new Minister, Deputy Harris, to treat mental health as a crisis.  He should establish a national mental health authority, similar in format to the Road Safety Authority.  When road traffic deaths were increasing annually, we set up that authority which is independent of the Government.  It was allowed to challenge the Government on policy setting and implementation.  We need a similar body to tackle the prevailing mental health crisis.<br\/><br\/>I also urge the Minister to take on the vortex of inertia in the HSE, although I realise that will not be easy.  I have dealt with the HSE and there are many good people in it, but there also seems to be a lot of paper shuffling and a lack of responsibility there.  People suffering with mental health issues do not want any more tea and sympathy.  Last Friday, Mr. Vincent Browne from Cycle Against Suicide told a public meeting on mental health in Wexford that they do not need any more mothering and apple pie.<br\/><br\/>The cause of mental health has been advanced to the point where it is being publicly discussed.  Everybody supports more care for mental health, but they need funding and action.  If the Minister takes action we will support him because he has a tough job on his hands.  He must treat mental health as a priority and put it on an equal footing with physical health.  If he fails, however, we will be relentless in our criticism.  It will be the duty of every Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Member, including myself as spokesperson on mental health, to raise that issue.  When Deputy Thomas Byrne from Meath speaks on education, he will raise mental health.  When Deputy McConalogue speaks on agriculture, he will also raise mental health issues.  When our spokesperson on disabilities, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, contributes to debates, she will also raise mental health, as will Senator Catherine Ardagh, our party leader in the Seanad.<br\/><br\/>Mental health will no longer reside in the shadows, nor should it.  We will be at the forefront of keeping it as a priority issue in this Chamber.  I therefore call on the Minister to place mental health on an equal footing with physical health.  He must fully implement A Vision for Change and develop a follow-on programme.  A Vision for Change is now ten years old, but a follow-on programme should not be used as an excuse to park that policy which needs to be fully implemented.  We also need to establish a policy group owned by the service users.  It should not be a top-down policy, dictated to those with needs, but rather a policy that involves talking to people on the ground.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister to restore the &euro;12 million cut in funding and ensure the money is spent.  We have had endless announcements of mental health funding, but it is always left unspent and is then used elsewhere.<br\/><br\/>The Minister should institute a programme of awareness and coping skills in our schools.  Young people today are increasingly facing stresses that previous generations did not have to cope with.  In their teenage years, however, they may face their first serious moment without having developed natural coping skills.<br\/><br\/>I again urge the Minister to establish a national mental health authority, similar to the Road Safety Authority, which is independent of the Government.  Such an authority could assess and challenge Government policy, thus ensuring mental health resources are delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400027#Z00800","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464109500,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400028#AA00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1464109500,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It would be foolish, however, to think for a second that all the stigma and fear surrounding these issues have been overcome.<\/p>  <p>  Public representatives must be part of an open dialogue in partnership with the communities we represent.  That compassionate conversation must honestly begin to tackle prejudice, fear and isolation.  Massive credit is due to the many brave individuals who have experienced mental health or emotional well-being issues, including suicide, personally or in their own families.  Through their own drive, passion and initiative they have founded a plethora of local community organisations throughout the country.  They have been key to opening the door for others, letting people know that they have somewhere to turn and are not alone.  Such initiatives go against the old, hard-chaw, pull yourself together attitude that may have typified earlier responses to people in mental or emotional crises.<\/p>  <p>  We must recognise that we all have a part to play in this.  It is an issue that concerns every Deputy, Senator and citizen.  We need to bring that conversation to communities in towns and villages throughout the country.  Our goal must be to end stigma, discrimination and isolation.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health and emotional difficulties respect no boundaries of class or colour.  They are as likely to affect one individual or family as the next.<\/p><p>It is not unusual at all for somebody to experience a mental illness.  It is even more common for people to experience emotional ill health and pressure and, sadly, for many people, suicide and self-harm loom large.  We can all make a difference.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on her appointment and she has a particular role to play.<\/p> <p> Let us not make any bones about it.  It is not that we are facing into a crisis in our mental and emotional health; we are in the middle of a crisis.  All the statistics, which I will not recite, tell us that.  We have heard them many times in the House.  In a crisis situation, crisis responses are required.  The challenge for the Government and the system is not only to say the right things and lead that compassionate conversation, but it is also about resources.  To put it a little crudely, it is about the system putting its money where its mouth is.  A fraction of Government budgets is spent on suicide prevention.  If the moneys dedicated to road safety and accident prevention measures, worthy as they are, are weighed against the amount dedicated to suicide prevention, it tells a story, which is that the system does not yet understand or prioritise the issue in the way it should and it must.<\/p> <p> I refer to CAMHS, in particular.  All of us know there is a crisis in these services and all of us know about the waiting lists and the desperation of families across the State trying to access them.  That needs to be sorted out.  A Vision for Change is ten years old and it is being reviewed but it has not been fully implemented.  Let us vow and give a commitment collectively that we will not allow another year, five years or ten years to pass without this commonly agreed strategy being implemented and properly resourced.  The staffing crisis in the services is most dramatically underscored by the fact that the Psychiatric Nurses Association has a ballot for industrial action up to including strike action.  This is not because they do not care about their service users.  On the contrary, this is a response to what they correctly call \"the staffing crisis in the mental health services\".  That is where it sits.  Human desperation and all the pressures we are familiar with and that speak to our common humanity have people reaching out for help and finding in so many instances that it is not there.  We, as politicians, the Government and the Minister of State need to ensure resources are provided and the &euro;12 million that was to be ring-fenced from the health budget is reinstated, drawn down and spent on these essential services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400028#AA00400","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464110100,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I also congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment.  I do not have much time but I could speak for an hour on this issue.  I am glad the three Ministers in the Department are present because one of the issues I have come across is that of dual diagnosis where somebody has a mental health issue and an addiction and how they are dealt with.  There is no single solution.  Everyone has to be treated on a case-by-case basis.  It is important to remember that everybody's mental health is different and their needs and responses will be different.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald referred to the issue of stigma.  Great work has been done on this, particularly when it comes to self-harm, suicidal ideation and depression, but a major taboo is still associated with many other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorders.  We do not have the same focus on breaking down this stigma.  A great deal of work, therefore, remains to be done on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are encouraging people to be more open when it comes to speaking about mental health but if they suffering from depression, anxiety or another mental health illness, their first port of call in most cases is their local GP.  I am frustrated that it is not mandatory for GPs to do basic courses to enable them to deal with people who may have suicidal ideation such as SafeTALK, or the ASIST programmes.  It is also not mandatory for garda&iacute;.  These professionals, who are on the front line dealing with people when they first seek help, therefore, do not have the basic skills to deal with them.  In many cases, the response from some GPs is to medicate but that is not always the solution.  Medication may be part of a solution but every individual is different.  Many of the individuals who end up in therapy find cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, and talk therapy helpful and, therefore, sometimes a combination of medication and therapy is needed.  Something that could be done instantly at a low cost is to encourage doctors and members of front-line services to engage in programmes such as SafeTALK and ASIST to give them the basic skills to deal with people in order that they do not always instantly reach for a prescription, which is counterproductive.<\/p>  <p>  We have not got our head around understanding how to treat mental health.  I read a number of WHO reports from 2015.  One report states: \"Mental health can negatively be affected by low income.  Those who cannot afford private therapies or care are the most at risk of crisis which exacerbates the issues at hand.\"  While income does not discriminate against whether someone has a mental illness, it is a factor in accessing services.  The report also states: \"An environment that respects and protects basic civil, political, socioeconomic and cultural rights is fundamental to mental health promotion.\"  We need to take that on board as a State because we have citizens whose cultural rights have not been recognised and others whose socio-economic and political rights are not on the same footing as everyone else.  Equality, income and socio-economic issues and the societal and public health response to them are all critical in helping to address this.  While money is important, it will not in itself solve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400029#BB00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1464110100,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I also congratulate the three Ministers on their appointments.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I refer to the &euro;12 million that was to be assigned to the mental health budget this year.  This was bravely and hard fought for by my friend and colleague, Ms Kathleen Lynch, the former Minister of State.  That money cannot be allowed to fall back into the black hole of general health spending.  It is a relatively minuscule amount in the context of the overall spending on health but it is very important for people whose mental health is fragile.  I urge the Government to put that money back into the mental health budget.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the drive to ring-fence money for the development of mental health services in 2012 under Ms Lynch's passionate and determined stewardship, the money has been used to fund support for community organisations working on suicide prevention, education of GPs on suicide prevention, a primary care counselling service, access to psychology and psychotherapy services, additional beds for CAMHS, clinical nurse specialists to respond to those who present with self-harm in accident and emergency departments, a national clinical programme for eating disorders, training in behavioural family therapy and the roll-out of Jigsaw, a particularly positive development that has been mentioned on previous occasions when this issue has been debated in the House.<\/p><p>I had the opportunity to visit Jigsaw in Galway a few years ago.  Funding was provided under this ring-fenced money to roll out Jigsaw, a young person-friendly service, in two areas in Dublin, two areas in Cork and one in Limerick.  Jigsaw is a service that young people can walk into.  I know from visiting the Galway centre several years ago that it has given young people the opportunity to have a place they feel they can go to when they are concerned about mental health issues.  I spoke about community organisations being funded.  Much of this has gone into youth services.  Limerick Youth Service was recently allocated funding for its youth mental health programmes.  <\/p> <p> I have read out a list of areas where this ring-fenced funding was used in the past number of years.  It is simply unacceptable that this progress in such a crucial area of the health service should be halted in any way.  I ask the Ministers who are here today to give a commitment that this money will be restored.  If it is not, there will be a sense that people are being let down, that services for vulnerable people have been underfunded for a long time under successive Governments and that the mental health area has been very much neglected.  The signals will be wrong and the practical services that are being provided with this money will be underfunded.  <\/p> <p> Of the &euro;12 million that was to be used this year, &euro;5 million was to be used to recruit up to 100 psychologists and counsellors to develop psychological services for those under 18 in primary care.  We must not fail to deliver this service.  An analysis of the waiting list for acute mental health services for children and adolescents demonstrated that at least 20% of those waiting did not need an acute psychiatric service.  A psychological or psychotherapy service would have been more appropriate but was not always available.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made some points a few minutes ago about ensuring that the services that are available are the ones that are most appropriate.  In many cases, these services are cheaper to deliver than some of the traditional services that are available, or unavailable in some cases because people cannot access them.  It is important that we focus on this funding and that it continues in future years because the area has been very under-resourced and one-dimensional in the sense that a person sees a psychiatrist and everything flows from that whereas people sometimes need something that is more talk-based, more based in their community and more accessible to them.  We cannot afford to go back on the progress that has been made.  <\/p> <p> I looked at the section on mental health in the programme for a partnership Government.  While it takes up a few pages and refers to the Government being committed to meeting the recommendations in A Vision for Change, which is welcome, it is quite vague.  Reference is made to reviews that will advise on certain things.  I would like to see more specific commitments and I hope the new Minister will be able to work on ensuring that there are more specific and deliverable developments in this area.  There is quite a lot of knowledge around what needs to be done but what we really need is implementation.  While there are many good general aspirations in the programme for a partnership Government, many of them are less specific than most people would like.  <\/p> <p> I will refer briefly to education, an area in which I worked, and the importance of a positive culture that supports people's mental health and ensuring that bullying does not happen because that very often affects people's mental health in a very negative way.  Schools are required to have anti-bullying policies.  Much work is being done with organisations like BelongTo in respect of homophobic, transphobic and Internet bullying.  In terms of a culture of nourishing people, inclusion and care in schools and society in general, there has been far more talk about mental health in a positive sense.  This is very good and we need to continue doing that.  However, there are still areas where people feel they are being singled out as being different and, therefore, when they have an issue, they find it very difficult to talk about it and feel they are still part of the organisation, community or school.  We need to ensure that we continue with that work.  <\/p> <p> There is a commitment in the reform programme to making well-being a compulsory subject for the junior cycle by 2017.  I look forward to seeing that implemented because well-being as a subject is about the whole person and physical and mental well-being.  It encompasses many areas but if we can embed it in our young people along with a sense of responsibility for themselves and those around them, we will have a far more positive culture in which people feel that if they have mental health issues, they can engage very early on with somebody who can help them.  This would be so much more positive than waiting until people have acute issues.  <\/p> <p> There are a number of other areas.  We need to see far more linking of education, health and community services.  I again urge that this ring-fenced funding be restored to the mental health budget and that we continue to ring fence funding for mental health developments because this is such a crucial area for so many people who still feel that their issues are not being responded to.  Ireland is becoming economically strong and we need to ensure it is socially strong and that people who are not having their needs met can have them met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400029#BB00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464110700,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I extend my good wishes to the new Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, and the new Minister, Deputy Harris.  I wish them the best of luck in their new portfolios.<\/p>  <p>  The mental health service remains the Cinderella of the health service.  The recent removal of &euro;12 million from the mental health budget indicated the manner and esteem in which mental health services were held by the previous Government.  The new Government must urgently return this funding in a manner that allows it to be spent in a practical and effective way on front-line services.  That figure of &euro;12 million could have been spent on many other areas and in many other ways.  Examples include school educational programmes and concentrating on early intervention, the sourcing of counselling and other therapies from the private sector where no public services are available, providing 24-hour crisis intervention services for acute health problems and supporting voluntary agencies like Pieta House and the many other organisations that provide essential support services such as the William Winder Rainbow Foundation for suicide prevention in my county of Clare.  Recent Ministers of State have had to fight hard to prevent the same siphoning off of funds that had been allocated to mental health services.  I hope the current Minister of State will not have to fight the same battle.  <\/p>  <p>  As mental illness may not have the external signs that one would associate with physical illness, it can be more easily missed and overlooked.  A high proportion of consultations in general practice have a mental health component, which may be the entire reason for or a significant component of the consultation.<\/p><p>A high proportion of mental health issues are dealt with within general practice, yet those who need further assessment and treatment find it difficult to access specialist services and therapies due to a shortage of front-line staff.  Thank goodness that our old institutional model of care has been dismantled and replaced with a much more progressive model where treatment is delivered in specialist inpatient units that aim to return patients to their communities as soon as it is safe to do so for continuing care and follow-up.  However, these services need to be resourced properly and our community multidisciplinary teams are not being completely staffed.<\/p> <p> In my catchment area, there has not been a psychologist in place for the past four years.  There is no cognitive behavioural therapy, yet many patients require this service.  There is just a half-time equivalent occupational therapist.  For one staff member to be taken on, two staff members need to leave the service, and since last week we have an additional embargo on new recruitment for already depleted staff levels.  There are problems in recruiting and replacing consultant staff.  The reduction in new consultants' pay by 30% significantly reduced the number of applicants for vacant posts.  Prior to this poorly thought out pay reduction, there could be ten to 12 applicants for a vacant post.  Now, one is lucky if there is any applicant and even luckier if anyone accepts a post, yet &euro;12 million earmarked for new staff has been taken out of the mental health budget and a new embargo on recruitment has been imposed.  Where is the logic in that?  It can only have one result and that is certain future reductions in front-line services and poorer outcomes for patients.<\/p> <p> Across Europe, 12% of the health budget is spent on mental health services, yet in Ireland it is less than 8%, which is one third short of the European average.  Mental health budgets are promised to be ring-fenced, yet they rarely are.  Inpatient beds in acute mental health units are in short supply and the demand outstrips the bed numbers.  These units are always at capacity and it is illegal to exceed their maximum number.  There is pressure consequently to discharge patients sooner than planned and, when discharged, community disciplinary teams are not in place to monitor and assess their recovery.  Furthermore, the failure to resource these teams adequately is leading to unnecessary readmissions to the acute units.  As we know, mental health problems are not confined to social class, income or age.  Child and adolescent mental health services are not properly resourced.  Those aged between 16 and 18 have nowhere to go.  Child and adolescent services say they are too old for their service and adult services say they are too young.  As a result, they are dependent on the kindness of strangers to look after them, when they require urgent care.<\/p> <p> There is also a lack of resources in old age psychiatry.  Dementia services suffer from a lack of home help and home care packages and there is great difficulty in sourcing these.  I understand there is to be a further reduction in home care packages.  Dedicated dementia units are required to cater for a subgroup of patients who have specific needs and are not suitable for general psychiatric wards.  Quite often there is an inappropriate mixture of elderly patients who suffer from mild dementia and those who have advanced dementia and challenging behaviours, which is quite unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Ireland has a high rate of male suicide due to social and economic pressure.  Farmers who were encouraged to invest in their farms are now, due to falling prices, under pressure from their banks to sell their stock and assets to pay their debts.  Housing problems, homelessness and mortgage difficulties are also causing serious mental health problems.  There is a crisis of hope in our society as austerity has had a serious effect on mental health and the economic recovery is patchy and creating divisions in our society.<\/p> <p> Adolescents and young adults are subject to social pressures.  They are expected to be high performers and high achievers.  They are expected to conform to unhealthy media driven and peer driven body image.  They suffer from a lack of jobs and opportunities, rising rents and a lack of housing, and drug abuse is a huge problem.  Cluster suicides are all too common.  There were seven suicides in the midlands recently in a short period, and death by suicide is now far more common than death due to road traffic accidents, yet no area of the country is immune from suicide and it is suffering from an increased response to despondency.<\/p> <p> The organisation of our mental health services is driven by a bureaucratic management rather than clinical management.  There is minimal clinical input from those delivering the service and this does not make common sense.  It hinders the delivery of good patient outcomes and there is a disconnect between management and the front-line staff who deliver the service.  The entire management structure of our mental health services needs to be reviewed with a view to putting the patient first and focusing on giving clinicians a critical say in how their services are delivered.  A Vision for Change, published in 2006, which was to deliver a comprehensive active, flexible and community-based mental health service has not been fully implemented.  Even though it was not a perfect document, if it had been delivered on, patients would be much better served.<\/p> <p> It is essential that the Government fully implements A Vision for Change.

The last time statements were made on it, I was unable to get a slot such was the popularity and interest of Members in wanting to be part of trying to find a solution to this problem and to be part of the debate around it.<\/p><p>When we take a very narrow focus of toing and froing with the Government on who spent more, who cut more and all of this kind of thing, we are missing a lot of the fundamental point.  We are also doing a further disservice because we are abdicating our own and society's responsibilities.  We are all citizens - brothers, sister, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, neighbours, friends, work colleagues and students - and we all have a role to play in mental health.  We should focus the debate less on resources and a narrow definition of percentages.<\/p><p>I have to take issue with the previous speaker, Deputy Michael Harty, on percentages.  When one compares Ireland's mental health budget as a percentage of the overall budget, the reason for the disparity is because of the amount of money we spend on drugs which is far in excess of the amount spent by many other countries across the EU.  That distorts the percentage so it is an unfair comparison to say it is 8% versus 12%, which is the European norm.  Any independent analysis would find that we spend more <i>per capita<\/i>on mental health.  I do not want to enter into that debate.  In 2015, we spent something like &euro;826 million on mental health, which was up from &euro;711 million in 2012.  That is a 16% increase in the mental health budget versus an 11% increase in the overall health budget.  If we enter into those debates, we are missing many of the broader factors and I would like to broaden out the debate and look specifically at our collective responsibility and role in addressing the issues facing mental health because it is an increasing challenge, particularly for young people.  I will hone in specifically on the education side of things in my contribution.<\/p><p>I was speaking to a number of experts recently and I asked some consultants if there had been a serious increase in the incidence of mental health issues and what they would attribute it to.  Very interestingly, they informed me that while there has been a significant increase in the presentations of issues surrounding mental health, the physiological element to it is not increasing noticeably.  Incidences of things like bipolar, schizophrenia and those sort of issues have not increased but the basic coping skills and coping mechanisms that people have to try to deal with matters are causing more and more problems.  There are obviously a variety of reasons and we need to move the debate on to that.  What is happening in society that is causing so many of our young people to feel that they cannot cope with the stresses and tests of everyday life?  Trying to protect people from those stresses and tests is easier said than done.<\/p><p>Moving to the education system, I have always advocated that we can play a vital and productive role in this area.  I have advocated also for the broadening of mental health awareness among teachers and pupils of schools.  Much of that can be done by way of debate, awareness and people watching out for each other.  I have always advocated the enabling of teachers in that regard.<br\/><br\/>When people think of mental health, they think of a crisis.  They think, &quot;Oh my God, I am not equipped to deal with this&quot;.  I taught in both primary and secondary schools but mental health is about encouraging people to ask, &quot;How are you?  Are you doing okay?  How are you feeling today?&quot;.  Those are the initial steps that must be introduced in primary school and all of us must have a part in reaching out to each other and trying to promote that awareness in terms of the whole area of mental health.  There are amazing resources for anybody in the education system who wants them, including the <i>Iris the Dragon<\/i>books.  I have read some interesting books for young children that deal head-on with many of the issues around the challenges in the area of mental health.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, in the past 30 or 40 years our education system has become driven by points, attainment, competitiveness, and having to serve the needs of industry, commerce and so on.  It is about playing its part in a successful economic society, but our education system is failing us if we are ignoring the cohort of people who are struggling at the expense of the commodification of education that has emerged in terms of grinds schools and so on.  There is an inherent lack of understanding that, as a society, we must encourage a broadening of our education system to ensure that the dignity of every child is respected within the education system and that we must develop, promote, enhance and encourage their physical, mental, spiritual and emotional well-being to allow them reach their potential, whatever it may be.  That is a challenge for all of us to take on board.  I refer to teachers in particular because any of us who have children know how much they adore their teachers.  In my day we were not so fond of our teachers but they are the most trusted people who are in daily contact with our children, whether they are in primary or secondary school.  There is enormous potential in that regard and we should invest resources in upskilling those teachers.  They are a caring and compassionate profession who want to be involved in this area but we must resource them and put the necessary supports in place to ensure teachers can recognise problems and, where it is more serious, refer for further help.<br\/><br\/>I always felt the term &quot;mental health&quot; was a difficult one for people of my generation and older.  Heretofore, there was a stigma associated with the word &quot;mental&quot; in terms of being locked up away from society.  Thankfully, younger people do not have the same view of that term.<br\/><br\/>I would like to see more co-operation among Departments.  The Department of Health is represented here for these statements on mental health but I would like to see the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs in particular, and even Social Protection, coming together to identify and address some of these issues.  Many of the issues and challenges I have identified can be addressed by taking  simple steps.  It does not have to involve massive change.  Much of it is cultural, particularly in our schools because it is our young people who are affected.  I spoke recently with a psychologist who told me that many adults are presenting now for counselling to deal with issues, most of which can be traced back to their early development years.  It is in their early years that people fail to cope with issues, and they present for therapies much later in life.  If our school setting was more open, with a more holistic approach taken and everyone embracing their responsibility, and this is not about divesting responsibility from parents onto schools but about everybody being aware, caring and embracing this challenge, we would have much more success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400031#DD00200","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464111900,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin.

Bills pile up, homes are repossessed and jobs are lost.  More hours are spent in cars stuck on bottleneck roads.  Children are spending more time separated from their parents and families.  People are time starved, with less capacity for leisure and community activities, and all of that leads to mental health pressures.<\/p>  <p>  The proper care for those in need and the erosion of stigma about those people in need and who are suffering must be prioritised.  Stigma is one of the most damaging factors undermining personal well-being and mental health.  The stigmatised person is marginalised, devalued and rejected, and the greatest tragedy of all is that stigma keeps people from seeking help.<\/p>  <p>  Our minds are our most treasured possessions, and yet the most fragile of all we possess.  In recent years there has been a considerable growth in the number of voluntary organisations which are addressing suicide or mental health related issues.  The wonderful work of the Samaritans, Pieta House and Console on a national level must be acknowledged and applauded.  <\/p>  <p>  We have more community recognition, initiatives and supports than at any time in the past.  I see at first hand in Kildare the incredible work that Jim Brady and Hope D do in organising help and support for those in need of urgent counselling.  I must also pay tribute to Peter Hussey, one of my personal heroes in life, who has established a group called Crooked House in Newbridge, which essentially helps young people, and particularly young people at risk, to develop the necessary coping skills to deal with all that life throws at them.  Through theatre, drama and improvisation I have seen hundreds of young people in Crooked House deal with subjects as diverse as suicide, sexuality, depression, voting, civic participation and teenage pregnancies.  The work of Crooked House has been acknowledged on a European level but, sadly, not in Ireland in terms of funding.  I invite every Member of the House to come to Newbridge to see the incredible work it does.<\/p>  <p>  Every one of us has a role to play in giving shape to a nation that cares for the mental well-being of all its citizens.  It is welcome to see so many people in the public eye who come forward to share openly their stories about their own mental health struggles.  That naturally will have a positive effect on removing the stigma associated with mental health issues.  However, the test will be the extent to which we have nurtured a culture in society in which people in distress are encouraged not to feel any less of a human being or any less worthy of help, and to realise that mental health can be recovered after it has been lost; a culture in which we do not feel embarrassed about our own, or a family member&rsquo;s, mental health, and it all starts with each of us and our own prejudices, ideas and actions.<\/p>  <p>  I find it shocking and horrendously disappointing to every citizen who has been impacted by mental illness that money from the mental health budget has been diverted into the general health budget.  My home town and county has been rocked by deaths due to mental illness and shortfalls in treatment for mental health.  Just over three years ago the small town of Rathangan, with a population of 2,000, suffered five suicides of young men within a few weeks.  I will never forget the sense of tragedy and overwhelming grief that pervaded our town for a long time and that has truly never left, but there was a strong community response and through our community, local youth club, Scooters, Hope D and the Health Service Executive, measures were put in place to help others.<\/p>  <p>  During a short period of time early this year, five men died by suicide in Newbridge.  There was hardly a person in the town not deeply affected by that epidemic.  Kildare has the lowest funding for mental health and young people than any other county in the country.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has stated that one in four of us will experience some mental health problems in our lifetime.  Mental health issues continue to silently inflict immense damage on our country.  The undercurrent of depression, anxiety and addiction is a profoundly ingrained problem for society.  No family is untouched by some form of mental health issue.<\/p>  <p>  Our society is struggling to compensate for the shortcomings of a regime that will not take a holistic approach to funding mental health in a manner that treats every citizen equally.  Under-resourced guidance counsellors at all levels of the education system understand the importance of mental health services for teenagers and young adults.  They get it.  Voluntary organisations, youth clubs and sports clubs have identified young people at risk and are doing their best to help.  They get it.<\/p>  <p>  The big issues currently facing our society are inextricably linked.  I refer to housing, health and crime.  Very recently, a principal of a second level school in Newbridge confided in me that one of the main problems facing children in her school was the threat of being without a roof over their heads.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health is a major issue.<\/p><p>I would love to speak to many areas but I cannot do so in five minutes.

I am delighted for them and their families and I am sure it is a great honour for them.  All I can say to begin with is that I hope they are not treated with the same contempt as their predecessors responsible for this area.  I never doubted their commitment and the former Minister of State, Ms Kathleen Lynch, was a fantastic person and very focused on the job at hand.  Sadly, the cupboard was always raided and the money was never available that it was thought would be available.  It seems that is the way this Administration is starting too, with a diversion of &euro;12 million and rumours of other money going away.  As a nation, we have continued to pay lip service to mental health.  It seems everybody agrees with the content of A Vision for Change, which started in 2006, but as of today less than 40% of it has been implemented.  There are rumours that psychiatric nurses are preparing for strike action because of the lack of supporting numbers.<\/p>  <p>  I know many colleagues have dealt with all the different aspects of mental health but suicide prevention is of most interest to me.  Everybody in this House, the Seanad and wider society has an interest in this issue.  The only thing missing is our making a penetrative impact by resourcing the plans we have and the strategies developed by experts.  They can begin to peel back the blindfold on the phenomenon of loss of life through suicide.  It is a battle we are continuing to lose and which we refuse to face.  For example, we know the equivalent number of people in two planes crashing - 600 people - are affected.  That is the population of an entire village wiped out.  If it happened in another country, the United Nations would send in troops and Concern would call for additional investment.  As Irish society always does, we would dig deep to support the cause, yet we have done nothing.<\/p>  <p>  We have developed a great strategy, Connecting for Life, and the Minister of State and I discussed it on Vincent Browne's show.  I do not doubt the brilliant innovations in that and I recognise some stuff from the paper I wrote on the matter.  This is not about credit or anything like it but rather the implementation of that plan.  The money is just not being made available to it so the question is whether we are serious about wanting to save lives.  What is needed, in effect, is a national authority.  One regularly hears a comparison being made with the National Roads Authority, and, at the peak of its work, it spent in the region of &euro;200,000 per fatality to deal with the problem of road deaths.  The most spent in this country so far in trying to deal with loss of life through suicide, in a similar comparison, was &euro;6,000 per fatality.  That does not equate to the kind of commitment indicated by the rhetoric of these houses following a high-profile suicide or that of a child and so on.  It does not equate to the kind of commitment we ought to have.<\/p>  <p>  There was a tragic murder this morning and if a suicide was treated like that or as in another country, we would throw money at the issue.  We simply just do not care.  There are broader mental health issues throughout the country, in Sligo and Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan, which I represent.  Does the Minister of State know how long it takes to see a child psychologist in those areas?  Does she know how difficult it is when a 17-year-old with difficulties turns 18?  Those people get thrown under the bus because they are out of the system.  We say, \"Sorry, you can join the queue over there and we will get to you when we can\".  There is an issue in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the murder this morning in Dublin, what we have at the top of the Garda is the same as what we have at the top of the Health Service Executive.  There is a senior crew and everything they say is laundered through a public relations agency to make it sound good.  All of us know through our constituencies - the towns, cities and rural communities in which we live throughout the country - when we speak to any health care professional that they are worked to the bone.  The resources are not there and what resources there are might be spent in the wrong place.  Perhaps they are caught in administration; at least that is what we all love to think.  Morale, as in the Garda, is at an all-time low in this area.  Health care professionals engaged in the mental health services, particularly those in suicide prevention, are not getting the support or resources they need.<\/p>  <p>  With suicide prevention, there should be one authority and appropriate resourcing to implement Connecting for Life and the many good parts within it.  That means there should be more resource officers in every community.  We do not need an organisation in every townland associated with suicide prevention.  All the actions should be determined by the National Office for Suicide Prevention or a single national authority.  It should not be buried in the bowels of the HSE, subservient to the budgetary constraints that it has on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400033#FF00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1464112500,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Funchion.

Recently, depression has become somewhat synonymous with sadness or a prolonged sense of sadness.  I fear we are beginning to draw closer to a place where mental illness is almost synonymous with depression or anxiety.  Social media has presented us with an opportunity to share our thoughts with the world, whether it is a light-hearted joke or opening up about our personal struggles.

Combined with a simplistic analysis by elements of the media, sometimes this dynamic can result in a somewhat simplistic view of what may be a very complex situation.  Conversation and public discourse has become somewhat generalised.  We then overlook the greater topic on a whole, as this somewhat simplistic version is presented as a microcosm of what is a significantly more complex topic.  This takes nothing away from those who choose to tell their story, for whom it makes a big difference in dealing with their own issues, which takes significant bravery.  Ba ch&oacute;ir an gn&iacute;omh sin a mholadh sa tsl&iacute; go cuireann s&eacute; chun cinn caint mar sl&iacute; chun cabhair a lorg.<\/p><p>Talking, however, is not always the answer.  There are many cases where talking will go a long way in helping deal with the issue.  Alternatively, there are also many illnesses or conditions where talking will not resolve the issue or where it is only part of the solution.  This is a place to which we must take the discourse.  With mental illness, the conversation is relatively new to many people and us, and as a result the conversation has yet to begin to develop.

She speaks of her own experience with borderline personality disorder, coupled with bouts of depression, and how she has become fed up by the constant media hype and sanitisation of mental health and its portrayal within sections of the media.  She made a valid point in how we view mental illness and the use of the term mental illness being a condition in and of itself, rather than getting into the intricacies of the diverse complexities that the umbrella term represents.  It is a valid point of concern.<\/p><p>She went further to look at the term &quot;physical illness&quot;, how it is never deemed to be a sufficient diagnosis and that it covers such a broad spectrum.  She stated:<\/p><blockquote>We have come up with a way of talking about mental illness that separates it from physical illness, and I believe this is making it far more complicated than it should be.  For starters, there is the fact that we are using the term &quot;mental illness&quot; in the first place.  We would never say &quot;I have a physical illness&quot;.  We would say &quot;I have the flu&rsquo;.  Why should any of the many and varying mental health conditions that people live with be treated any differently?<\/blockquote><p>She continued:<\/p><blockquote>We want mental illness to have parity with physical illness, but at the same time, we are setting it apart.  The two go hand in hand and should not be separated.  When we are physically unwell, it is difficult to have a positive and upbeat outlook.  When we are mentally unwell, it is very difficult to physically do the things that we know will help.  One feeds into the other, one cannot exist without the other.<\/blockquote><p>Is tuairim&iacute; tabhachtacha iad seo agus is d&oacute;igh liom gur ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas iad a th&oacute;gaint san &aacute;ireamh.

However, in the interim, we can and should find other ways of encouraging people to look after their mental health.  For example, tax can be claimed back for a whole variety of procedures and treatments, from dentistry to laser eye surgery.  Why not for counselling or psychiatric treatment for the general population, or for any of the many treatments that may assist in safeguarding good mental health?  This is not ideal, but could be an interim measure.

I want to focus on two areas.  The first relates to mental health among our children and young people.  We all know there has been a significant increase in the number of children and young people suffering in relation to mental health, particularly with anxiety and depression.  I  commend the role that the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, carries out.  However, it is drastically underfunded and understaffed.  Just over half of the required staff are operating in the child and adolescent mental health services at present and it is not uncommon for children and adolescents to wait in excess of a year to be seen.  In my own constituency, I was dealing with someone recently who is 16 years old and is facing an 18-month wait.  The parents were in contact with me - I know many people will have this type of story - because they are so worried about their son, who will not come out of his room, and they are faced with 18 months of not knowing what exactly is wrong and how they can help him.  We cannot stress that enough in respect of young people.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see an increase in the number of CAMHS teams throughout the country and to ensure that they are staffed and funded properly.  It cannot be stressed enough how crucial early intervention is for a child or young person presenting with a difficulty, whether it be depression, self-harm or an anxiety disorder.  There have been cuts to guidance counselling in school.  Cuts in 2012 have resulted in a 51% reduction in the one-on-one counselling available for children and adolescents.  Again, this can often be a first port of call for young people experiencing mental health difficulties.  I urge the Minister to restore the funding in this sector.  It would cost &euro;14.7 million to restore the 700 posts in this field.<\/p>  <p>  All of this leads to the old saying that prevention is better than cure.  When we look at our young people, we do need to look at our education system as well.  There are many schools that have access to play therapy for young children, particularly those at primary school level, but unfortunately not all schools have access to this service.  It is usually linked to schools that are dealing with the school completion programme and that are in disadvantaged areas.  That is one service we need to look at expanding.  It costs very little and play therapy can be instrumental in helping a young child at primary school level deal with anxiety in particular.  That is something we are seeing more and more of on a daily basis with young children and if it is not dealt with, it develops into this major obstacle for a child and can impact on their education and how they perform in school, on their relationships with friends and family and on their social life.  It has such a knock-on effect on everything and it goes back to the argument that prevention is better than cure.  We talk a lot about mental health nowadays, but that is one area that gets overlooked.  The CAMHS runs a very good service, but I do not think they access play therapy for younger children, and that is something we need to look at in respect of the education system.<\/p>  <p>  My last point relates to the suicide crisis assessment nurses.  These nurses liaise with GPs where there are concerns about patients who may be suicidal, but only 24 of the 35 nurses approved for this programme have been recruited.  I urge the Minister of State to go ahead with the job of recruiting the rest of these nurses, because it is key when somebody is in crisis that they have access to the services and do not have to wait.  That is the big problem we all see on a daily basis with people who come to us: they have to wait and unfortunately they cannot afford to wait.  For many people when they are going through a difficult time, if they finally make that decision to reach out to a GP or whoever it might be and they do not get the service, they then decide there is no point and it has a knock-on effect.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure correct and adequate funding goes into these services because we cannot just be talking about it - we really have to see action on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400034#GG00400","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1464113100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I wish to begin my contribution to this mental health debate today by highlighting what I believe to be a very important goal for this Chamber to achieve over the course of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, namely, to ensure that the general public is better able to understand the workings of this Chamber in the future.  I say this with regard to the controversy that unfolded around this mental health debate on 5 May, and to the fallout on social media over the supposed poor attendance and lack of interest in the topic.  At this stage, I would also like to congratulate our new Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Catherine Byrne, who are with us this evening, and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  I am not sure whether the Acting Chairman is aware, but what sprung to prominence was a split second snapshot from a three-hour debate where ten or so Deputies were in this Chamber.  It was then inaccurately and, in my opinion, maliciously portrayed simplistically online as if only there were only that number of Deputies in Ireland who cared about this issue.  This was hurtful to those Deputies who had sought to speak on that day but could not do so, due to the time constraints involved in the three-hour debate.  No matter the issue, 158 Deputies could not speak in the time period given.  As Members may be aware, I later read via <i>TheJournal.ie<\/i>, that over the course of this debate 39 Deputies contributed to the debate and 27 others were present in the Chamber.  These are the true facts.<\/p><p>The Acting Chairman may be aware that the main cause of the recent public anger surrounding mental health funding is due to the reports on the supposed cut of funding in the mental health budget by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in 2016.  However, when one takes the time to look at the figures involved it becomes very clear that this claim could not be any further from the truth.  To his credit, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, had, since his first budget in the Department of Health in 2012, fought for and overseen increases to both the mental health budget and the overall health budget in general.<\/p><p>For example, in 2012, the national mental health budget was &euro;711 million.  In 2016, it had increased to &euro;827 million.  This is an increase of 16%.  Since 2013, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, had increased spending in the mental health budget at a higher percentage than any other service in the HSE budget, including vital areas such as the ambulance service, the fair deal scheme, cancer care and vaccinations.  This is a very important aspect to understand, so I will repeat it: he increased funding in the mental health budget every year since he was appointed Minister and at a higher percentage than any other service in the HSE.  To say otherwise is wrong and should be challenged with the facts involved.<\/p><p>However, unfortunately this type of factual information is not as popular or as shareable online.  This is the world we now live in and which we as public representatives must rise to meet.  The real difficulties for mental health services came during the period between 2008 and 2012, when the mental health budget was reduced substantially, like all other areas of the health service.  This was hard to accept for many and even more difficult to implement and endure.  However, we all know the reasons for this happening.  They lie with the bad management of the economy, the financial crash that followed and the loss of our economic sovereignty.<\/p><p>As we are now in a strong period of positive economic growth once again, we can continue to increase the mental health budget.  In terms of mental health spending locally in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, while there are always difficulties with mental health services, such as staff recruitment and service amalgamations, I believe we can now look forward to increased funding for local services.  In Sligo-Leitrim, funding has increased by over &euro;1.6 million since 2013.  However, I now want to see this returned to pre-crash levels.  In 2016, it is expected that the HSE will spend &euro;23.6 million on mental health in Sligo-Leitrim.<\/p><p>In 2006, we spent &euro;26.5 million locally and I want to see more services and staff employed in the sector locally and for the budget to allow this.  We need to see a continual increase in funding for the mental health area.  I am confident, however, that reforms, new staffing appointments and management changes are all aspects which will also have a beneficial effect.<br\/><br\/>Our mental health is very fragile, sensitive and open to fluctuation, which is normal.  Being able to talk to someone about our problems is key.  We need to break the stigma and illuminate the point that it is okay to feel down and unhappy; this is part of life.  I believe that campaigns such as the HSE's Little Things campaign are very important.  Websites and online resources such as <i>Joe.ie<\/i>deserve credit for promoting mental health awareness and advice to large audiences.  I hope the State will continue to improve the overall services on offer and I look forward to this happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400034#GG00500","speaker":"1343","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464113700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Shane Cassells who will be sharing time with Deputy Declan Breathnach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400035#HH00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1464113700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on mental health.  I congratulate my fellow royal county colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Helen McEntee, on her appointment to ministerial ranks.  We may share different political backgrounds but we both had famous uncles who soldiered on the great Meath teams of the 1980s so myself and my family are particularly pleased for her.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the cross-party committee from the previous D&aacute;il which recently staged a very successful and informative launch in Leinster House of the green ribbon campaign and the See Change movement.  The contributions by Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Troy, Doherty and O'Sullivan were all insightful but more importantly they were all positive.  The people who spoke at the launch all spoke positively about mental health well-being and that was very insightful.  The guest speakers on the day who addressed their own past problems spoke about the importance of having somebody who will listen and somebody simply caring.  Most strikingly, they spoke about the issues around resources and the need for support services because there are times when just kind words are not enough and the services of professionally trained people are required.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a young lady from Trim contacted me.  She has suffered from agoraphobia for the past 15 years and it has become so bad in the past few years that she cannot leave her apartment.  She wrote to complain about the lack of help available for herself and others with the illness.  She attends mental health services in Trim.  She had an appointment in early May for which she had to take Xanax in order to attend.  She is allowed only ten tablets a month since the medication is addictive and she hates having to take them.  She can only go as far as her neighbour's house without having to take Xanax.  At her appointment, she was told that the service would not send someone out to her apartment to help her because it was thought this would enable her.  She was told she should go to see a therapist in Trim but she would not be allowed to take that particular medication.  The problem is that this person cannot get to the appointments without taking Xanax and even when she does take it, she finds it difficult.  She suffers from panic attacks and depression and she is reaching out; she wants to be helped but the system is working against her.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of this debate I heard Deputy Josepha Madigan speak about the psychiatric services in the State and say that there are now some top class facilities available.  However, in my own county we are on the cusp of losing our 24-7 acute psychiatric unit facility and having it downgraded to a Monday to Friday service which would open during office hours.  That is not how real life works but that is what is being proposed with the potential implementation of this measure in July.  At the beginning of May, I tabled a parliamentary question to the previous Minister on this matter and I still have not received a response.  What does this say of the HSE in how it treats this D&aacute;il with contempt and no regard whatsoever?  More importantly, what does it say about how the HSE treats patients in Meath upon whom this decision will impact?  Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, as the Minister is very well aware, is under threat across a number of areas in the services it provides and the Save Navan Hospital campaign has done fantastic work in protecting these services.  I acknowledge the presence of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in the Chamber who is the chairman of that campaign and I also acknowledge the exceptional work of Dr. Ruair&iacute; Hanley on that campaign.  However, the proposed downgrading of the acute psychiatric facility needs to be addressed.  It deserves and demands an immediate response and I hope the Minister of State will address it in the House this evening.  I sincerely hope that as a Meath woman she will intervene to attain the 24-7 facility and I hope that having three Ministers in Meath will carry some weight in fighting this decision.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke yesterday with Christopher Rennicks, the chairman of the Meath River Rescue service.  It is a voluntary organisation which is over 20 years' old.  It has, unfortunately, seen its services required more and more in recent times.  We do not want to see these services more in demand.  We do not want a scenario where a person presents in Navan outside of office hours and finds acute psychiatric facilities are not available.  There is little point in Deputies making speeches in this D&aacute;il Chamber about mental health if there is no commitment to the resources required.  I am appealing to the Minister, on behalf of the hospital campaign, and more importantly on behalf of the patients who use the facility, to interject and to ensure the retention of that facility on a 24-7 basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400035#HH00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1464113700,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this mental health debate and I too congratulate both Ministers of State on their elevation.  According to the HSE, one in four of us will have mental health problems at some stage in our lifetimes.  Putting that into perspective, at least 39 Members of this House and four of the 16 Cabinet Ministers will experience mental health problems at some stage.  Outside this House, we all engage with family, friends and neighbours who too often suffer in silence with what in their view is an inadequacy in their own make-up when the real problem is an inadequacy in the provision of resources to help them.  In the past, mental health was too often dealt with in cold, monetary and statistical terms.  Now is the time that we in this House and beyond need to see this as a collective, surmountable issue and target a warm, sustainable, national solution to help those suffering with mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the creation of a mental health authority to provide focus through an organisation with the treatment of mental ill health and distress and the promotion of positive mental health as its sole focus.  There needs to be definitive ring fencing of funding for mental health services.  That means an end to pulling the rug from under these services to shore up other health services.  The World Health Organization recommends that a total of 10% of the total health budget needs to be set as a target and ring-fenced.  The mental health authority could also help with focusing on tackling homelessness among those with mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party believes the Government should carry out a full review to see what has and has not been achieved with a view to ensuring that targets are met over the next ten years.  The Government should hold a mental health summit with all key stakeholders.  A renewed respect for stakeholders' input is critical to rebuilding trust with this sector.  The review group should consider placing particular attention on the need for non-medical approaches to dealing with mental health issues.  It should also ensure that the recovery model ethos is placed at the centre of mental health policy as expressed in the policy document that will follow on from A Vision For Change.  We also need to re-establish the implementation review group that would issue regular updates on progress and delivery of the plan.  Finally, there is a need to establish a service user representative body to ensure a quality of respect to all those who are involved across the spectrum of service users and providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400035#HH00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1464113700,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment; it is a great honour I am sure and a great responsibility.  I wish her every luck in the coming months and years.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on mental health today and I acknowledge the importance the Chamber has placed on the topic.  It has received several hours of debate with much input.<\/p><p>Based on my past five years in this House, we disagree, as we should, on many issues.  However, mental health seems to be one of those ones where there is much agreement on what the challenges are, how important mental health is and what needs to be done about it.<\/p> <p> In preparing my speech today, I did what probably many Deputies did; I looked at the mental health reform figures.  I have seen them before and I have used them before in this Chamber, yet they absolutely shocked me.  They have been repeated - I have listened to much of the debate - and they are worth repeating again.  In Ireland today, almost one in ten adults is experiencing a mental health disorder, one in seven has experienced a mental health difficulty in the past year and, by the age of 25, one in five of us has experienced some form of mental health difficulty.  These figures have been stated by many Deputies over the past few days.  I have seen them before and I have used them before, yet, when I pulled out my notes to prepare for today, I was again shocked at how prevalent and damaging this is.  It means that probably every one of us - certainly the majority of us - is either dealing with a serious mental health issue or have friends and family doing so.<\/p> <p> I would like to focus on youth mental health, which is an area in particular need of intervention, although the entire mental health service needs help.  Again, a figure that floored me today, which I have seen before, is that we have the fourth highest rate of teen suicide in Europe.  We have problems in Ireland, but we are a modern, reasonably progressive and wealthy nation.  That we have the fourth highest rate of teen suicide shocked me when I saw that figure today.  More than one in five young adults have indicated that they have engaged in self-harm.  As I have heard other Deputies reference, a recent study of LGBT young people found that one in five has attempted suicide, one in four has self-harmed and one in three has thought seriously of ending his or her life in the past year.<\/p> <p> Youth mental health workers that I speak to in Wicklow tell me that morale is so low in the system, from psychiatrists to psychiatric nurses, that they are finding it hard, where funding has been provided, to fill the posts.  I was particularly taken by one psychiatrist I spoke to a few months ago.  She works outside Dublin in the commuter belt.  She said that youth mental health services are so difficult to access where she is that the GPs in the area are writing letters for young people stating they are at imminent risk of suicide and telling them to present at emergency departments in Dublin.  They are using that as the pathway to accessing youth mental health services.<\/p> <p> I do not mean that to score any political points.  I do not think any one of us would want that for anyone.  However, this goes to the heart of the matter.  I have heard several Fine Gael Party Deputies speak about some of the funding improvements and hiring that has occurred.  While that may be going on, and may it continue, we must acknowledge just how desperate the situation is right now.  This is not something that needs a little more money or a few more staff.  This is a system in crisis and we are failing our young people.  If it is true, and I have no reason to believe the psychiatrist I spoke to was misleading me, then this is a crisis and it needs to be dealt with as a crisis.<\/p> <p> I would like to acknowledge several welcome pieces in the programme for Government.  Increasing the mental health budget year on year is very welcome.  Fully implementing A Vision for Change post-review is welcome.  I was delighted to see a reference to ensuring support in crisis and I guess that is part of the example I have just given of young people presenting in accident and emergency departments.  Sufficiently staffing our primary care centres with mental health professionals, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses is also very welcome.  However, the programme for Government is lacking.  It is not the place for the programme for Government, but what is not in it and what we need and I imagine what the Minister of State will be dealing with right now is a timeline for implementation, with allocated budgets.  As she knows, we need 1,000 psychiatric nurses by the end of the year and we know that the Psychiatric Nurses Association, in light of low morale, is balloting for action.  My understanding is we need to double the number of consultant psychiatrists as well, which is what the professionals have advocated.<\/p> <p> A Vision for Change is a great document and a great plan, but it is ten years old and was written in a very different socio-economic environment.  While the programme for Government calls for an update and an expert review, which is absolutely the right call, we have to start seeing some timelines.  I heard nothing but support for five years for A Vision for Change in this Chamber during the last D&aacute;il.  However, there is nothing to hold any Government or us, the Parliament, to account.  We need goals, timelines, deliverables and allocated budgets.<\/p> <p> If we are serious about addressing and improving mental health, we must have an honest conversation about funding.  We know that Ireland spends less on mental health services, preventative care and community care than comparable countries and we are experiencing difficulties in all three of those areas.  Since 2011, the number of psychiatric beds per head of population has halved, so this is serious stuff.  We know that as a percentage of our health budget we spend 6% on mental health.  Our closest neighbours spend 10%.  These are not marginal changes.  These are big things that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p> There is a need for reform in youth mental health.  We need to move from the two-stage model we have, which is a paediatric-adult model, to a three-stage model, which is a paediatric-youth-adult model.  We have to provide a user-friendly and welcoming entry mechanism for young people.  We cannot have young people presenting at accident and emergency departments except in the most extreme emergency.  To have them going in and sitting on a plastic chair at a formica table in the local community or health centre is not the right way for us to be welcoming in young people who have mental health issues.  We need a welcoming service.  What we have at the moment is a very siloed service which kicks into action when things get quite bad.  Obviously, we need more prevention, and I know this is something the Minister of State is interested in.  We need more prevention, but we need a much more holistic and joined-up service as well.<\/p> <p> We need these reforms, but we must have the money, which is why the tax base has to be protected.  It is so that we can both reform and invest in these critical services.  The reality is that we have the fourth highest rate of teen suicide in Europe and one of the lowest levels of taxation on labour.  These are OECD figures and not Social Democrats propaganda.  That is the reality and that is what we are dealing with.  We desperately need investment in mental health and in youth mental health services and we already have one of the lowest levels of tax on labour in the OECD.  Here is the question for all of us.  I believe we all agree on the importance of mental health.  I do not hear people try to score political points very often on this debate.  We all agree with the need for reform and new funding.  Therefore, this will come down to what we believe is more important: investment in mental health services and youth mental health services or further tax cuts.  That is the choice.  That is the choice that will be put to this House in October.<\/p> <p> I will finish by reiterating that I wish the Minister of State the very best.  She has a very difficult and hugely important job.  The Social Democrats and I have every intention of engaging in a constructive way.  We may end up disagreeing on how much money is required, with us looking for more, but I wish her the very best over the coming months and years in this role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400035#HH00500","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Domestic Water Charges: Motion [Private Members]","time":1464114300,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400036#JJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1464114300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Is Deputy &Oacute; Broin moving the motion?

It has mobilised hundreds of thousands of people across the State in national demonstrations and local demonstrations in every town and parish and it has been behind a massive objection to what people rightly believe is an unjust and unfair tax.<\/p><p>However, the Right2Water movement is also important because it has brought together communities, trade unions and politicians from a variety of perspectives.  In doing so, it has kept the issue of water charges and the debacle that is Irish Water on the agenda.  A large number of Deputies recently elected to the House signed up to the Right2Water policy principles in advance of the general election.  Others, often under pressure from the vast mobilisation of popular opinion, made clear commitments to abolish Irish Water and end water charges.  Thanks to this movement throughout the State in recent years, a majority of Deputies in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il are opposed to water charges and want to see Irish Water scrapped.<\/p> <p> The motion we are debating is an unusual Private Members' motion in the sense that it was not drafted by a particular political party.  It was drafted on behalf of the Right2Water movement that many of us belong to.  It seeks to give a clear voice to the hundreds of thousands of people who support our aims.  The motion was drafted by Deputies from Sinn F&eacute;in, Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit, Social Democrats, Independents 4 Change and others.  It was also drafted to match the manifesto commitments of all Deputies who, during the election campaign, committed to scrap Irish Water and end water charges.<\/p> <p> We are realistic and understand how Standing Orders work.  We understand that we cannot table a repeal Bill on the floor.  Therefore, we have to make do with a Private Members' motion.  The value of the motion is not only that it gives popular expression to the will of a majority of the electorate but that its passing would put considerable pressure on a Government which, on this issue, is clearly not listening to the democratic will of the people.  Irrespective of what has been said thus far in the debate on the motion outside the Chamber, I urge all Deputies to actively consider supporting the motion now.<\/p> <p> At the heart of the Right2Water movement is not only opposition to an unfair and unjust tax but a belief that water is a human right that should be provided on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  We reject the drive at home and throughout the world to commodify the provision of water services.  We do not believe domestic water charges are socially just.  Nor do we believe they are the best way to promote the conservation of what we all understand to be a scarce resource.  We believe that water should be provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay, that water and sanitation services should be funded through general taxation and commercial charges and that the public ownership and management of water services must be protected in the Constitution.  We also believe that water conservation would be far better pursued in the first instance by fixing our decrepit and leaking water system and then by investing seriously in real conservation measures in homes, public buildings and businesses.<\/p> <p> I imagine no one believes our water and sanitation systems are fit for purpose and that we will hear as much from all sides of the debate in the coming two days.  We know that 121 water treatment plants need urgent upgrading.  We know 156 wastewater treatment plants are too small and many are in breach of EU regulations.  We have all seen the graphic images of commercial and domestic waste being pumped into our rivers and seas.  We should ask ourselves why this is the case.  The answer is simple.  It is because, for decades, Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael refused to invest in water and sanitation infrastructure, just as they refused to invest in our health system, our housing system and other vital front-line public services. Now, the same politicians who were responsible for the crisis in this vital service are pleading with us to follow them on their fool's course to rectify the problem.  We are told that throughout the European Union and the OECD the Irish Water model has been proven to work.  Thanks to policy interventions of the European Commission, we are moving ever closer to a fully commercialised and commodified model of water service provision.  We are told this is more efficient, but what we are not told is the human cost of this so-called efficiency.  When we take a vital public service that has been provided on the basis of need and transform it into a service for which people have to pay, only one thing that is sure to happen, and that is inequality.  It may not happen in a week, a month or a year, but inequality in access to water is what will follow this failed policy.  In 2013 in a report to the Department, the ESRI made clear that water poverty was a real prospect of any charging regime introduced in this State.  Deputies who maintain that that would never happen in this fine State should look at our health system and the levels of inequality as a result of access to health care being determined by ability to pay rather than medical need.  They should look at the crisis in our housing system, under which a roof over one's head is determined by ability to pay and not by access to housing as a right.  We could go on with examples from education, child care and all other front-line services.  I do not accept that we cannot have world-class water and sanitation systems in public ownership funded through general taxation that are socially just and environmentally sustainable.  That is why I am a member of the Right2Water movement and that is why I support this motion.<\/p> <p> I will take the final three minutes of my shared time to refer to the two amendments, particularly the amendment from my colleagues from Fianna F&aacute;il.  I pulled out an interesting publication this morning and was leafing through the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto.  It is an interesting document and it is worth reminding the House what it states.  There are four separate references in the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto to the subject of water.  All four state exactly the same thing, that is, a commitment to abolish Irish Water and end water charges.  This is the case in every mention.  Exhibit B in this sorry tale of yet another Fianna F&aacute;il flip-flop on the issue of water is its agreement with Fine Gael.  What does it state?  It states, \"The Government will establish an External Advisory Body on a statutory basis to build public confidence in Irish Water\".  The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto makes four references to scrapping the failed entity, yet the party has signed up to a deal with Fine Gael to rebuild confidence in it.<\/p> <p> In case anyone is under any illusion about water charges, the agreement states, \"The Government will establish within eight weeks of its appointment an Expert Commission to make recommendations for the sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services\".  Of course this leaves the door open to water charges.  It is a far cry from the second paragraph of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which mentions \"the minority Government facilitation arrangement which sets out a clear path for an end to water charges in accordance with the wishes of a majority of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  Deputy Cowen should note that these two documents do not match; they are not saying the same thing.  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment to be tabled this evening is fundamentally dishonest.<\/p> <p> People in the Chamber have a clear choice.  Those who honestly and genuinely believe that Irish Water is a good thing, that it is doing a good job and represents value for money to the taxpayer and that domestic water charges should continue should vote with their principles and support the Government amendment.  However, Deputy Cowen and his colleagues should note that those of us who campaigned to oppose Irish Water and water charges have a clear choice today and tomorrow to speak against water charges, to vote against them and increase the pressure on the minority in this House who believe that water charges and Irish Water should continue.  They have the choice to listen to the will of the people and scrap the charges.  Any suggestion that the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment is consistent with the pledges the party made to the electorate in the election campaign is fundamentally dishonest.  That is why I will not support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment or indeed the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400036#JJ00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464114900,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I commend this motion, tabled by 39 Teachta&iacute;, calling for the immediate abolition of domestic water charges.  The motion is finally being discussed after weeks of stymying of the discussion by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Neither party wanted Teachta&iacute; to have their say on the issue of water charges and Irish Water while they conspired behind closed doors in the partnership negotiations to push this issue down the road.  It is worth noting that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have voted together on five separate occasions already in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il to block this motion from being tabled.<\/p><p>I made the case at the time and I make it again tonight that water charges should be dealt with here in an open, democratic and transparent fashion befitting the judgment the electorate made on water charges during the general election.  Every Deputy elected to the D&aacute;il has an obligation to fulfil the commitments he or she made to the electorate.  A clear majority of Deputies, as the motion says, sought and won a mandate to abolish Irish Water and scrap water charges.  That is our view and our mandate.  It is also Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s mandate.  Its manifesto, not once but, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, on numerous occasions, called for the abolition of Irish Water and the scrapping of water charges.  Nowhere does it say anything about the suspension of charges, kicking the issue down the road to an Oireachtas committee or maintaining the mechanism for charging citizens on the Statute Book.<\/p> <p> If Fianna F&aacute;il were serious about fulfilling its election commitments, it would support the motion before the D&aacute;il this evening.  I wrote to the Fianna F&aacute;il Leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, last week asking him to support the motion which was specifically worded to accommodate Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s manifesto position and its election commitments, but he has not responded.  Despite this, Fianna F&aacute;il has this evening tabled an amendment to the motion heralding the suspension of water charges and its agreement with Fine Gael as if this were good enough.<\/p> <p> It is not good enough.  Water charges have met their end, and so has Irish Water.  That fact must be accepted and it is the rise of people power over the past two years with hundreds of thousands of citizens coming out to protest against water charges which deserves the credit for this seismic shift in politics in this State.  A total of 500,000 citizens also voted for Right2Change candidates in February.  It is a slow process but there is a fluidity about our politics at this time which is to be welcomed.  The previous Government used its majority to railroad regressive legislation through the Oireachtas, including water charges, the establishment of Irish Water and the family home tax.  All were the brainchild of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s deal with the troika.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a society based on equality and fairness.  That means building a fair, new tax system and ending unfair regressive taxes that penalise working families and vulnerable citizens.<\/p> <p> In the North our party stopped the imposition of water charges.  We want to dismantle Irish Water in the South and replace it with a new model of governance and a funding stream that is fully accountable to the Oireachtas.  We will oppose any attempt to privatise water services.  We stopped the British Tories from privatising water services in the North.  We will do the same when and if Irish Tories try to do that in this State.  I commend all the Deputies who brought together this collaborative Bill.  We want to see also the referendum which would bring about public ownership which would be enshrined in the Constitution.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il say there are no plans to privatise services.  Surely if that is true, they will have no problem supporting a referendum to this effect.

This motion is supported by 39 Deputies, all of whom signed up to the Right2Water campaign.  A motion to scrap water charges should have been debated in the House weeks ago, but between them Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il saw to it that the democratic will of the people was thwarted and that no such debate took place.<\/p><p>In my constituency, Limerick, 60% of those who voted opposed water charges.  As we debate today's motion, I have absolutely no doubt that nobody voted, campaigned or marched for a deferment of what they rightly saw as an unfair tax. <\/p> <p> Today's motion gives us, as elected representatives, the opportunity to do away with this onerous tax and by so doing implement the democratic will of the people who elected us.  There can be no ambiguity whatsoever about this.  The failure to support today's motion by voting against it, abstaining or supporting a watered-down motion, as Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to do, is not what the majority of people voted for in the last election.  Fianna F&aacute;il may think it can play its usual brand of sneaky double-standard politics with this issue but, rest assured, it is fooling nobody.<\/p> <p> The provision of clean water is an essential public service that is recognised by the United Nations as a basic human right.  Therefore, water for domestic usage should be freely available to everyone and retained in public ownership.  Water charges discriminate against working people and the unemployed in favour of the well-off.  They are another regressive tax taking vital money out of the pockets of ordinary people and, by extension, out of the local economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in is a key part of the Right2Water campaign and is committed to abolishing household water charges.  I am proud that this is our party's first Private Members' motion.  This is what we said we would do and, unlike Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, if we give a commitment we keep it.<\/p> <p> Some 90% of the water used in this country is used by large corporations, but only 10% is used by domestic householders.  Under the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government plan, householders would bear 80% of the costs and subsidise water for big business, setting the stage for privatisation.  The current Fianna F&aacute;il-controlled puppet Government is no better, with its long-fingered plan to suspend charges temporarily as it awaits the findings of the commission.  No one should be fooled by Fianna F&aacute;il and its born-again mantra of being against water charges.  If it was genuinely against water charges, now is its chance to get rid of them.  However, in keeping with classic Fianna F&aacute;il tactics, it has once again kicked the ball into touch in the hope that charges will go away, but they will not.<\/p> <p> Water charges originated with Fianna F&aacute;il.  It signed up to them with the troika, and Cabinet papers revealed it intended to charge every household &euro;500 for water.  The fudge of wavers and allowances, and now the suspension or deferment cooked up between the two establishment parties, are not acceptable.  People voted with their feet through Right2Water and they made their voices heard again at the ballot box.  Water charges must go and they must go now.<\/p> <p> The message is simple.  A majority of Deputies in this Chamber were elected on a mandate to scrap water charges.  The vast majority of people voted to scrap water charges.  The latest figures released from Irish Water show that people are not paying this unfair tax.  Deputies elected on an anti-water charges platform have a duty to vote in favour of this motion and not the amended version which seeks to suspend charges.  Above all, the Government must respect the democratic will of the people expressed at the ballot box and scrap the charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400038#LL01200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464116100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I commend those Deputies from outside my party who are supporting the motion.  I cordially invite Deputies Kelleher and Cowen, and their colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, to do what they said they would do, namely, take action to end water charges and support our motion.  We will not say, \"We told you so\" afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il was at pains to tell us over the past few days that its amendment underpins the agreement that exists between the two parties that sit nominally on opposite sides of the House.  After all of its posturing last week on the mortgage Bill, it is right back being the best boys and girls in the class and is supporting the Government.  That is what Fianna F&aacute;il does when it is in government in all but name.<\/p>  <p>  Strict adherence to its confidence and supply arrangement is, it tells us, in the national interest and its counter-motion of course underpins that.  It is a pity that its agreement with the electorate is not underpinned by anything in its motion.  People voted for what is in the national interest and for the abolition of water charges.  That is very clear.  They did not vote for a suspension, for us to kick the can down the road or for more meetings, hearings and reports.  The feet on the street and votes in the ballot box were decisive.  The only thing that is not decisive is what is being proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Let the starting point be the abolition, not the suspension, of water charges.  While Fianna F&aacute;il threw itself at every news outlet to lambaste Sinn F&eacute;in and my colleagues and accuse us of shouting from the sidelines, it should have concerned itself with what it had shouted from the sidelines.  Believe it or not, I tend to agree with some of what its Deputies said previously, such as the wastage of money and the costs associated with Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  One of the best descriptions of Irish of water was that it was a money pit.  Last year, my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Brien, remarked that every single day that Irish Water remains in operation it costs the State and taxpayer a fortune.  He described it as a money pit that has done nothing but run up almost &euro;1 billion of debt.  He said by now we could have pumped hundreds of millions of euro into upgrading water systems and implementing conservation measures.  Instead, this money has been spent on adding an expensive and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that has spent taxpayers money on consultants fees, PR stunts, management salaries and bonuses, staff perks and water meters that have been rendered useless.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Brien said the game was up and that it is time to scrap Irish Water before it cost taxpayers even more money, and I agree.  Deputy O'Brien made some very good points, for which I commend him.  The game is up.  We cannot kick the can down the road.  We must take decisive action now.  Deputy O'Brien was correct.  We cannot afford to have water charges and all that go with them in existence for a moment longer than is necessary.  We can act today and tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is that if Fianna F&aacute;il was serious about scrapping water charges or its best friends in government had any interest in listening to what the people said at the last election, it would take immediate action and support our motion.  It would not waste a single shilling of taxpayers' money any more than it has done already.<\/p>  <p>  It is not that long since we had an election.  I want to assure every single Member of the House that the mood of the people has not changed.  They remain resolutely opposed to water charges in my constituency, Fingal, and I have no doubt the same view pertains all over the country.<\/p>  <p>  I canvassed in Swords, Kinsealy and Balbriggan last weekend.  It behoves me to tell the Government that it is on a fool's errand if it thinks it has any hope of rebuilding confidence in Irish Water.  I sincerely hope things stay fine for those in government because the people voted to send the vast majority of Deputies to the House to oppose Irish Water and water charges.  Anyone in the House who believes that people do not know or, God help them, cannot tell the difference between abolition and suspension is sorely mistaken.<\/p>  <p>  We are fooling nobody if we think we were elected to kick this particular can down the road.  We were not, and Sinn F&eacute;in will not go back on the promise it gave to people because we gave them our word and will be as good as our word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400039#MM00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1464116100,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I would like to address some remarks to Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and those Independent Deputies who support the Government.

By the end of this week, one person somewhere in the country will receive the last in the latest tranche of the one and a half million new Irish Water bills now being delivered across the State.  Incredibly, a Government which has already conceded suspension, has allowed Irish Water spend nearly &euro;1 million of people&rsquo;s money to send out the bills.  I appeal to every single household in this country to boycott that last Irish Water bill.  People should boycott the bill and send a powerful message that they will accept nothing short of complete and total abolition.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputies say they are merely taking a different route to us towards the same goal, but they have a number of questions to answer.  First, if they are opposed to the water charges, why did they not call in this debate for an immediate cessation of the metering programme?  Second, if they are opposed to water charges, why did they not call for the refunding of payments made under duress to Irish Water by hundreds of thousands of households across the State?  Last, but not least, why did they not call for all of the arrears owed by the households that have boycotted the charge to be completely written off?  They are the households who have brought the Government to its knees on this issue, yet not only do Fianna F&aacute;il Party Deputies not call for the arrears to be cancelled, they demand that those households be pursued for the arrears.<\/p> <p> Many of the Deputies who will vote tomorrow night to derail this motion are supporters of the water charge.

If tomorrow night they vote to derail a motion supported by the movement of which they were once part, then tomorrow night will be the night when the full implication of their crossing that line becomes clear.  One could ask whether those Ministers of State will side with the representatives of the ruling class against the movement of which they were once part and go against the wishes of so many of the people who elected them less than three months ago.

I have no time for that type of politics.  They have been used and abused by the previous Government and the new Government continues to do so.  It is time to put an end to the failed entity which has been rejected by the people.  The vast majority of us were put in here because we promised that to the people, including Fianna F&aacute;il.  It really is time that we saw some sign of the new politics in this Chamber, where words mean something.  The biggest problem we encountered on the doorsteps as we canvassed was that people simply have no faith in the political process any more.  They see it as utterly removed from them and they cannot trust a word that comes out of our mouths.<\/p>  <p>  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il Party Members to put a meaning to the language they use in this Chamber when they talk about a new era, new co-operation and a new language.  I also ask them to stand with the people, not in a populist manner, but because the people saw through Irish Water and, more importantly, they saw through what the Government was doing in relation to Irish Water, namely, setting up an entity with a view to the privatisation of the most fundamental service we require &ndash; water.<\/p>  <p>  I have no difficulty with paying my taxes in return for services and neither do I have any difficulty working with any Member in this Chamber on the conservation of water.  We have very good experience in Galway of recycling and we led the way in that regard.  On more than one occasion I used the example of where we had a wonderful service in Galway.  On an ongoing basis we had a 56% diversion from landfill to recycling.  In a pilot project, we diverted 70% to recycling but what happened?  They privatised the service.  We were the second last local authority service in the country to be privatised and we have a mess on our hands at the moment in terms of the collection of waste.  I will be penalised because I have three compost bins in the garden.  That is the exact same parallel and the same reasoning that was being used with Irish Water.  It is time to stop and to stand together and say water is extremely important and we need to resource it and conserve it.  I sat in the city council in Galway for almost 17 years and I watched good engineers and very good staff come under extraordinary pressure because of the lack of resources and money.  I saw water polluted.  I experienced cryptosporidium myself.  As I speak, 8,000 people in Carraroe cannot drink their water.  We know the facts in Galway city.  We are not trying to evade our responsibilities.  We are trying to take them on board and to work in a positive way.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il, even at this late hour, to see sense.  Let us lead.  We do not need to penalise people in order for them to conserve.  We have shown that in Galway.  Penalties do not work, and humans by their nature are good.  They need encouragement and example and we are not showing that example.  The entity of Irish Water has been rejected.  Any entity that could spend &euro;400,000 of taxpayers&rsquo; money in seeking to find out what the people of the country thought of them in various polls is an obscenity.  I do not blame Irish Water for that.  The staff of Irish Water are under extraordinary pressure to follow Government policy.  The word obscenity does not describe an entity that could spend &euro;80 million on consultants, at a time when water pours out of leaking pipes and water sources are polluted.  I find it insulting to be told we are negative when we give a different view.  The groupthink in this country is what led to the mess and the banking crisis.  Many times various judges, including retired judges, have pointed out that if there was less groupthink and more questions answered we would not have scandal after scandal.  We will discuss the O&rsquo;Higgins report tomorrow, which has the exact same thread running through it.  I happily and proudly support the motion.

A total of 945,000 people were dependent on drinking water supply requiring remedial action, almost 20,000 people were on boil water notices and 49% of all water produced was lost through leakage.  The capital city, Dublin, which should have had a spare water capacity of 10% to 15% like most European capitals, had a spare capacity of just 1% to 4%.  Major drinking water schemes such as those in Vartry, County Wicklow, and the Lee Road scheme in Cork were antiquated and in need of significant modernisation.  In 44 urban areas throughout Ireland, untreated sewage was going into rivers and seas, thereby posing a major risk to public health and the environment.  This is a snapshot of what was known at the time.  Irish Water then began to uncover new legacy problems as it began to map assets and compile data.  By the beginning of last year, it had identified 156 wastewater treatment plants that were overloaded.  Moreover, 70% of sewers were in need of repair while the public water network had 55,000 km of water mains, that is, more than twice the average length per head of population in England and Wales and significantly higher than what was thought to be there.  The problem of insufficient spare capacity was not confined to Dublin as one third of water treatment plants did not have sufficient headroom capacity.  These treatment plants form part of an infrastructure that has an average age twice that of infrastructure across Europe.<\/p> <p> As to why we had these problems, put simply it was because we are guilty of having underinvested in water infrastructure and services for decades.  This is one thing on which I do agree with many Opposition spokespersons.  The capital allocations for vital water and wastewater projects and upgrades competed with, and more than often lost to, other more pressing and tangible investment requirements such as roads, schools and hospitals.  In addition, these problems existed because 34 local authorities were providing services and infrastructure on a sub-national basis, defined as they were by diseconomies of scale in procurement and network and asset management.  This resulted, despite the dedicated commitment and professionalism of local authority staff, in often financially constrained circumstances.  A new approach was needed as without it, the water services would continue to be deficient thereby putting at risk security of supply, protection of public health and the environment, as well as the water needs of citizens and businesses alike.  For these reasons, the Government established a single national utility to deliver water services and infrastructure.  Such a utility could plan and invest on a whole-of-asset-base basis and on a national basis.<\/p> <p> Since Irish Water became the national water utility in January 2014, it has made significant progress in addressing some of the problems to which I referred.  By the end of 2015, Irish Water had delivered 20 new and upgraded water treatment plants and 49 new and upgraded wastewater treatment plants.  In addition, 500 km of pipework has been repaired or replaced.  For too many people, the reality of having to boil water before using it for drinking or cleaning has become far too familiar.  Last year, 17,300 people in County Roscommon no longer were obliged to boil the water coming out of their taps.  This is real progress and is making a difference to people's lives and is progress in which Irish Water's expertise and work has been instrumental.  The number of people dependent on water supplies listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's remedial action list of works requiring remedial action has reduced significantly over that time.  From 945,000 two years ago, it now stands at 800,000, which still is too large but is reducing.  Dublin's spare water capacity has increased from 1% to 4% to 10%, which is a welcome move towards the 15% target of Irish Water.  Through the 835,000 meters installed by the utility, Irish Water has been able to identify customer-side leakage and to offer householders repairs under the first-fix repair scheme.  By the end of February 2016, approximately 39.5 million litres of water per day had been saved through this scheme and through domestic customers' repairs arising from leakage detected through metering.  To put this figure into context, the entire water needs of Wicklow in a single day amount to 34 million litres.  It makes far more sense to save existing water than to build new plants without addressing leakage on both the public mains and the customer side.  The metering programme also has been crucial in the identification of possible lead piping in householders' properties.  Irish Water is helping to implement the Government strategy in reducing public exposure to lead in drinking water.  It has written to 34,000 households informing them of the likely presence of lead piping in their properties and has provided them with customer advice on dealing with the issue, including public health advice from the Health Service Executive.<\/p> <p> In parallel with increased investment, Irish Water has introduced new approaches to asset management and maintenance.  It plans investment consistency across its asset base, rather than on the basis of large-scale one-off investments.  This approach, including the use of new technologies, has been rolled out across major projects such as the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade, which has saved significant amounts of money.  In addition to savings on capital projects, Irish Water has reduced day-to-day expenditure.  Year on year, Irish Water has reduced operational costs by 7% since 2014.  It is standardising the way in which operations are conducted and is implementing new initiatives to bring down costs.  Among these savings is an expected &euro;30 million in procurement efficiencies between 2014 and 2016.  Some of this progress arises from the innovative and national approach adopted by a public utility.  However, increased investment also is critical.  In 2013, local authorities invested approximately &euro;300 million through the water services investment programme. This year, Irish Water expects to invest approximately &euro;550 million in the network, which represents an increase in investment of 83% in just three years.  As a result, new water treatment plants are coming on stream and major projects such as the Cork lower harbour project now are being delivered.  This investment will secure quality drinking water supplies and will contribute to ending the reality of raw sewage being discharged straight into rivers and seas.<\/p> <p> I will shortly establish an expert commission to examine and make recommendations on the sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services by Irish Water.  A special Oireachtas committee on the funding of domestic water services will debate the commission's recommendations and ultimately, this House and the Upper House will consider and decide on the future of charges.  This process should take no more than nine months from the end of June of this year and I ask Members to afford the commission and the special Oireachtas committee the space and time in this period to independently put the facts and funding issues before the Oireachtas.  This is why the Government's amending motion must be supported.  Important decisions that affect each citizen in the country should not be taken in a vacuum that will exist until the committee's recommendations are put before the House.  Members must acknowledge the significant level of investment Irish Water is making.  It is imperative for Members on all sides to ensure this investment can be sustained and that the &euro;5.5 billion in capital investment Irish Water needs between 2014 and 2021 to deliver the commitments in its business plan is made available.  Without consistency of funding, the legacy problems of poor water quality, inadequate wastewater treatment, high leakage levels, lead pipes and antiquated infrastructure will not be addressed and nor will supplies be secured against the pressures of a growing population, an expanding economy and climate change.<\/p> <p> The issue of public ownership of water services is one on which people have strongly held views, as do I.  Water is fundamental to everyday existence and the public has consistently espoused the idea that water services and the national utility should not be subject to market forces and nor should people's access to water be determined by private commercial interests owning or running water services for profit.<\/p><p>In 2014, the Government reinforced the legal safeguard against any future privatisation or semi-privatisation of the utility.  The Oireachtas legislated to prohibit the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government from initiating a legislative proposal to privatise Irish Water or sell any share held by the Government without the prior approval of a majority of voters in a plebiscite and without a resolution from both Houses of the Oireachtas approving such a proposal.<\/p> <p> I will finish by making an appeal to the House.  Deputies will get the rest of my speech, but I do not want to take up any more of my colleagues' time.  We are trying to allow for an informed and detailed discussion on how we fund water provision and waste water treatment in the future.  We are trying to take some of the heat out of this issue by providing a nine-month window for that debate.  We will get experts from Ireland and other parts of the world to make recommendations.  The Oireachtas committee that takes those recommendations will not be bound by them, but I hope it will be guided by them.  We will have an opportunity to vote in this House as we see fit at the end of that debate.  An issue as important as water provision for our people and our country surely deserves that time window for a rational discussion and debate before we make a decision of that importance at the end of that period.  <\/p> <p> I commend my motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400040#NN00900","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464117900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on water charges.  I wish to clearly outline my position on this issue, set the record straight and deal with the misrepresentation of my position.  This debate is about suspending water charges or getting rid of them.  Until the independent commission sits, makes up its own mind and goes to the Oireachtas committee with its final recommendations, and a final vote is taken in the D&aacute;il, I support that process.  That is the vote that counts, and my colleagues should judge me when that vote happens.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which Irish Water was set up, and its approach, remain personally unacceptable to me.  I am still deeply sceptical about the motives and ability of the service to deliver.  There are also affordability issues, and I certainly feel there was a lack of insight as regards people's everyday financial struggles.  There are many examples of this, including the fact that families were left to their own devices with regard to replacing lead pipes in their homes, and the failure to take into account the significant additional requirements of many people with special needs.<\/p>  <p>  However, I recognise that the recent negotiations on government formation, in which I was involved, have resulted in the establishment of a mechanism to review the provision of water and its infrastructure.  It will be crucial for the review to take into account the position of people who have paid their charges, as they should not be disadvantaged.  After that important process, I will finally make an informed decision.  Over the course of my career I have fought for many issues, but none more so than those facing our country today.  They include homelessness, health, care of the elderly, cystic fibrosis, education, small businesses, the rights of and services for people with disabilities, as well as many other issues.  I now find myself in a position in which I have an opportunity to oversee real development and policies in our areas of need.  I have a responsibility to try my best to deliver for people who are relying on me in these areas.  I know that priorities must be set and I do not believe that not paying the water charge at this stage will greatly alter the situation for Irish Water.  The debate has moved on and will be a matter for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in due course.  It is clear to me that not paying the charge would become a significant distraction to other important work.  I am determined not to allow this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Like many people here, I do not like the set-up of Irish Water and neither do I like the system of charges.  I was very much opposed to that.  However, I think the first part of the battle has been won.  We now know that charges will be suspended and the whole system will be reviewed.  It will be a matter for a D&aacute;il vote as to whether or not charges are imposed.  I strongly support the principle of the main motion in dealing with the public ownership of water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400042#PP00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1464117900,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this evening's debate.  Once more we are before the House debating the issue of Irish Water.  Sinn F&eacute;in and others want us to immediately abolish water charges and then establish a public water and sanitation board to deliver water.  We are being told constantly that support for 75% of those elected to this House was based on their opposition to water charges, but this is simply not true.  A poll taken of those who voted at the recent general election revealed that only 8% stated that water was the most important issue for them.  Yet, to listen to Sinn F&eacute;in and others, one would think that water charges constitute the only issue affecting this country.<\/p>  <p>  This week, we had a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy on local radio stating that compliant taxpayers who have paid their water charges should not be refunded, and those who have not paid their water charges will not need to pay them.  When he was questioned as to why those who have paid could not be refunded, the Deputy simply stated that the country could not afford this.  Yet again, this is more of the same hypocrisy from Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  If, as they state, we cannot refund water charges, how do they propose to fund the cost of providing a safe and reliable water and waste water system in the future?  It is just more fantasy economics from Sinn F&eacute;in and others who are supporting them.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also states that a water and sanitation board should be established to deliver water on the basis of need.  Is this not what Irish Water is doing already?  They want to abolish Irish Water and replace it with a new Irish Water, but this position makes no sense whatsoever.  It is about time Sinn F&eacute;in and others stopped this populist charade and were truthful with the public on how they plan to fund the water and waste water infrastructure.  At least we in Fine Gael have a clear position on how we want to fund this.  We fully believe in the benefits of maintaining a national utility to fix, upgrade and maintain our water network.  How else are we going to fund the necessary upgrades that are needed for our water network?  If anybody needed evidence on how Irish Water is already fixing our water infrastructure, they need only look at the situation in Dundalk.  I was delighted to announce recently that Irish Water, in conjunction with Louth County Council, is investing more than &euro;3.4 million to upgrade water networks in the Dundalk area.  Among the areas to be upgraded are the Lower Point Road, Clanbrassil Street, Dublin Road, Marian Park, Legion Avenue, Ardee Road and Castletown.  The work will involve replacing over 9,000 metres of existing water mains.  It is estimated that those works alone will result in a saving of over 78 million litres of water each year.  To put this in context, it is the equivalent of saving 31 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year.  From a financial and environmental point of view, we cannot afford to lose this amount of water on a regular basis.  There is no doubt that these works will greatly improve the water supply to Dundalk town, not only for domestic users but also commercial customers who rely heavily on a secure water supply.<\/p>  <p>  Surely it is time for Sinn F&eacute;in and others to take a responsible role in the future of our water infrastructure.  They need to get real and realise that simply playing populist politics with the issue is of no benefit to anyone.  Real solutions are needed which will work and be sustainable.  I look forward to the report of the independent commission which will examine the best way forward for the supply of a safe and secure water network for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to put it on the record once more that, should it be decided by this House that water charges are to be abolished, those compliant taxpayers who have paid their water charges should be repaid in full, with no exception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400042#PP00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1464117900,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on this motion.  In recent times, we have heard a lot of talk about new politics.  When it comes to discussing water, however, it is old politics at their very best.  We see the populism of Sinn F&eacute;in, who are literally wasting time on this particular issue by introducing this motion.  I listened to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's lovely rhetoric about how he is supporting people in the street.  I would like to remind him of his miraculous conversion in October 2014 when Deputy Paul Murphy arrived on the scene in Dublin south-west.  Up to then, Deputy Adams was willing to pay water charges on some of his houses in the North.  I was not quite aware of which house he would pay water charges for, but he was prepared to pay them.  All of a sudden, however, we had a miraculous change of direction.  Populism at its best is what we are talking about here - nothing less.  For Fianna F&aacute;il, it is 1977 all over again, when rates were abolished.  We have suffered the consequences of that ever since.<\/p>  <p>  The main reason Irish Water was established was that the system was not working.  We now need a new system in place to ensure we have water supplies in future.  Those who have been paying up to now have been paying for everything, and they are well aware of that fact.

The new arithmetic of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il allows those of us on the Opposition benches an unprecedented opportunity to have a real impact on Government policy.  Last week, Fianna F&aacute;il proved that with a Bill to address the exorbitant interest rates thousands of struggling mortgage holders throughout the country are paying.  This week, Sinn F&eacute;in has reverted to type.  Rather than come forward with meaningful legislation, it has sought to score political points.  Rather than engage, it has sought to ignore.  From the comfort of the sidelines, the party continues to snipe while others try to come forward with real solutions.<\/p>  <p>  This deeply misleading motion wilfully ignores the progress made on this critical issue in the minority Government arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  No sooner has Sinn F&eacute;in sought a path forward than it dives for cover in the nearest ditch.  The simple fact is the motion has no legal force and requires legislation to be enacted.  That legislation, as a financial measure, must be facilitated by the Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il has secured that in its arrangement.  We have ensured the effective end of water charges, if that is what a majority of the D&aacute;il wishes.  All this has been accomplished through negotiation and compromise.  The motion ignores that progress, and rather than participate, Sinn F&eacute;in chooses to play to the gallery.  In contrast, Fianna F&aacute;il will do its bit in drawing a line under the failed water charges regime and ensuring we have a water network that is fit for purpose.  We will do this with practical actions, not platitudes.<\/p>  <p>  The history of water charges is a sad chronicle of failure by the previous Government.  From the grotesque scale of its &euro;172 million in set-up costs, including &euro;80 million in consultancy costs, to the dizzying series of U-turns the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, underwent in October 2014, it has been a disaster from start to finish.  The then Government implemented more than a dozen U-turns in as many days, entirely undermining its own plans.  The result has been a collapse in public confidence and the failure to pass the EUROSTAT test, the reason Irish Water and domestic water charges were established in the first place.  The water charges figures for 2015, long before the election result, are a testament to the Government's failure.  In 2015, only 53% of bills were paid with annual revenue of &euro;144 million.  A total of &euro;100 million was spent on the so-called water conservation grant, with &euro;41 million spent on administration costs and another &euro;25 million on water meter interest repayments.  On this basis, the State lost &euro;22 million on its water charges regimes in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Recently in the Chamber, Deputy Kelly, as is his wont, tried to grab headlines with wild claims of environmental treason when we had set forward a clear path to end charges.  His claims smack of nothing short of financial illiteracy.  The State is losing money from water charges - at least &euro;22 million last year.  Not an extra cent has been invested in the water network.  I can understand how, after going through the seven stages of post-government grief, the Deputy may have got his figures mixed up.  However, the maths are simple.  Losing &euro;22 million a year to impose a charge that is causing massive political disruption in communities throughout Ireland is financial madness and political stupidity.  His comparisons and those of others with the abolition of rates in 1977 displays the selective amnesia typical of the Labour Party.  He forgets that Fine Gael and the Labour Party in power began the move to abolish rates.  Similarly, 40 years on, their incompetent handing of water charges in power has irrevocably destroyed them as a legitimate charge.<\/p>  <p>  It is now time to draw a line under this issue and move to address the other important challenges we face as a country.  The path forward to end water charges is clear.  Water was only one of a number of pressing issues to be addressed before Fianna F&aacute;il agreed to facilitate a minority government.  However, the party demanded that the issue be resolved in detail or else the Government would have immediately collapsed under motions such as this.  We are committed to ensuring a stable Government and we were not willing to risk that by leaving the issue unresolved and subject to such political opportunism.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of our agreement, as outlined in our amendment, water charges will be immediately suspended for nine months with the opportunity for an extension.  In the interim, an expert commission will report on the best method to fund water services and then a D&aacute;il committee will make recommendations.  Sinn F&eacute;in, I understand, had agreed to the idea of a commission but appeared only to be willing to put one in place once it had decided its conclusions.  The Government will facilitate whatever option a majority of the D&aacute;il endorses.  This is required under Article 17 of the Constitution to accommodate Bills that have an impact on the Exchequer.  In this light, the motion carries no legal force and would require legislation to be enacted.  The result of this agreement and what matters to people is clear: the end of water charges will be decided solely by the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to deal fairly with those who have paid and who have not paid.  Earlier, before he went on \"Morning Ireland \", Deputy Pearse Doherty reached deep behind the couch and found &euro;144 million to repay water charges.  In reaction to an opportunistic Labour Party Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in was not to be outdone and completely reversed its previous position on repayment in the blink of an eye.  Actual policy requires a bit more thought than knee-jerk U-turns and magic money before a radio show.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to equality of treatment for all bill payers.  The issue of whether and how to repay people and pursual of non-payment will be addressed by the D&aacute;il committee.  Ordinary home owners who played by the rules and paid their bills will not be left worse off in comparison with those who refused to pay.<\/p>  <p>  The motion refers to a new public water and sanitation board to replace Irish Water.  It has stated there will be no job losses and, therefore, one presumes Sinn F&eacute;in is looking for a simple name change.  The minority Government arrangement reached with Fine Gael ensures Irish Water will be subject to a new oversight body and will remain in public ownership.  This will keep down costs, help ensure greater efficiency and prevent any privatisation agenda Fine Gael may harbour.  Ultimately, this is what people are interested in, not new names or reorganisation.  If the Oireachtas feels a constitutional amendment is necessary to protect water in public ownership, Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to explore it.  In the first place, we need to clarify the wording of such an amendment having regard to private wells and group water schemes.  Simply putting in place a date without a wording is putting the cart before the horse.  However, I assure the House that water services will remain in public ownership under Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.<\/p>  <p>  We now have a clear route to ending the failed water charges system.  It is in the hands of the D&aacute;il to decide its future.  The motion is simple grandstanding.  However, there is no substitute for negotiation and compromise in bringing forward real solutions.  Water charges are coming to end, our water network is safe in public ownership and we will ensure we have a water network fit for purpose in the 21st century.  I commend the amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400043#QQ00100","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1464118500,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue because it provides the opportunity to address what has been achieved in respect of water charges during the discussions on the formation of the minority Government.<\/p><p>This was a process engaged in by Fianna F&aacute;il so the Government of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il could actually come into being.

Deputy Jonathan O'Brien spoke earlier about the value of his party's motion.  The difference is that we gave people value for their vote when they voted for Fianna F&aacute;il because we actually secured the suspension of water charges.  We now have an opportunity to cut through the waffle and spin and get to the heart of how this service will go forward in the future.  This is something that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n called for when he debated with me on local radio yesterday.  He said that we needed a commission to look at this regime but his constant contradiction of Sinn F&eacute;in's position yesterday, including stating that Sinn F&eacute;in would not repay those who had paid their bills, was incredible.  Rather than acknowledging what has been achieved, what we have seen here this evening is the usual smoke and mirrors from Sinn F&eacute;in which, in presenting its argument, has tried to move the goalposts and repackage the truth.  Deputy Adams knows full well that there was no blocking of water motions here but, again, he is attempting to re-spin the truth on procedural matters in the D&aacute;il prior to the election of Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  If Deputy Adams was serious about this issue, he and his party would have actively engaged during the ten long weeks when parties worked to create this Government, with the notable exception of Sinn F&eacute;in which spent its time sniping from the sidelines.  Deputy Adams spent his time watching re-runs of \"Django Unchained\" and tweeting obscenities.  In that instance lies the clear difference between serious parliamentarians and those who pretend to be - those who come in here and present motions that have no legal effect as opposed to those who recognised that a Government needed to be formed and who secured the suspension of water charges in its formation.  When that D&aacute;il committee reports and comes back before the D&aacute;il, we will all have the opportunity to address the report and vote on the future of water charges or their death.  This clear process is out there in the open and the public knows that.  They know that charges are suspended and they know who secured that.  The problem for Sinn F&eacute;in is that it did not bother to work constructively to see that this Government came into being in the first instance and it now finds itself on the back foot.<\/p>  <p>  People voted for many things in the general election of 26 February 2016 and left us with a divided D&aacute;il.  In achieving the creation of this Government, we have seen the ability to address serious issues no more so than last week when the Central Bank (Variable Rate Mortgages) Bill 2016 was dealt with.  This is an issue that is crucifying people and from our position as the main Opposition party, we presented a clear path to address it.  We also dealt with the issue of adoption, and from our position in opposition, the suspension of water charges because instead of just talking about it, we walked across the floor and actively engaged with Members from Fine Gael who held a different position.  We negotiated to secure the suspension of water charges.  This, of course, is grating to Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  Rather than spin that they are doing something, perhaps they could wake up and actually read what is front of them and realise that Members on these benches faced up to the responsibilities put in front of them and achieved something.  There is a process in which people can engage and I encourage all Deputies to be part of a process that can see the death of water charges.  Sinn F&eacute;in and others should engage in this process and join in making this D&aacute;il work for the people rather than just rehash the same old lines and con the people with the same old rhetoric and tired lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400044#RR00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1464119100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I am delighted that we have an opportunity to discuss it in the House because it has been discussed outside the House for many weeks.

I think this is the right decision and a welcome one.<\/p>  <p>  The water policy undertaken by the previous Government was a failed policy.  It may have been established for good reasons, namely, to invest in the infrastructure that was so badly needed, improve the delivery systems that were needed and ensure we had water quality that was fit for purpose and that we had a wastewater management system that met the needs of a modern society.  Those were all fine principles upon which to try to resolve the problem but the edifice that emerged from the last Government was ill-conceived and poorly thought out and lost the confidence of the Irish people right from the start.  For me, the fateful interview by the chief executive of Irish Water on \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" signalled the death knell of Irish Water as it was.  This was because the establishment of the company under the auspices of Bord G&aacute;is was done on the basis that costs could be reduced and very considerable savings could be made because of the knowledge that already existed in that entity.  Unfortunately, this did not come to pass and we found ourselves with an extremely expensive establishment cost, poor reporting structures, poor formation and a rush to get the project up and running without really focusing on what was being delivered, which was what the public wanted.<\/p>  <p>  Once that confidence had been lost, it was appropriate that somebody would try to resolve it.  I am delighted to be part of a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party that through its negotiations in the aftermath of the inconclusive general election of February 2016 secured the ending of the failed water policy of the previous Government.  It was hard fought for but the outcome was successful and we now have a process that will lead to the end of water charges and the reshaping of water policy that has the potential to deliver on the investment that is needed, the upgrade of the water delivery system and the infrastructure that is needed to treat our wastewater and to ensure that future generations have a water delivery system and a wastewater management system that are fit for purpose.  Much had been said by previous Ministers about the necessity to secure investment from the markets so that we could move more quickly in terms of the roll out of the water infrastructure to ensure we are in a position to attract foreign investment and much-needed jobs because US companies depend so much on certainty in respect of where they invest.  Unfortunately, that did not come to pass when the system that was put in place did not meet the EUROSTAT test.  It is right and fitting that the process that is now underway is the appropriate one.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to be overly political about this but it would be remiss of me not to refer to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I know that Sinn F&eacute;in is not entirely happy that Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition has achieved so much in the past couple of weeks.  We have put that process in place and I can understand that this might be the basis of Sinn F&eacute;in's ill-conceived motion but it is welcome.  It is good to have a debate and an opportunity to talk about it and remind the voters.  I point out to Deputy Louise O'Reilly that to some extent, it is not the first time that Sinn F&eacute;in has been behind the eight ball on this.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin will know more about it than anyone because in respect of his effort get elected in Dublin South-West in light of the work of Deputy Paul Murphy, his arrival in this House was impeded significantly and as a result, Sinn F&eacute;in, rightly, changed its policy.<\/p><p>That is to be welcomed because there is now a greater number of us in the House who are against the failed policy of the last Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400044#RR00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464119700,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The Deputy is sharing time with other Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400045#SS00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1464119700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I do not think there is anybody else, so I will keep speaking for as long as I can.<\/p><p>It is appropriate that Deputy &Oacute; Broin is the one pushing this motion tonight because he the one who has lost so much as a result of Sinn F&eacute;in policy heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400045#SS00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1464119700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Please put him out of his misery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400045#SS00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1464119700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>It shows that when a bright, intelligent guy like Deputy &Oacute; Broin is elected, he is able to bring others with him.

The charges paid by most citizens of the Twenty-six Counties, when they have their bins, water and everything else paid, does not come close to the charges levied in the Six Counties.  Sinn F&eacute;in also suggested the establishment of a commission, which Deputy Cowen has already referred to, to look into water charges, yet now that it is part of what we have agreed, Sinn F&eacute;in decides it is no longer a good idea because it did not get to deal with it.  Much of that has to do with the political jockeying that Sinn F&eacute;in engaged in - or, rather, did not engage in - in the aftermath of the general election.  It spent 70 or 80 days very pleased with its election results and failed to participate in the process afterwards.  That surprises me to some extent because, of all the parties in the House, it has understood processes that have been put in place elsewhere, has benefitted greatly from them and often relies on the necessity to have a process to achieve an ultimate conclusion.  I am talking about the peace process, if Deputy McDonald has forgotten.  Sinn F&eacute;in has sought to pour cold water on what has been achieved by Fianna F&aacute;il from our perspective.  It is a bit disheartening but I am confident that by the time that process has concluded, water charges are eliminated, Irish Water is recalibrated and fit for purpose, and the focus of attention is away from the distractions that have unfortunately bedevilled this entire, sad period in our political time, the focus will be back on getting the appropriate resources and investing them in our water delivery system and in the treatment of our waste water to ensure that we do not have the ongoing and continuous pollution which has been a major inhibitor to our development as a nation.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the work of Deputy Barry Cowen, both as a negotiator and as our spokesperson on water, for the work he has done in achieving so much in such a short period of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400045#SS01400","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1464119700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group is very happy to co-sign this motion alongside Sinn F&eacute;in, Independents4Change, Social Democrats and the other political forces and Independents associated with Right2Water.  This is not a matter of us supporting a Sinn F&eacute;in motion but it is a joint motion tabled in Sinn F&eacute;in time.  We are grateful that Sinn F&eacute;in uses its time in that way.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start with a quote from the ghost of politics past.  The contrast between the demeanour of the previous Minister and this Minister is striking.  There is no difference in the content but in terms of tone it reflects the movement and the knock-back the Government has witnessed.  Over a year ago, the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, said about the movement of non-payment that \"Ruth Coppinger and her band of people [that is the Anti-Austerity Alliance] will lead people up to the top of the hill and then abandon them\".  How did that work out for Deputy Kelly?  Deputy Kelly was abandoned on top of the hill by his people.  The people who participated in the mass movement of non-payment have forced a massive climb down of the political establishment and the biggest defeat for the 1% in this country since the beginning of the austerity era.  Deputy Alan Kelly was not alone in thinking that; he was at one with the entire political establishment and most of the media establishment that the movement of non-payment would be defeated and that everybody would have to pay in the end.  None of them predicted that this would be the key sticking point in the negotiations between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, least of all Fianna F&aacute;il. <\/p>  <p>  What changed?  Who is to be thanked for this, to answer the question that Deputy Cassells asked?  Clearly, Fianna F&aacute;il is not to be thanked.  Fianna F&aacute;il, which introduced water charges into this country, supported water charges and has betrayed its election commitment to end water charges and Irish Water, is clearly not to be thanked.  I also think, to be blunt, that Sinn F&eacute;in is not to be thanked - a party that less than two years ago said it was not a red line issue for it while its Deputies were paying the charges.<\/p>  <p>  Who is to be thanked?  The answer does not lie in this Chamber.  To be thanked is the mass movement of protests that forced fundamental change on a number of political parties and forced suspension of water charges - the mass protests, the electoral expression of those protests in the by-election in October 2014 and the general election and, centrally, the non-payment and the fact that a significant majority of people are now boycotting the water charges.  The lessons are so devastating and clear that it has to be of concern to the Denis O'Briens, the bankers, the bondholders and their political representatives here that when we mobilise together we can win, that the biggest, scariest threats and propaganda from the Government and Irish Water can be faced down and defeated and that mass civil disobedience can work.  It represents a fundamental turning point in Irish politics and the entry of a more confident, more organised, more politicised working class as a part of a broader left and socialist politics.<\/p>  <p>  As a movement, we now have to secure victory on the water charges.  There is a forced tactical retreat at play here.  That is all the commission is about, to maintain the entity of Irish Water and the return in the future of the project of commodification of our water.  We have to make sure there cannot be any return, by achieving the abolition of water charges and Irish Water.  I encourage people to mobilise tomorrow at 5 p.m. outside the D&aacute;il to demand that Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputies McGrath, Halligan, Zappone and the others stick to their election promises and the mandate upon which they were elected and vote with the motion to abolish water charges and Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that water metering is now stopped in its tracks.  The only purpose of water metering is linked to the commodification and privatisation agenda.  It should be stopped in here but if Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il conspire that it is not stopped, protest outside will have to stop water metering in its tracks.<\/p>  <p>  The next point is to demand investment in water infrastructure.  The Government's motion refers to &euro;550 million to be invested in 2016, which is about the average since 2000.  The Government will deliberately under fund water investment so it can come back to us in three or four years' time and say that it told us we needed water charges, to look at the crisis that exists because we have not invested and to demand investment.<\/p>  <p>  We need to say that nobody should be victimised, criminalised or imprisoned for protesting against water charges.  I welcome the fact that Sean Doyle and Eamonn McGrath were released from prison today but I understand that Anna Harvey is still in prison.  We have a vindictive ruling class that is smarting under the impact of a mass movement and a defeat for it.  It is out to get revenge.  There is still very heavy-handed policing of anti-water meter protests taking place.  We also have a ruling class and a 1% that is looking at an era of struggle opening up, not just on water charges but on housing, the repeal of the eighth amendment and the question of wages.  As a result it is seeking to enhance the power of the State and normalise the idea of protesters being imprisoned for being engaged in peaceful protest.  An injury to one is an injury to all.  It is in the interest of everybody to demand that all protesters linked to water charges are released and to demand that all criminal charges relating to anti-water charges protests should now be dropped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400045#SS01500","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1464119700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Debate","time":1464120300,"counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400046#TT00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","time":1464120300,"counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400046#TT00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1464120300,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this topic to be raised.  I had hoped the new Minister for Social Protection would be present to hear this, but I am sure the Minister of State will pass on to him the details of this issue, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  There is a particular problem with community employment, CE, in that the eligibility criteria allowing people to participate in these schemes are far too restrictive.  That could easily be addressed, and it is an issue the new Minister must prioritise because it is tangible and would have a positive impact on the lives of people throughout the country.  I refer to people who currently cannot get on CE schemes, those who must move off them even though there is a huge benefit for them in terms of preparing for employment, and those who may not have progression potential or opportunity depending on the circumstances.  We must also take into account the very positive impact that results from CE.  That is often overlooked by officials in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the societal impact and the positive spin-off in communities are recognised fully by officials when it comes to CE.  In areas in Kerry, for example, where often there are no other employment options, CE workers are doing wonderful work in the community, including working in health care, assisting with child care, working with young people and disadvantaged people, working on the Tidy Towns and so on.  People are doing wonderful work with sporting communities and voluntary organisations that otherwise would not be done.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, the five Kerry Deputies met representatives of Kerry CE schemes in Killorglin.  It is not often that five Deputies would show up to a meeting on a Friday night, but it highlights the importance of this issue and how much we value the work of CE in the community.  Proposals were put to the Deputies to pursue with the Department, and none of the requests were outlandish.  They were reasonable and doable.  I would be very grateful if the Minister of State were to bring back the proposals I will now outline.  The first one is to change the starting point of 2000 to a new starting point of 2015.  That would make far more people eligible for a CE scheme, because anyone who has been on a CE scheme in the intervening period has a reduced opportunity to participate in a scheme in the future.  That is easily done, and I ask the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p>  <p>  Also, with regard to referrals to CE schemes, there is a change in the way progression rates are being measured, and this is not responsive to the needs of communities throughout the country.  The Minister must examine that and change the way the success or otherwise of a scheme is measured.  The current system in place is too black and white and not responsive to the needs of the participants or the groups those people are working with.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing the minimum qualifying age to 21 is something that does not require much explanation, but it would be a sensible measure.  With regard to changing the eligibility requirement from 12 months' unemployment to six months, some people have suggested reducing it to three months or less.  Why should people have to wait 12 months twiddling their thumbs before they can get on a CE scheme?  That type of red tape is making life very difficult for certain individuals.  It could be examined with a view to allowing spousal swops, in that one partner, depending on the circumstances, could participate in a CE scheme in lieu of the other.  We should provide additional financial rewards for lone parents, because there are not enough incentives to participate in CE schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The final two proposals are to change the minimum time on CE schemes to two years in real terms, and to allow people over the age of 62 to participate in schemes.  Those people have very little employment opportunity, yet they are not allowed to participate in CE schemes.  Tweaking is all that is required.  We are not asking for the world, but the needs to be a response from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400046#TT00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1464120300,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brendan Griffin for raising this important issue on easing eligibility for qualification on the community employment scheme.  It is important that we have these debates.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the broader issue, the Department of Social Protection will spend more than &euro;1 billion in 2016 on work, training and education places in support of jobseekers.  Expenditure, and the number of schemes and participants, has increased significantly in recent years in a response to the high levels of unemployment, which peaked at 15%.  The number of places available on work programmes, including CE schemes, has grown from 25,000 in 2010 to just over 39,000 in 2016.  That is a 56% increase.  Schemes such as CE play a significant role in helping jobseekers maintain important work skills.  Erosion of confidence and work skills, including soft skills related to teamwork, communication, planning and so on, is a significant issue over long periods of unemployment.  However, there has been a significant and welcome reduction in unemployment levels.<\/p>  <p>  CE is an employment programme with the aim of helping the long-term unemployed to re-enter the workforce by breaking their cycle of unemployment through a return to a regular work routine.  CE also provides training and development to participants.  The current eligibility criteria for the programme have been expanded over the years.  The criteria have been set to specifically target certain groups for the programme.  The basic eligibility requirement is that a person must be currently in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment such as jobseeker's allowance from the Department of Social Protection for a minimum period of 12 months.  Recent changes to the eligibility criteria for CE include a reduction in the entry age for CE participants working directly with service users in the child care and social and health care sectors to 21 years of age.  The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  The eligibility criteria for participants aged 62 and over have been eased in terms of the maximum duration they can remain on the programme, subject to certain conditions.  Customers who are not eligible for the CE programme may be eligible for other interventions from the Department of Social Protection.  The eligibility criteria for CE are kept under review to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and that there is maximum utilisation of CE places.<\/p>  <p>  I will bring Deputy Griffin's proposals to the Minister.

If the European Union countries, including Ireland, had fulfilled their obligations in the past year, most of those people would not be going into another camp but would be facing a better future.  Sadly, the programme of the EU is about detention and deportation, when it should be about solidarity and service provision.<\/p>  <p>  Last summer, EU member states promised to relocate 160,000 people from Greece and Italy.<\/p><p>Just over 6,200 of those 160,000 people have been relocated.  The European Union's failure to address the refugee problem in a positive way beggars belief.  There is a statistic from the International Organization for Migration indicating that ten people per day have died trying to cross the Mediterranean since 2014.  That means for every 23 people relocated in Europe, ten are dying at sea.  That does not even include those who died on the mainland, suffocating in the back of trucks or getting crushed to death trying to get a lift on or under a truck in Calais or Dunkirk.<\/p> <p> It beggars belief how human beings can treat other human beings.  These people did not choose to be refugees and they did not want to leave their homes, which were bombed.  Much of this started with the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003; we facilitated that by allowing the Americans to use Shannon Airport.  We facilitated it at EU level by supporting the policy of the Americans, French and British military endeavours.  We are not innocent.  How much of an objection did we raise to the EU deal with Greece and Turkey?  It was probably very small.  That deal is a nonsense.  Kurds are being forced back to Turkey from Greece and Turks will shoot them on site.  Turkey is not a safe place for refugees and we should challenge that deal.<\/p> <p> Sadly, we need to seriously rethink our lack of a neutral stance in how the world operates.  We have no problem shaking hands with presidents, kings and other leaders who kill thousands of people but who have no problem smiling for the cameras.  We have no problem doing business with such people.  We can pretend that we care about refugees but we have helped to bomb them out of their homes.  Is it possible we can do a little more?  Could we show that we really care about them?  A couple of weeks ago I pleaded with the Minister to send a team to Calais and Dunkirk to assess unaccompanied minors.  Deputy Clare Daly and I met representatives of the Red Cross last week and it is assessing 950 homes of people who have offered to take in refugees.  It is a no-brainer and it would be a positive step to take.  We might say we will only take people outside Europe or Syria but it does not matter who they are.  They could be Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis, Sudanese or Yemeni.  We need to help these people.  The Irish have gone all over the planet and we got help everywhere but now we do not want to help these people.  Europe may want to pretend everything is going to be okay and the problem will go away, but it will not go away.  More refugees will come this year than came last year, and more people are drowning in the Mediterranean in 2016 than did in 2015.<\/p> <p> There are many complications involved in bringing people to this country and I am not saying this is black and white.  We are not making a good effort but we could.  That would make such a difference.  It would bring a bit of credibility to us as a nation if we played a much stronger role.  Ireland and European countries in general are not playing a strong role right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400046#TT00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464120900,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue this evening.  I am here on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who cannot be here tonight.  This area overlaps with the responsibilities I have with respect to issues of refugees and immigration.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in that Europe is facing its greatest migration and refugee crisis since the Second World War.  There is no doubt about it.  Conflicts and instability, including in some states in Africa and the Middle East, have led to more than 60 million displaced persons globally.  Against the backdrop of this humanitarian crisis, record numbers have sought to reach the European Union, often, as the Deputy noted, undertaking desperate and perilous journeys across the Mediterranean and Aegean seas at the mercy of ruthless and exploitative people smugglers.  The European Union has collectively taken concrete steps to address the crisis and measures have been adopted in support of Italy and Greece, which jointly received more than 1 million migrants and asylum seekers last year alone.<\/p><p>On 10 September 2015, recognising that we do not face the same migratory pressures as many other member states, the Government voluntarily agreed to establish the Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons in total under the European Union's resettlement and relocation programmes.  Under this programme, Ireland is prepared, willing and ready to receive people.  The mechanism by which the balance of the 4,000 people is to be admitted will be determined based on future developments at EU level.  It is expected these numbers will be augmented further by family reunifications.<\/p><p>The figure of 4,000 people includes approximately 2,600 asylum seekers to be admitted from Italy and Greece under the EU relocation programme and 520 refugees, which the Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  Ireland is well advanced in fulfilling our commitments on resettlement, with 263 refugees admitted to date from Lebanon and the balance expected to arrive by the end of September, also from Lebanon.<\/p><p>The pace of the relocation programme across the European Union has been slower than we would have wished.  If greater numbers are made available by the Greek authorities, we will be in a position to process greater numbers in line with our commitments.  The T&aacute;naiste and her Department have already provided four experts to support the implementation of the programme, with two in Italy and two in Greece.  They are open to providing further assistance upon request.  We have also nominated liaison officers to both Italy and Greece to support our identification of relocation candidates.<\/p><p>A Syrian family of ten has been relocated from Greece to Ireland and granted protection.  Very shortly, another group of 31 Syrians will arrive in the State.  A further 40 people are provisionally scheduled to arrive the following month, with a regular intake of between 40 and 60 persons arriving every eight weeks by agreement with the Greek authorities.  Ireland and other member states are working with the Italian authorities to try to overcome the impasse regarding proper security clearance procedures in line with the commitments already endorsed by this House.<\/p><p>To break the dangerous business model of people smugglers and remove the incentive to seek irregular routes into the EU, the EU-Turkey statement agreed by the Heads of State or Government on 18 March outlined a number of clear action points for implementation.  To support the implementation of this agreement, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has nominated six international case work experts to the European Asylum Support Office to assist the Greek asylum service in the implementation of the admissibility procedure and performance of vulnerability checks.  In addition, Ireland has also offered the services of two members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to support the establishment of appeals committees.<\/p><p>The Deputy also referred to the closing of the refugee camp in Greece.  It is my understanding that no official camp exists in Idomeni.  Exploitative people smugglers have encouraged desperate asylum seekers to congregate on the Greek border with Macedonia by spreading misinformation to suggest the border crossing will soon re-open and allow them continue their journey to destination countries, including Germany and Sweden.  The Deputy pointed out that the conditions where many vulnerable women and children have gathered are unsanitary and unsafe.  I understand from Greek authorities that their intention is to move asylum seekers to reception centres, where their needs, including food and medical care, may be adequately met.<\/p><p>The crisis is likely to stay high on the agenda for the foreseeable future, unfortunately.  Our naval vessel, the <i>LE Rois&iacute;n<\/i>, is also assisting the Italian navy in the operation of humanitarian rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea.  The Deputy knows that other ships have also operated in the area.  In addition to our existing commitments to provide protection to asylum seekers and refugees who reach our shores, Ireland is also working with EU partners to develop legal pathways for migration into Europe and to engage constructively with countries of origin and transit.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400047#UU00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Incidence","time":1464120900,"counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400047#UU00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1464120900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>With a few short words, I express the concerns of the people of Cobh, who are currently reading a recent study by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland indicating that the rates of prostate cancer there are 71% higher than the national average, with female breast cancer incidence 38% above the norm.<\/p><p>The people of Cobh are very concerned.  While he is in the House, I congratulate my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, on his new position.  I know he has spoken on this issue and expressed concern about it in the past.<\/p> <p> I raise this issue because when the National Cancer Registry was asked for a reason that the rates are higher in Cobh, it stated that it could be down to the issue of social deprivation.  I do not believe that is a proper answer when asked a question of that nature.  We know that Cobh is a town with a history of heavy industry, that there is a remediation programme going on at the moment in an area in which heavy industry is no longer located and that the Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring the pharmaceutical or pharmachem industries in the lower harbour areas.  However, we do not have actual clean air monitoring at specific reference points throughout the Cobh area and there is no live reporting to the public.<\/p> <p> It could be beneficial if a baseline study were instigated for Cobh and a full investigation could be carried out.  This could be done without necessarily putting an extra charge on the Exchequer because there is a number of stakeholders, such as GPs and UCC, in particular, which have addressed the strategic policy committee of Cork County Council, that is, the environment committee.  The department of chemistry and the environmental research unit have stated that they would be happy to conduct studies in this area.  It is an issue that affects every family in Cobh.  Professor Colin Bradley, a professor of general practice, stated recently: \"I've seen more cancers in surprisingly young people than I would in previous practices\".  He is referring specifically to Cobh.  I believe it is an issue that is worthy of further investigation.  I do not accept the social deprivation answer that has been given by the National Cancer Registry.  We laud the work it does but we need some empirical evidence.  It would appear that there is an intergenerational increase in the rate of cancer, not only prostate and female breast cancer, but also in other areas.<\/p> <p> I am asking the Minister at least to consider facilitating some stakeholder engagement on this issue.  I am not necessarily looking for a cheque for a baseline study but if we can get a favourable response from the Minister to the idea of putting together some sort of stakeholder group involving UCC, which has stated that it would be willing at least to partake in further studies on this issue, then we could seek to deliver something for the people in Cobh, who are gravely concerned about the matter.  I am asking the Minister to have an open mind.  I will leave him with one metric.  If one looks at the 1994 to 2007 figures, the urban area of Cobh had a 37% higher incidence than other parts of the country.  That would mean that within that timeframe, someone in Cobh was diagnosed with cancer every 11 days.  I thank the Acting Chairman and hope I will receive a favourable reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400047#UU00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1464121500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on the incidence of cancer in the Cobh area in County Cork.  As the Deputy asked, I will keep an open mind but I will now present him with the information I have been presented with.  I want to reassure the Deputy and the people of Cobh that there is no newly published report setting out higher rates of cancer in the Cork area.  The National Cancer Registry is the statutory agency with responsibility for the collection and analysis of data relating to the number of cancer cases.  Analysis conducted by the cancer registry for the period 1994 to 2007 indicates that Cobh urban had a higher cancer incidence rate than the national rate and the Cork County rate.  However, the data also indicated that Cobh rural had a lower incidence rate than the national rate over those years.  While there is a number of possible reasons for these differences, it is important to acknowledge that cancer incidence is reported as average figures and that there will always be local variations above and below the average.  This is particularly true when looking at a small population area, such as Cobh, relative to the national population.<\/p>  <p>  In 2008, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commissioned an independent report on the site conditions at Haulbowline.  The assessment involved analysis of all likely contaminants to determine whether there was a threat to human health or the environment.  The report concluded that: \"Based on the monitoring works completed it is concluded that there are no identified risks to the residential inhabitants of Cork harbour associated with the presence of waste materials at the East Tip on Haulbowline Island.\"  In light of the conclusions of the 2008 report, it was decided not to conduct a baseline health survey for the Cork harbour region at that time.<\/p>  <p>  There is a number of reasons variations may exist in cancer rates.  The primary factor is age.  While it is unfortunate that some people are diagnosed with cancer earlier in life, cancer is predominantly a disease of ageing.  Lifestyle issues such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise, unhealthy diet and excess body weight are risk factors.  It is internationally accepted that up to one third of cancers can be prevented by improving these modifiable risk factors.  My Department is currently working on a new national cancer strategy for the next decade.  This will build on the progress made through the implementation of the two previous strategies.  Areas of focus are likely to include prevention, early diagnosis, further improvements in treatment, rare cancers, survivorship and high quality, patient-centred care.  I intend to publish this new strategy in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  I am looking forward to the implementation of the new strategy and to making a further significant improvement in our efforts to prevent cancer and to deal effectively with it when it does occur but on the basis of the issues Deputy Sherlock has raised, I will ask that my Department reflect on the points he has made and that it revert back to me.  Any future decision in respect of a baseline health survey would have to be taken in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which is set to be renamed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400048#VV00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","time":1464121500,"counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400048#VV00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1464121500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and invite him to visit Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, County Louth, at the first available opportunity.

Deputy O'Dowd referred to the work to rule which is about the major deficit of 104 whole-time nursing posts in the hospital.  It has one of the highest trolley numbers in the country.  This is a hospital that is expected to deliver safe services with a complement of what the IMO has said is three staff to a ward when there should be five staff in those wards.  Not alone is such a service putting patients at risk, it is also an additional stress on the overworked existing staff.  The fact that 52 of the 104 positions are for permanent vacancies shows this is not just a problem for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital but applies equally to the many other health centres, units and hospitals throughout the country.  Recruitment problems of this magnitude cause problems with patient care.  Too many staff are being asked to work in excess of contracted hours which also puts patients at risk.

In direct response to Deputy Munster's question, the first thing I am going to do is stop playing party politics with the health service, and that is why I received Cabinet approval today to move ahead with the motion - which I understand Deputy Munster's own party and indeed every party in this House feels very strongly about - to set up a cross-party committee to meet within six months to look at a single vision for a single tier public health service and how we are going to fund that.  I look forward to constructive ideas on that measure.<\/p>  <p>  I regret that a decision was made to undertake industrial action in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda following the breakdown of talks at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, last Friday on resolution of the staffing difficulties at the hospital.  I believe that the interests of patients are always best served through negotiation and by avoiding industrial action.  Industrial action, even if it is limited to non-core duties, is not in the best interests of patient care and cannot resolve the staffing issues.  Nonetheless, I take the point made by Deputy Munster about caring professionalism and I am sure it is not a decision any nurse takes lightly.  I am pleased, therefore, that the INMO and the HSE have accepted an invitation from the WRC to attend a meeting tomorrow to discuss the issues.  I welcome this progress and this recommencement of talks.  I am satisfied that the issues raised by the INMO can be best addressed through engagement at the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the hospital is implementing a contingency plan to minimise, in so far as is possible, the impact of the industrial action on patient care.  The emergency departments will remain open over the course of the industrial action in an effort to continue to meet patients&rsquo; emergency medical needs.  Unfortunately, the contingency plan included cancelling all planned, non-urgent elective procedures today other than cancer related care.  Patients whose appointments are affected were contacted directly by the hospital and a new date will be re-scheduled as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I want to correct the impression that there is a recruitment embargo at present.  This is not the case and there is no blanket embargo on recruitment.  While there has to be compliance with national pay structures and management of employment numbers within budget in the HSE, there is scope for hospitals to continue to recruit, particularly across key departments such as intensive care units, theatre and emergency departments.<\/p>  <p>  Our Lady of Lourdes recognises the need for ongoing recruitment drives due to the movement of staff across the HSE and to other health care services in Ireland and abroad.  To date, 34 nurses and midwives have been recruited to the hospital this year and 21 staff nurses are in the process of being recruited.  At present there are two campaigns of particular relevance: a Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group competition and an initiative to offer all nursing graduates of 2016 the opportunity for permanent nursing posts.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has continually increased staffing levels since the beginning of 2015.  By the end of March 2016 overall health service employee numbers had increased by 5,856 whole-time equivalents, the vast majority in front-line positions.  During that 15-month period from January 2015, the numbers employed in acute hospitals increased by 3,500 whole-time equivalents, with nursing numbers up by more than 1,700 whole-time equivalents during the same timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputies that the Government is fully aware of the difficulties and challenges.  I am due to meet the INMO tomorrow to discuss nursing issues in general and I look forward to engaging constructively with it and to continuing the very constructive role it plays in co-chairing the emergency department task force as we all work together as stakeholders to try to address the issues facing our emergency departments and hospital staff, including nurses and midwives, in delivering care.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to continue to grow the health budget as the economy improves and to obtain the resources necessary to improve working conditions for front-line staff to enable us to deliver the level of service that we all want to provide to our patients.  I wish to put the health service employee numbers on the record in this House.  While it does not always fit the political narrative, the numbers are the numbers.  I absolutely accept there is still some way to go to get back to the numbers of front-line staff working in our hospitals before the recession but it is important to note that the numbers have continued to increase since December 2013.  At that time, there were 47,934 people working in the acute sector.  In December 2014, that figure had increased to 49,742.  By December 2015, it had increased to 52,539.  In March 2016, that number stood at 53,253.  With regard to nurses, including midwives, at the end of 2014 there were 34,211, which rose to 35,036 in March 2015 and to 35,918 in March 2016.  Since December 2014, there has been an increase of 1,707 nurses, which is a 5% increase.  Since March 2015, there has been an increase of 825, which is a 2.5% increase.  There is significantly more to do but it is simply not correct to put the narrative out there that nursing numbers and front-line staff are declining when in fact the opposite is true.  Deputy O'Dowd's invitation to visit Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is absolutely something I would like to take up and I look forward to visiting shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052400049#WW01000","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1464122100,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 May 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
