Consistent with this principle, the Action Programme gives a clear commitment that, in future, the functions of government at local level will be performed through the local government system to the greatest possible extent.  This approach is consistent with the recommendation regarding local government in the &#8220;Take Charge of Change&#8221; Declaration, as are measures to strengthen the role and powers of local government, which is a core objective of reform. Government policy decisions in this regard are set out in the Action Programme. Additional local government functions are specified with particular regard to three key areas: the operation of the local micro-enterprise support service through Local Enterprise Offices; local authority oversight and planning of local and community development programmes; and an enhanced and clearer role in economic development. These decisions represent the most significant enhancement of the role of local government in many decades.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, in the course of drawing up the reform programme, Ministers were requested to identify further matters that could be devolved to local government. Initial proposals arising from this process are detailed in the Action Programme. There will be further engagement with a view to identifying additional activities ahead of the development of legislation to implement reform measures.The Action Programme also provides for delegation of greater authority to local level in functions such as environment, water, foreshore, roads, traffic, housing and energy efficiency. This involves giving greater responsibility or discretion to local authorities in relation to various areas in which they already have a significant involvement and where there is scope for reducing the degree of central control. The Action Programme also addresses the issue of citizen engagement and public participation in local government and indicates that mechanisms to promote greater community and citizen engagement with local government will be considered, including possible participative democracy arrangements.<\/p><p><br \/>  An essential component of the Action Programme will be the development and enactment of legislation. Wide-ranging and detailed legislation will be necessary to provide for a range of measures contained in the reform programme. This will include provision for amalgamation of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, including the dissolution of existing authorities, the establishment of new unitary authorities, and the transfer of functions, assets, liabilities, staff, etc., from the existing councils to the successor authorities. Wider legislative provisions will also be required to provide for new arrangements at sub-county and regional levels, together with likely consequential amendments across a number of other legislative codes and to allow for the implementation of a range of new policy undertakings under the Action Programme.  The local government reform programme is a high priority for Government as a key element of the overall reform agenda, and while I am not in a position to provide definitive timing details for the legislation, it will be brought forward for enactment in good time before the 2014 local elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Security of the Elderly","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[54203\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount of money spent in each of the last five years on the seniors alert scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The aim of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to support independent living for those over 65 , and of limited means, who live alone or who live with a person who is also over 65 years of age.

It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a Local Property Tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU\/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a Household Charge in 2012 as an interim measure.

Consistent with the Government&#8217;s commitment to equity across tenures, I will not incentivise one form of tenure over another but rather will seek to enable all households to access good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has already taken a number of steps in this regard. The emphasis in the social housing programme in recent years has shifted from highly capital intensive modes to more flexible delivery models. In this regard the introduction of the social housing leasing initiative and the rental accommodation scheme have served to deliver more housing units more speedily to service the needs in this sector. They have simultaneously served to absorb some of the overhang in the housing rental market, and their continuing deployment will further serve to relieve pressures for people in this sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, my Department has had on-going engagement with NAMA in order to provide units for social housing and a Steering Group comprising my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs) towards achieving this objective. While progress to date has been slow this is due in the main to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints. I hope that the recent establishment by NAMA of a Special Purpose Vehicle, to facilitate the leasing of units, will ensure speedier delivery of a social housing dividend from NAMA&#8217;s operations.  Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered, of the units identified by NAMA for consideration for social housing, to the end of September 2012 demand has been confirmed for over 1,300 available units and these are currently being processed.<\/p><p><br \/>  Data from the Central Statistics Office show that during the 2006 &#8211; 2011 inter-censal period the residential rented sector grew by 47% and its share of the overall housing market grew from 22% to 29%.  The single biggest component of the rented sector is households rented from private landlords which, in 2011, numbered more than 300,000 tenancies.  The <i>Residential Tenancies Act 2004<\/i> provide s for security of tenure for tenants, minimum obligations for landlords and tenants, and the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to operate a system of tenancy registration and dispute resolution. The 2004 Act also contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and procedures for rent reviews. It specifically prohibits the setting of rent above the market rent and provides both tenants and landlords with the right to a review of rent, which review may not take place more frequently than once in each period of 12 months nor in the first 12 months of the tenancy.  I have no plans to introduce any further measures in relation to rent control at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nuclear Plants","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[54230\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will advise on any possible risk factors that may be brought about by the decommissioning and cleaning up of Sellafield; his role in monitoring this process and protecting the environment and persons in exposed areas of the east coast of Ireland due to the difficulty that has arisen out of what has been regarded as the historic neglect of the plant in recent reports by the UK National Audit Office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>In 2008 arising from contacts at Head of Government level, a confidential technical information exchange project relating to the Sellafield Site was established, with the cooperation of UK authorities. Through this process, an assessment of the potential risks to Ireland posed by the Sellafield Site and the nearby Low-Level Waste Repository was undertaken on Ireland's behalf by a Team of independent, international experts. The project included site visits by the Team to Sellafield where they were given the opportunity to examine various facilities, access extensive documentation not previously released, and interact with local staff and management. This enabled the Team to develop reliable, accurate risk models and calculations. The work on this project has now been completed and last week a public summary of the assessment was released, and is available on my Department's website at .<\/p><p><br \/>  Based on the results of this Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), the key finding of the Team was that an incident at Sellafield or the nearby Low-Level Waste Repository (LLWR) causing the release of radioactive material would result in no observable health effects in Ireland. Possible scenarios, or combinations thereof, considered by the PRA Team in reaching this conclusion included natural phenomena including earthquakes, meteorite strikes and incidents such as airplane crashes, terrorist attacks, explosions, fires, and human error. The PRA also found that some severe incidents at Sellafield\/LLWR have the potential to create significant socioeconomic impacts in Ireland, such as loss of tourism and markets for Irish seafood and farm products because of concerns that radioactive materials may be present, despite monitoring data confirming that all food for sale or export complies with limits set to protect consumer health. The Department will now study the Report and use it to feed into Government policies relating to Sellafield and nuclear policy in the UK. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors routine operational discharges from Sellafield, and also monitors developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety generally, and keeps the Government informed of their potential implications for Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  I welcome the recent publication of the Report by the UK &#8217;s National Audit Office (NAO) <i>Nuclear Decommissioning Authority &#8211; Managing risk reduction at Sellafield<\/i>.

Ireland must continue to be vigilant in relation to Sellafield as work to decommission the site over the lifetime of the &#8220;Sellafield Plan&#8221; continues. It is critical from an Irish perspective that the UK decommissioning of the site is undertaken safely and in accordance with best international practice.

The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009-2012 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website: <\/p><p><br \/>  While there is no reference in the Regulations to a lower income limit threshold for mortgage applicants, the associated credit policy provides a procedure for calculating the maximum amount of mortgage repayments permissible as a percentage of the household income. Local authorities are advised to examine each application on its own merits in determining whether an applicant is eligible for a house purchase loan. It is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased since the credit policy was introduced. However, it is also clear that the loans issued under that credit policy are more likely to be fully performing.  I consider that the current arrangements for mortgage lending are fair and adequately meet the needs of prospective home owners in a prudent manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme, the terms provide that rent charged on the local authority&#8217;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&#8217;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude early next year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[54185\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400059#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total amount of money reduced from local government fund payments per local authority area due to their payment rates of the household charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose grants.  General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third and fourth quarters of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 29 November 2012 some &euro;111.2m had been collected nationally.  A reduction of some &euro;15.7m was applied to the third quarter general purpose grant payment. In the final quarter of the year those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% or above have not had a further reduction in their general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% have incurred a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% have incurred a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.  For those authorities with a collection rate below 65%, and thereby incurring a further reduction in quarter 4, the final amount of general purpose grants available for 2012 will be revisited and reviewed at end year to take account of the financial position at that stage, including progress on securing an increased household charge yield.

Registration facilities have been available since 26 June 2012.  I have no plans to amend the date specified in the legislation.<\/p><p>Since June 2012, a public awareness campaign, which included the nationwide delivery of an information booklet to unsewered households, has helped to inform owners of domestic waste water treatment systems of their legal obligations to register their systems and to operate and maintain their systems so as not to cause a risk to human health or the environment. Prior to inspections commencing in 2013, an extensive information campaign to advise householders of how to comply with the legal requirements regarding operation and maintenance of on-site waste water treatment systems will be undertaken.<\/p><p>As of 29 November, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 226,156 owners, who have registered on-line, by post or in person at their local authority offices, have been processed. I understand that more than 60,000 registration applications are awaiting processing by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  In total, therefore, some 290,000 householders have already applied for registration of their waste water treatment systems.  Census 2011 recorded that there are 497,281 households served by septic tanks or other treatment systems in Ireland.<\/p><p>Details of the numbers of processed registrations for each County and City

Countryside Council) where the implementation of the priorities of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS) is discussed and progressed. This strategy sets out the main policy and strategic objectives to be achieved over time and provides a focus for the delivery of outdoor recreation facilities and services.  In addition, the development of such facilities and services provides a significant boost to local communities by encouraging both national and international activity tourists. Consequently there are enhanced opportunities for rural communities to benefit from local enterprise development and enhanced opportunities for small scale businesses.<\/p><p>  The significant development with regard to the implementation of policy in this area has been a change in the contractual arrangements with the Local Development Companies (LDC) contracted to deliver the Walks Scheme. The Walks Scheme is closed to new entrants due to budgetary constraints. However, the LDCs are now also contracted to deliver on the implementation of the NCRS in extended geographic areas.  This means that some companies now provide services over the full county area and some provide advice and support to adjacent counties also.  The change in focus from the delivery of the Walks Scheme only to the delivery of the full range of outdoor recreation opportunities and activities will further enhance the attraction of our rural areas and accelerate developments in all areas of recreation.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently in negotiations with other State Agencies to agree a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland. The Department continues to be a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors. It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibly in the outdoors and to do their part to protect  lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.  A Pilot Mountain Access Scheme is being implemented.  It is intended to facilitate access to uplands for hill walking and similar activities.  A pilot project has been developed at Mount Gable in Connemara and discussions are continuing towards extending another proposed pilot project for Carrantuohill to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks in County Kerry. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently supporting the State Claims Agency in the establishment of a Visitor Safety in the Countryside Group who will use best practice to aim to achieve a safe and pleasant experience for outdoor enthusiasts and visitors to the countryside.  The possibility of implementing a National Indemnity Scheme  is also being examined; while the Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, this would indemnify all private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 90 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[54205\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position in regard to the future development of an adequate and reliable domestic drinking water supply with particular reference to sourcing of supply, purification, storage and transmission; if it is expected to realise the required objective in this regard in the short to medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[54550\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to proceed with the upgrading of existing domestic water supply networks such as the replacement of defective pipelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 411 together.<\/p><p>  The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives. The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.  The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.<\/p><p>  The development of the programme followed a comprehensive review of investment requirements initiated in 2009 involving an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services by each water services authority and taking account of reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.<\/p><p>  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs. There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment. In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure. An implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water has been finalised. This strategy takes account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition, that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects and that a sustainable funding model is put in place to support increased investment in the sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Issues","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[54250\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400060#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on whether the draft NSAI pyrite testing and categorisation protocol will increase the cost of inspections; and if this will lead to categorisation of more damaged houses as amber and delay the necessary remedial works at a time when the structural guarantee liability period is running out for money of the home owners.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>In its report the Pyrite Panel recommended that an industry expert group be established by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to develop an Irish testing protocol capable of determining whether there is reactive pyrite in the sub-floor material and if it has caused pyritic heave.

To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &#8364;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &#8364;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition <font color=\"#FF0000\">. <\/font>In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received twelve applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded status to four bodies. The Agency has approved five applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &#8364;13.4 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2013, under this Scheme, with more approved housing bodies applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&#8217;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA.<\/p><p><br \/>  No funding restrictions have been placed on local authorities for the purposes of providing loan finance for house purchase or home improvement. Allocations totalling over &#8364;55m issued to local authorities for House Purchase and House Improvement lending in April 2012, an increase of 8% on the 2011 allocation of &#8364;51m. These allocations represent borrowings ceilings rather than financial provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[54242\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of families currently engaged in the process with their mortgage lenders which will allow them to take up the mortgage to rent scheme; the number of families that are currently in the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.<\/p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. The transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.<\/p><p>  The level of ambition for next year under mortgage to rent and the prospective associated mortgage to lease arrangements will be determined largely in the context of the Estimates process for 2013. It will be essential to deal with any potential displacement effect for other categories of social housing need arising as a result of the wider roll-out of mortgage to rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":138,"content":"<p>Question No. 113 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[53759\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC01900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the groups or organisations he has met in the past 12 months who were victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland including the name of the group or organisation and the date on which the meeting took place.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[54369\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC02000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the areas of work which the Northern Ireland Section of his Department has supported him in relation to matters relevant to Northern Ireland.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[54370\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400061#WRC02100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the process through which the Northern Ireland Section coordinates north-south cooperation through each individual Government Department including the nature and outcomes of coordination of north-south cooperation undertaken by each Department.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 119 and 120 together.<\/p><p>  I refer to my response to question numbers 1 to 19 in the House on Tuesday, 20 November, 2012 in which I gave a comprehensive account of the meetings I have had with the families of victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland in the last 12 months.

Pension benefits for those who were members of the scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary.  The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme.  The NTMA contribution to the scheme is determined on the advice of an independent actuary and is at present set at a level of 25% of payroll in respect of members prior to 1 January 2010 and 10.5% of payroll in respect of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010.<\/p><p>  Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.  Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme.  The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1\/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.<\/p><p>  In relation to the pension entitlements of the Chief Executive of the NTMA, his contract provides that his pension will be based not on his salary as Chief Executive but on his salary as a director of the NTMA prior to his appointment as Chief Executive.  The pension of the Chief Executive of NAMA will ultimately be based on a pro-rata average of his final salary as NAMA Chief Executive and his final salary as an employee of the NTMA.  He was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of NAMA on 22 December 2009 and his contract as NAMA Chief Executive is a specified purpose contract, linked to the lifespan of NAMA.<\/p><p>  The Chief Executives of NTMA and NAMA have waived 15% of salary through the gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under Section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Gifting of a proportion of salary to the Exchequer under this provision does not affect the calculation of pension benefits.  The salary of the Chief Executive of NTMA for 2011 was &euro;490,000 before the voluntary reduction.

This amount will have to be repaid over time, mainly from annual instalments on the promissory notes.

The overall average increase in the effective rate for the income range &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000 is ultimately decided by the distribution of income earner numbers in the range.

In addition, the Revenue Commissioners advise that they hold meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow\/hidden economy activities are evaluated.  Furthermore, the Commissioners advise that they are willing to meet with any party interested in passing on specific insights into tax evasion, and that all such information received will be followed up on, but for reasons of confidentiality Revenue will not be in a position to provide any specific feedback on information received.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two recent examples are the introduction of a more robust Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400063#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":303,"content":"<p>Question No. 170 answered with Question No. 144.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400063#WRE04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400063#WRE04150"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[53768\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400063#WRE04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the annual pension in payment paid to a former Assistant Chief Inspector of his Department (details supplied)","asker":"1008","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is personal information and its disclosure would amount to a breach of the Data Protection Act and therefore I cannot supply the information as requested.

Unless there is a rapid response to the request for additional funding credits for 2012 which the Commission adopted on 23 October, the Commission will start 2013 owing reimbursements of about &euro;220 million to the national agencies for the expenses incurred in 2012.  The Commission's intention was to reimburse this backlog from 2013 funds, thereby at least securing funding for current and further Erasmus mobilities in early 2013. This would, however, come at the cost of further depleting 2013 funds, setting the scene for substantial and real problems in the second half of the year.&quot;<br \/>  To date, the Irish national agency is not aware of any immediately damaging impact on Irish participation levels.

Armagh is delivered as soon as possible.  A report on the joint inspection of the Centre by the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate and the Education and Training Inspectorate found that the quality of the provision which they evaluated was outstanding. It was found that the Centre is meeting very effectively the needs of the young people, their peers, parents and professionals and has demonstrated its capacity for sustained improvement. Both Education Ministers have welcomed the report as a strong endorsement of the valuable work being carried out by the Centre.<\/p><p>  Educational UnderachievementThe Educational Underachievement Working Group (EUWG) met on 4 September 2012 to review and advance its work programme. The Working Group reviewed progress on the production of a joint report by the two inspectorates on best practice in literacy and numeracy in post-primary settings and the potential for a similar publication on good practice in supporting those with special educational needs. The EUWG approved a proposal by Children's Books Ireland to encourage young teenagers' involvement in reading. Both Departments supported Maths Week 2012. Discussions between officials of the respective Departments are taking place on the sharing of best practice on attendance and retention.<\/p><p>  Teacher MobilityA joint report has been prepared by the two Teaching Councils on the island concerning outstanding issues and obstacles to teacher mobility.

Its aim is to promote reconciliation and to help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland. It funds a wide range of projects from small activities funded under Local Area Peace Plans to the iconic Peace Bridge over the River Foyle.<\/p><p>  The Interreg IVA Programme (2007-2013) is a &euro;256m cross-border programme co-funded by the EU Union.  The Programme aims to promote economic and social well-being in the eligible region, Northern Ireland, the border counties of Ireland and parts of western Scotland.    The Programme encompasses projects in the enterprise, tourism, health, rural development, public sector collaboration, energy, information and communications technology, energy and transport sectors.<\/p><p>  The Special EU Programmes Body anticipates that both Programmes will be fully committed by the end of the year.  Both Programmes are overseen by Progamme Management Committees, comprised of government departments, local representatives, community and voluntary sector and social partners.

I would stress that discussions on new EU programmes and funding are ongoing in Brussels in the context of the negotiation of the Multiannual Financial Framework and that final decisions have not yet been made.

Public service pensions awarded from March 2012 onwards, while not subject to the PSPR, are also subject to a significant effective reduction, reflecting the full impact of the pay cut of 1 January 2010 and, where arising, other pay cuts.

The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing with issues that would include:<\/p><p> - Thresholds: In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill.<\/p><p> - Adjudication:  This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.<\/p><p>  When these and a number of other issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage early in the New Year.  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector.  Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK00650"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[53835\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"in respect of the October Exchequer returns, the reason the capital spending for his Department was &euro;16m below profile for this period; his plans to ensure that the full capital spending is implemented before the end of the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has a capital allocation for 2012 of &euro;103.75m.

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Departments and Agencies, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region.  A key area of engagement at official level between my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland (DETI) is our joint support for enterprise projects for both sides of the border region under the INTERREG initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by DETI.  Both Departments are represented on a Steering Committee to consider project proposals.  We have provided significant financial support towards a number of North\/South projects, including enterprise networking and capacity building initiatives for the border counties and Northern Ireland and several other enterprise development projects.  The assessment process for remaining projects under the current programme is on-going and officials from both administrations are also engaged in a process which will hopefully see a new INTERREG scheme initiated, when the current phase expires in 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  Another key area is our on-going dialogue with our counterparts in DETI in relation to the operation of InterTradeIreland (ITI), the North\/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body.  ITI is co-funded by my Department and DETI and so all matters relating to the management of the Body and the planning and oversight of its schemes and programmes, involve close interaction by the officials of both Departments.  Specifically, this engagement involves agreement on the key themes of ITI&#8217;s programmes which must be aligned with national strategies.  The engagement also includes key aspects of corporate governance and financial control, including ensuring that value for money and efficiency savings are applied to ITI programme activity.  This requires officials to engage very frequently throughout the year, to address issues that arise in relation to these requirements. A range of formal oversight arrangements are in place.  In addition, the Secretary General\/Permanent Secretary of both Departments met the ITI Board recently for a general economic discussion and to overview the on-going operations of the body.<\/p><p><br \/>  Enterprise Ireland (EI), which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  EI North-South programmes and activities include <i>Bridging the Border<\/i> Seminars\/partnering events.  These events are designed to promote joint opportunities between firms North and South in areas such as licensing and commercial agreements, sub-contracting, technical co-operation and business partnerships.  In addition, clients of Invest Northern Ireland (INI) can participate on EI programmes such as <i>Leadership4Growth<\/i> and the <i>International Selling Programme<\/i>.  Since 2006, clients of both agencies can access market services, trade missions, overseas offices, trade fairs, seminars, market development programmes etc., provided by each agency.  The all island <i>Innovation Voucher<\/i>   initiative, jointly launched by Enterprise Ireland and INI, provides Irish SMEs with access to a further 10 knowledge providers based in the North, and allows Northern Ireland  based SMEs to use INI Innovation Vouchers to access expertise in research institutions based in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  An example of close agency cooperation is the <i>Acumen<\/i>   programme, a key all-island business development programme managed by InterTradeIreland and supported by Enterprise Ireland, INI, F&Aacute;S, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and the County Enterprise Boards.  The Programme is designed to stimulate cross-border sales and coordinate development amongst SMEs, North and South, to establish and build market presence in the other jurisdiction.  This is an excellent example of all relevant bodies coming together to drive enterprise development in the region.<\/p><p><br \/>  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now<\/i>   initiative, developed to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor.  The focus has been on developing compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, and make the region more attractive for investment.  More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  To ensure cohesive integration of the relevant activities of the two Departments, and the key Agencies in both jurisdictions, we organise an annual meeting involving my Secretary General, the Permanent Secretary of DETI, with the CEOs and Chairmen of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, to discuss a variety of North-South strategic issues.  My Department officials, and the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to increase mutual economic benefits, especially on job creation.  In addition, officials in the Employment Rights area of my Department meet on a regular basis with their counterparts in the Department of Employment and Learning to exchange views on matters of mutual interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"County Enterprise Boards Funding","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK03550"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[53814\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide details of the overheads and total budgets, including the spend on mentoring and soft supports, direct grant aid, staff and administration costs including overheads, for all city and county enterprise boards since 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>County Enterprise Board (CEB) Capital Expenditure is solely for the purpose of providing financial assistance in the form of grant aid and non-financial assistance (soft supports) in the form of mentoring, training and advice to clients.

The drawdown of exchequer monies through the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department is based on commitments made in a given year and projected draw-downs against those commitments in the year in question. It must be remembered that drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies (e.g. Competency Centres) is demand-led and can only take place if the company or body in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State at the time of the financial commitment.  In addition, there are other timing issues around finalising legal agreements with the private sector when setting up funds, for example under the Innovation Fund initiative, which means that while drawdown will take place, it may be pushed back by some months, thereby showing up as an &ldquo;underspend&rdquo; in a particular accounting period.<\/p><p>  Due to this demand-led nature of grant payments and issues relating to the timing of expenditure, the bulk of an allocation is often drawn down in the last quarter of the year.

There is also an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process, together with long-established dispute settling institutions that play an important role in disputes relating to collective bargaining.  The Government is committed in its Programme for Government to reform the current law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p>  In a related issue, earlier this year the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organisation issued a number of recommendations arising from a complaint referred to it by ICTU and IMPACT.  The ILO, noting the commitment in the Programme for Government on collective bargaining, invited the Government, in full consultation with the social partners, to review the existing framework and consider any appropriate measures, including legislative, so as to ensure respect for the freedom of association and collective bargaining principles set out in its conclusions - including through the review of the mechanisms available - with a view to promoting machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; organisations for the determination of terms and conditions of employment.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the ILO report did not find Ireland to be in breach of its obligations under ILO Conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights. Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair judgement would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition.  The established procedures can be improved and secured without creating a new statutory obligation on employers to recognise trade unions for collective bargaining purposes.  It is envisaged that adequate protective measures such as appropriate prohibition of the victimisation of trade union members and of incentivisation of persons not to be members of a trade union would be important elements of this system.  Giving effect to this commitment will require consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004.  This consultation process will be initiated in the near future.  I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile our constitutional, social and economic traditions, and our international obligations, as well as ensure continued success in attracting investment into our economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in the Workplace","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04150"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[53920\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the options or advice for workers who are being bullied in their employment and where management do not act.","asker":"1017","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>Every employer has a duty under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of their employees and to manage and conduct work activities in such a way so as to prevent, as far as is reasonably practicable, any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees at risk.  Equally, the 2005 Act also places obligations on employees in relation to their duties not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour likely to endanger their own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of bullying in the workplace, the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work 2007, published by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which operates under the auspices of my Department, is aimed at preventing and dealing with bullying where it happens in Irish workplaces.  It is a &ldquo;Code&rdquo; for both employers and employees and is available to download from the HSA&rsquo;s website at www.hsa.ie.  A significant element of the Code places an emphasis on the resolution of incidents of alleged bullying using an informal process and professional mediation services.  The Code also reflects the legal requirement that employers carry out a risk assessment, and where bullying is identified as a hazard, they ensure that it is included in the safety statement.<\/p><p>  The role of the HSA under the Code is to monitor if employers and employees are meeting their obligations and duty of care under the 2005 Act.  In this regard, if an employer refuses to carry out an investigation into an allegation of bullying for no reasonable reason, the HSA may ask the employer to carry out such an investigation, or, depending on the case, may request that some other form of safety, health and welfare control mechanism is put in place.  Where an employee is dissatisfied with the outcome of the internal procedures there are options available to have the dispute referred to an outside forum, such as the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) who can provide a mediation service on request where both parties are willing to engage. Such mediation is a voluntary, confidential process that allows two or more disputing parties to resolve their conflict in a mutually agreeable way with the help of a neutral third party.  The service is provided free to the parties.<\/p><p>  The employee also has the option to take a complaint to the Rights Commissioner Service under the Industrial Relations Acts.  Prior to the complaint being heard by a Rights Commissioner, however, it is possible that the case may be considered suitable for intervention by the recently established Early Resolution Service (ERS).  The ERS is a conciliation\/mediation type service of the Workplace Relations Customer Service which is provided by Case Resolution Officers (CROs).  The ERS provides a prompt intervention which will initially involve contacting the parties, or their representatives, to secure their agreement to participate on a voluntary basis in early resolution. Using telephone and email communication the CROs will explore possible avenues of settlement in a non-prejudicial fashion.<\/p><p>  Where the complaint proceeds to a full hearing by a Rights Commissioner under the Industrial Relations Acts, the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation will not be legally binding and can ultimately be appealed by either party to the Labour Court.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service provides information to parties on how to bring a case before its services.  It is, therefore, open to a person (or persons) who claims that he\/she is being bullied in the workplace to seek advice from the Health and Safety Authority in terms of their entitlements to work in a safe workplace, and\/or to pursue a formal bullying complaint through the industrial relations services of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04350"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[53972\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400068#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 302 and 303 of 21 February 2012, when he will introduce the Statutory Instrument to give effect to Article 19 of the Consumer Rights Directive limiting credit and debit card surcharges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":568,"content":"<p>My Department issued a consultation paper on the implementation of Articles 19 and 22 of the Consumer Rights Directive on 6 September 2012.

Work has already commenced on this Strategy, and initial consultations have taken place with key stakeholders.

To achieve these objectives, EI has in place a range of direct supports to assist established client companies including those in the Construction sector. EI maintains a network of offices to ensure it reaches out to support entrepreneurs and established companies throughout the country.  A dedicated unit within Enterprise Ireland - the Potential Exporters Division &#8211; is responsible for responding to the development needs of such companies; promoting and advocating the export agenda; proactively promoting a range of tailored services, initiatives, and grants; helping companies access EI services and financial supports; proactively identifying and stimulating companies that demonstrate the potential to grow and establish a developmental agenda with those particular companies.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the Government&#8217;s &#8364;2.25bn infrastructure stimulus package should provide significant opportunities for job creation in the Construction sector.  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Department of Education and Skills is currently carrying out a review of the apprenticeship model.  To assist redundant apprentices complete their apprenticeships, that Department, through F&Aacute;S, has put several interim measures in place, including the development of Phase 7 (equivalent) assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stone-laying, Cabinet Making and Plastering.  Redundant apprentices who wish to complete the Phase 7 equivalents should contact their Senior Training Advisor.<\/p><p><br \/>  F&Aacute;S has also introduced a Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM). This Mechanism provides redundant apprentices who have a time deficit in their apprenticeship, with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge against the occupational standard for the specified trade over a number of days in a F&Aacute;S Training Centre.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the temporary Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme (RAPS), F&Aacute;S provides supports for apprentices to be placed with an eligible employer in order to attain the minimum duration necessary to complete their &#8220;on-the-job&#8221; training at Phases 3, 5 or 7 of the apprenticeship.  The maximum period of placement is 26 weeks for apprentices on Phases 3 and 5; and 12 weeks for those on Phase 7.  Redundant apprentices may also avail of Skills Training Courses which enhance their employment skills, as well as the range of Night Courses which are available in F&Aacute;S Training Centres.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. <\/p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. <\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. <\/p><p>  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.

The Pathways to Work approach involves the following:<\/p><p> -  More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were over 87,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in the first eight months of 2012.<\/p><p> - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p> - Various initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. The most prominent schemes in this regard are the Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Initiative. At October 26th 2012, there were 23,747 participants on the Back to Education Allowance scheme, with 91% previously on a jobseekers&#8217; payment. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months.

The Department will continue to implement its powers to sanction individuals who fail to engage with the &#8216;Pathways to Work&#8217; approach.

This represents very significant progress in a short period of time. <\/p><p><br \/>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP (National Employment Action Plan) will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time<\/p><p><br \/>  I wish to advise the Deputy that circa 42% of those joining the live register exit within the first three months.  Therefore, a reduction in the JobBridge eligibility period could be seen as potentially interfering with normal labour market conditions.  Furthermore, it may be seen as discouraging newly unemployed individuals from seeking jobs in the normal manner.  The recent interim evaluation report conducted by Indecon confirms that 66.9% of JobBridge participants were unemployed for over six months while 38.1% of this sub-group had been unemployed for over a year prior to commencing their JobBridge internship.  Given that the long-term unemployed have particular difficulties in securing employment, this is an important aspect of the JobBridge scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would further advise the Deputy that the interview and selection process is entirely a matter between a Host Organisation and its potential interns.  Thus, the facility exists whereby a Host Organisation could propose a start date to coincide with their selected candidates&#8217; fulfilment of this eligibility criterion.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is anticipated that a final report will be published by Indecon in late December.

The remainder of the jobseeker's allowance recipients (9,085) are in receipt of a weekly rate that reflects either their means or family circumstances.  A detailed breakdown of the 47,855 recipients by age and rate is set out in the tabular statement below.<\/p><p>The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  The &euro;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:<\/p><p>- claimants with a qualified child;<\/p><p>- those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;<\/p><p>- those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;<\/p><p>- those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance;<\/p><p>- certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.<\/p><p>A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.<\/p><p>Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.

There are currently in excess of 745,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.  The scheme provides free travel on the main public services such as Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail and Luas as well as services provided by over 90 private operators.  The previous Government froze expenditure on this scheme in 2010 and it has remained at almost &euro;76 million since then. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently rolling out a public services card that will be used to access all social welfare entitlements.  The card will act as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.  A variant of the public services card will be issued to free travel customers which can be scanned or read electronically on the public transport network through the integrated ticketing scheme environment or as a pass that can be shown to the bus driver.  A pilot of the public services card using the free travel variant is currently being developed in the Department for roll-out next year.  This will facilitate the collection of more complete data on the operation of the scheme.<\/p><p>  The cross-border free travel scheme has been in place since July 1995, initially facilitating cross-border bus or rail journeys free of charge between the two jurisdictions.  Since April 2007, the all-Ireland free travel scheme enables all seniors resident in all parts of the island to travel free of charge on bus, rail, air and ferry services participating in the travel schemes in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  There are considerable challenges ahead to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports provided by my Department which impact in some way on the lives of almost every person in the State.  As part of the deliberative process for the budget, my Department reviews all schemes.  Any changes will be announced in the upcoming Budget.<\/p><p>  An interdepartmental review for the free travel scheme is currently being carried out with a view to ensuring that the scheme operates in a sustainable and cost effective manner.  I appreciate that the free travel scheme has played a major role in preventing the social isolation of elderly people in Ireland, but it is important to review the operation of it to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose.

The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, The National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &#8211; 5th October 2012) stated that the extent of employment among JobBridge participants is also seen to rise as the length of time since internship completion increases. As a consequence, Indecon found that 52% of all finishers to-date were now in paid employment.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  It is expected that the progression outcomes in respect of those &#8216;under 25&#8217; would be broadly in line with the 52% figure.<\/p><p><br \/>  A further breakdown of progression into employment by age category will be provided in the final Evaluation Report.

The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service&#8217;s activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for:<\/p><p> - Transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach.<\/p><p> - More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were over 87,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in the first eight months of 2012.<\/p><p> - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p> - Incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed.<\/p><p> - Creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  One such measure is the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and referral to training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options. In terms of job search assistance, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter\/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again).  Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font> For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers.  The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods &#8211; and this will include targeting young people at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p><br \/>  Through the registration and referral process, young people access a wide range of programmes aimed at supporting them in their job search and increasing employability.  For example, over 12,000 young people were trained on the main F&Aacute;S programmes for unemployed people in 2011, while a further 1,700 benefitted from a specific measure for redundant apprentices.  Almost 5,000 previously unemployed young people went back to further or higher education with financial support under my Department&#8217;s Back to Education Allowance scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, there are a number of schemes\/programmes available that are focussed on work experience<b>.<\/b>  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme.  Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes.  The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600.  Young people also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Placement Programme","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN00950"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[54111\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"he number of young graduates who have taken part in the work placement programme; if they have been successful in gaining further employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>The Work Placement Programme was announced by Government on 27th May 2009.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in October 2000 on behalf of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Work and Pensions, the Permanent Secretary, Department of Social Development and the Secretary General, Department of Social and Family Affairs (now the Department of Social Protection).  The purpose of the MOU is to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness and integrity of our mutual social security systems.<\/p><p>  A Management Committee was established to oversee the workings of the MOU.  The Committee comprises senior officials from Departments of Social Development, Social Protection and Work and Pensions and it assists and directs activities of the Cross Border Operational Forum, which deals with operational activities.  Through the MOU and the work of the Operational Forum, considerable benefit has been derived by the parties through sharing of best practice in counter-fraud operations and highlighting awareness of new developments.  In addition under the MOU, procedures have been implemented to ensure that all information requests and data exchanges are made through a single point of contact in each jurisdiction.<\/p><p>  Over the past number of years, fraud detection systems in border areas have been refined and enhanced and are subject to continuing review.  A range of measures are employed by the  Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised.  The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit works with other agencies such as Revenue, National Employment Rights Authority, Customs and the Garda&iacute; and ensures that control activity is being targeted at high risk categories of claimants\/employers.  There is an active and on-going relationship between the Department&rsquo;s SIU officers and their counterparts in the Fraud Investigation Service in Northern Ireland.  The Deputies will appreciate that due to operational sensitivities, the Department is not in a position to release information regarding the specifics of control activities that target cross-border fraud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN03050"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[54166\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal for invalidity pension in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and when a decision may be made on same.","asker":"1058","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal, by the person concerned, was registered in that office on 11th September 2012.

Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage. <\/p><p>  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration. The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.<\/p><p>  The outcomes delivered by the Employment Services from the Intreo Centre Tallaght are as follows:<\/p><p> - 3,500 customers assisted into various training opportunities<\/p><p> - Engagement with 117 companies through the Jobsbridge initiative<\/p><p> - 893 persons assisted with Technical Employment Supports Grants<\/p><p> - 350 persons assisted with payments from the Technical Assistance Training Fund<\/p><p> - 27 persons assisted through the Work Subsidy &amp; the Employment Subsidy Schemes. <\/p><p> - 182 persons assisted through the Work Placement Programme<\/p><p> - Approximately 200 persons will receive assistance through the Activation Family Support Programme by the end of 2012<\/p><p> - 489 persons on the Back to Education Allowance; 160 Back to Work participants and 128 Systematic Short Term Workers.<\/p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region. Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places. The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas. The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  Some 420 persons have been assisted towards participation on the Tus programme in the greater Tallaght area.<\/p><p>  Specifically to the greater Tallaght area, Community Services provide funding to:<\/p><p> - 25 CE schemes serving the greater Tallaght area, with a total of 578 places contained within these schemes.<\/p><p> - There are 5 Jobs Initiative programmes which provide 94 permanent jobs.<\/p><p> - There are 3 Jobs Clubs presently operating in the Tallaght area (which assist persons with interviewing skills, CV preparation, contacts with employers)<\/p><p> - Jobs Clubs operate for a set period of weeks for each group of persons, and have a capacity to engage with circa 400 persons per annum in the Tallaght area.<\/p><p> - The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p> - Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.<\/p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.

I will, of course continue to closely monitor expenditure trends across all my Department&rsquo;s subheads in the lead up to year-end to ensure the greatest possible use of the resources available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":761,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 341 and 342 answered with Question No. 339.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":762,"content":"<p>Question No. 343 answered with Question No. 338.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":763,"content":"<p>Question No. 344 answered with Question No. 339.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO02850"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[54148\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO02900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will outline projects which the Department cooperates with the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure in the North.","asker":"1080","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[54281\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 931 of 18 September 2012, the position regarding an application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[54389\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO03100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the nature, process and outcomes of North-South cooperation undertaken by Waterways Ireland and an Foras Teanga.","asker":"1066","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[54390\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the nature, process and outcomes of North-South cooperation undertaken within the areas of the arts, culture, museums, galleries and commemorations.","asker":"1066","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[54391\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the nature, process and outcomes of North-South cooperation in relation to built and natural heritage and other environmental matters.","asker":"1066","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 to 349, inclusive, together. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is committed to supporting North\/South co-operation, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement. As the Deputies will be aware, there are two North South Implementation Bodies under my Department's remit: Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga (comprising two agencies - Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency\/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch). The Implementation Bodies carry out a range of activities in line with their statutory remits and supported by funding from their two sponsor Departments - my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Waterways Ireland, the largest of the North South Implementation bodies, is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.  It has responsibility for approximately 1,000km of navigable waterway and, in 2007, Waterways Ireland&#8217;s remit was extended by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) to include responsibility for the restoration of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Foras na Gaeilge has a range of responsibilities regarding the Irish language, including facilitating and promoting the development of the language on an all-island basis, while the Ulster-Scots Agency has responsibility for the development of the Ulster-Scots language, including the promotion of greater awareness and use of the language and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Bodies operate under the policy direction of the NSMC and the two Governments, and are accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the Ministers of the sponsoring Departments. Further information on these North South Implementation Bodies can be accessed on the following websites: ; ; .   <\/p><p><br \/>  I should say that I and officials of my Department are in regular engagement, both formally and informally, in exploring ways to enhance cooperation across various areas of our remit. In this regard, I - along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr Dinny McGinley, TD - meet with Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, on a regular basis. Our next formal engagement will be at the NSMC meetings in Inland Waterways and Language sectoral formats on 12 December next in Armagh.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the language and inland waterways sectors, there are a number of other areas of my Department's operations which also come within the remit of DCAL.  These include arts, culture, museums, galleries and commemorations, as well as cooperation in relation to the built and natural heritage, and environmental matters.  I am engaged directly with Minister Ni Chuil&iacute;n on programme development and planning for commemorations, especially those relating to the 1912-1922 period.  The larger commemorative events in Northern Ireland this year have been arranged at community level.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is represented on the East Border Regional Biodiversity Forum which is a cross-border initiative launched in June 2011(part-financed by the EU European Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG IVA Cross-border Programme managed by the Special EU Programmes Body). Action for Biodiversity is a 3 year project which aims to deliver a regional and cross border Biodiversity Framework for the East Border Region.  <b><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  My Department provides funding for collaborations between museums on either side of the border, as well as projects which seek to enhance, celebrate or commemorate the artistic, cultural, musical, film or heritage of the island of Ireland.  Projects funded include:<\/p><p> - The Cinemagic Young Peoples Television and Film Festival, that has run successfully for many years in Belfast and since 2008 has also been held annually in Dublin;<\/p><p> - The Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland, established in 1995 as a means of bringing young people from different cultural backgrounds and communities together using music as a form of dialogue.  The orchestra is made up of young people aged 12 &#8211; 24 years from counties North and South, from as far apart as Cork to North Antrim.  The orchestra undertakes cross border and cross community collaborations and provides music education and performance programmes for up to 7,000 children annually.<\/p><p> - The Cinemobile cross-border project, a mobile cinema lorry that tours Ireland showing movies in areas that do not have a cinema.  Cinemobile carries out a project that involves the twinning of a number of schools, North and South.<\/p><p> - My Department has also provided funding for the provision of a Cross-Border Cultural Broker to assist in the success of Derry UK City of Culture 2013.  The Cultural Broker has responsibility for Arts and Regeneration.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is ongoing cooperation between the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council\/An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on for a number of years and a joint annual plenary is held where they discuss and manage common strategic commitments.  The Irish Film Board also has ongoing co-operation with Northern Ireland Screen in respect of film funding. In that regard, two new films &#8220;Jump&#8221; and &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; that are jointly funded by both bodies will be released next year.  The Culture Night initiative, which launched in Dublin in 2006, has been extended to many towns, cities and counties across the island of Ireland and the 2012 Culture Night, which took place on 21 September 2012, included participation by 6 regions in Northern Ireland.  If the Deputies are interested in receiving more specific information on any particular project or area of co-operation, I would be happy to provide it on request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[54423\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n taighde at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag a Roinn faoi na deacrachta&iacute; oideachas&uacute;la a chruth&oacute;dh athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gCaighde&aacute;n gach seacht mbliana.","asker":"1028","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[54424\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"maidir lena mholadh i mBille Choimisi&uacute;in Thithe an Oireachtais, an eol d&oacute; t&iacute;ortha eile ar domhan a bhfuil r&eacute;imis seacht mbliana acu idir athbhreithni&uacute; ar chaighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il a dTeanga N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, n&oacute; c&eacute;n taighde teangeola&iacute;ochta a bhfuil s&eacute; ag brath air a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn gur mar sin at&aacute;.","asker":"1028","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p>Freagr&oacute;idh m&eacute; Ceisteanna Uimh. 350 agus 351 le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p><p>  Mar is eol don Teachta, foils&iacute;odh an Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il den ch&eacute;ad uair i 1958.

My Department and local authorities have prioritised the examination of the present and future workforce demographic in the context of service delivery, organisational diversity, knowledge transfer, up-skilling\/re-skilling and succession planning.<\/p><p>  To support the sector in effectively managing the combination of staff reductions and the reform\/change programme a Workforce Study has been undertaken jointly by local authorities and my Department.  In particular, the study assesses the management requirements of local authorities bearing in mind the potential impacts of shared services and other reform initiatives underway.  Each local authority is in turn preparing a detailed workforce plan outlining how it will implement the study&rsquo;s recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge Collection","counter":845,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":846,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[53899\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the latest registration figures by local authority area of the household charge and the respective target figures for compliance in each local authority area.","asker":"954","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":847,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the Household Charge. Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge.  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service\/agency basis for all county and city councils.<\/p><p>The target is to maximise the yield from the Household Charge in all areas.

The compliance rate from local authority to local authority varies considerably, however, from 85% in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown to 55% in Donegal.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to use the provisions of the legislation, combined with their local knowledge and judgement, to increase compliance.  I expect that local authorities will use the available avenues to the fullest to help fund the services which are important for the wellbeing of every household and community.  The legislation empowers local authorities to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and local authorities will pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings where it is considered appropriate.  I urge all liable persons who have not paid the Charge to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears. Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<\/p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme specifically, the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway. I will shortly publish material on my Department&rsquo;s website, in furtherance of the review, and this will facilitate stakeholder consultation which is likely to take place early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":925,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRRR02050"},{"type":"question","counter":926,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[54304\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRRR02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason local authorities do not have to make the details of their own planning applications available online as it the case with other planning applications; if he will agree that they should be available for viewing on line and that quite often such applications are of great public interest as they often relate to public works, road realignments and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":927,"content":"<p>Section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and the associated Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, set out the legal requirements in relation to local authority own development which does not require environmental impact assessment.

The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however, lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.<\/p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub - prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme.

The Directive sets legally binding limit values, and target values for a range of pollutants and requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring is conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of permanent and fixed-term air quality monitoring stations located around the country, reporting the results on its website at: <font color=\"#0000FF\">. <\/font> Monitoring includes the following pollutants: nitrogen oxides; sulphur dioxide; carbon monoxide; ozone; particulate matter (PM<sub>10<\/sub> and PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>), ozone, benzene and volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  The EPA publishes also an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2011 &#8211; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality<\/i>  , was published in September 2012 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2011, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. <\/p><p><br \/>  No exceedances of EU limit values were recorded for 2011 and downward trends have been identified for many pollutants. However, levels of particulate matter (PMs) are a concern, especially where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on bituminous coal does not apply. To maintain good standards of air quality and ensure that, in the future, air across all Ireland will be healthy and clean, local authorities must continue to enforce the ban on bituminous coal with improved effectiveness. Air quality could also benefit significantly if households used more efficient methods for space heating by shifting from solid fuel to cleaner, more efficient alternatives; this would also have additional climate benefits by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Following public, industry and local authority consultations, I introduced revised and updated solid fuel regulations to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential solid fuels. Under the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 which were given effect in August 2012,<\/p><p> - most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p> - seven new towns are being added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p> - a prohibition on the burning of bituminous or smoky coal was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution. <\/p><p><br \/>  The new regulations will ensure that the ban continues to be effective in maintaining good air quality standards in our cities and towns, protecting human health and the environment.  Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2<\/sub>) levels in larger urban areas, derived mainly from road traffic, have remained relatively static since 2002, with signs of a slight increasing trend in the years 2008-2010. Further reductions of NO<sub>2<\/sub> levels will require improved emission standards from new vehicles, reduced demand for private road transport, increased use of alternatives to the private car such as cycling, walking and public transport.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS01100"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[54557\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he hopes to be in a position to provide adequate funding for local authorities in the coming year notwithstanding the economic difficulties he inherited from his predecessor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":963,"content":"<p><i>The Action Programme for Effective Local Government - <\/i><i><i>Putting People First<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>  reinforces local government as the primary means of public service delivery at local level.

Guidance issued by my Department in relation to the involvement of Councillors on SPCs states that every County\/City Councillor should, as a matter of equity and good practice, have the opportunity to serve on an SPC and that SPC Councillor membership should reflect the proportionality and the distribution of elected representation on the full Council. This guidance goes on to state that the allocation of SPC chairs should also reflect equitably the spread of   elected representation on the Council. The purpose of these guidelines, which acknowledge the difficulty in legislating fully for such good will and practice , is to ensure that the various political and other interests represented on the full   Council are treated fairly, and equitably represented in the SPC system.     <\/p><p><br \/>  In implementing the <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government &#8211; Putting People First<\/i>, chairs of SPCs and the Corporate Policy Group (CPG) will continue to be filled pro-rata, based on the size of the relevant groups within the Council. Membership of the CPG will be extended to include leaders of party or other groupings (where these are not already members by virtue of being chairs of SPCs) to ensure that the strategic guidance of SPCs reflects the political balance of the Council.  In view of the current arrangements and their continuance in implementing <i>Putting People First<\/i>, I do not propose to prescribe any methodology, including the D'Hondt method, which could have a negative impact in ensuring an equitable spread of elected representation on local authority committees and their chairs as between representatives of political parties and independent councillors .

The shared objective of the project was to provide an established co-operative process for sharing information and addressing any technical issues arising. This represented a significant advance in addressing Ireland&#8217;s long-standing concerns about Sellafield. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government engaged a team of independent technical experts that included nuclear physicists, chemists and engineers. The expert team brought specialist knowledge and expertise which is not readily available within the Irish Government system due to the absence of a nuclear power generation or reprocessing industry here. The function of the team was to conduct a comprehensive, objective and scientific assessment of the technical information on Sellafield and its associated facilities made available from the intergovernmental exchange project. The key output is a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) report of the risks to Ireland and Irish interests from incidents at the Sellafield nuclear site.<\/p><p><br \/>  The team paid a number of site visits to Sellafield, examined various facilities, accessed extensive documentation, and conducted a number of technical exchanges with operators at the site and with UK regulators which enabled the team to develop reliable, accurate, risk models and calculations. The expert team used additional sources of information such as their own knowledge of operating history and data from similar nuclear facilities around the world to make expert judgments.   <\/p><p><br \/>  On completion of the project, the team produced a 1,000 page main report. A public summary document was released as the team recommended that the full report should not be published because to have such a substantial volume of security-sensitive information in the public domain would serve to increase the risks posed by Sellafield to both the UK and to Ireland. This 4 year project cost &#8364;4.8m gross, or &#8364;4.0m net of VAT. As the team&#8217;s brief was explicitly to assess the risks posed to <i>Ireland<\/i> from Sellafield, the UK did not meet any of these costs, though the UK would have incurred its own costs through, for example, facilitating the information exchange and hosting site visits.   <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and others will now study the information in the report in detail and use it in the context of Government policies relating to Sellafield and the nuclear sector more broadly. Ireland must continue to be vigilant in relation to Sellafield as work to decommission the site over the lifetime of the &#8220;Sellafield Plan&#8221; continues. It is critical from an Irish perspective that the UK decommissioning of the site is undertaken safely and in accordance with best international practice.  The finalisation of this report marks the improved information sharing process that has developed between the Irish and UK Governments since 2008. Particularly given our status as a non-nuclear country, Ireland looks forward to continued timely sharing of key information with the UK authorities in the future on nuclear matters, including Sellafield and the UK nuclear new-build programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[54581\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in order to facilitate smaller parties, if he will consider increasing the number of councillors representing each local authority on regional authorities.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>The Action Programme for Effective Local Government: <i>Putting People First<\/i>, which I published in October 2012 following Government approval, sets out the Government&#8217;s decision regarding new arrangements at regional level.

There are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. As it happens, September and October are the peak months for registrations in the State primarily as a result of students beginning or returning to their studies. In recognition of this, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges. Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students.<\/p><p><br \/>  This year these arrangements were extended into November. Naturally, at particularly busy periods and not withstanding the special arrangements put in place, there may be occasions when, based on the numbers seeking to register and estimated processing times, processing capacity is reached for that day and persons attending beyond that point are asked to return at another time. This is simply a matter of managing demand on the day in a  sensible, proactive and safe manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The increase in the fee in respect of the issue of a registration certificate under the Immigration Act, 2004 came into effect on 19 November, 2012. Any person issued with a registration certificate from that date will be required to pay the new fee of &#8364;300 unless they come within those categories exempted from the charge. In respect of persons who may have been seeking to obtain a re-entry visa, I should point out that the fees for same have not changed.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: <\/p><p><br \/>  - UN Convention Refugees;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996; and<\/p><p><br \/>  - Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.<\/p><p><br \/>  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &#8364;3.2 million in fees waived.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is an unavoidable consequence that people seeking to register will fall on the either side of the fee increase introduction. It is understandable too that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) rising to exceptional levels at certain times. <\/p><p><br \/>  For the sake of completeness, I should also add that the cost of various services to immigrants here compares favourably with other jurisdictions and that, in particular in respect of student immigrants, the fee charged for immigration services is, in the great majority of cases, a small proportion of the overall fees they are required to pay the supplier of educational services. I would point out that this is the first increase since 2008 and that the fee increase itself will be used to defray some of the costs of providing and developing enhanced services to migrants.<\/p><p><i>The following information was provided under Standing Order 40A.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>The main issue that gave rise to the difficulty on the day in question was physical capacity in the office which deals with immigration registration which is performed by civilian employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p><br \/>  At an early stage of the day in question, it became clear that physical capacity to the office to deal with applications had been reached and indeed exceeded.  Because of this a number of applicants were turned away and advised to return on the following week - at which time of course the fee increase had come into effect.  It is not possible to say with complete accuracy how many people were in this category but the Garda&iacute; estimate that it may have been in the region of 60 people.  I am also advised that this number is likely to include people who had other immigration related business on that day which was unrelated to registration.<\/p><p><br \/>  Having reflected on the matter, in addition to turning these applicants away and requesting them to return on another occasion, it would also have been appropriate to take their details so that upon their return a lower fee could have been charged to them.  In saying this, I think it is important to acknowledge that everyone acted in good faith and made their best endeavours to deal with a huge increase in the volume of callers to the office where this business is conducted.<\/p><p><br \/>  While clearly there will always be difficulties in circumstances where fees are being increased where some will inevitably fall outside the cut off point, nevertheless it should be possible to put in place some arrangement to deal with the type of situation which occurred in this instance. <\/p><p><br \/>  Accordingly, I have requested my officials in conjunctions with the Garda National Immigration Bureau to devise a system which would to the greatest extent possible avoid a recurrence of such a problem.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the meantime, I would like to apologise to the individuals in question for any inconvenience caused to them.  It is not possible to independently identify such persons so therefore they cannot be refunded the additional fee charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":1003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1004,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[53728\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRS05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is enough in the Coroner&rsquo;s Act to deal with the death of a person (details supplied) and if this legislation needs updating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1005,"content":"<p>Under the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation of the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.

Persons who receive civil legal services are generally obliged to pay a financial contribution.<\/p><p><br \/>  The criteria for qualifying for civil legal aid are set out in sections 24 to 29 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 &#8211; 2006. In summary, the financial eligibility threshold at the moment is that a person&#8217;s disposable income must not exceed &#8364;18,000. Disposable income is calculated by taking a person&#8217;s gross income (the Board does not treat certain State payments that are made for the benefit of another person as income) and deducting certain allowances. The main allowances are an allowance for a spouse, each child, child care costs, rent or mortgage, income tax, PRSI and USC payments. There is also a capital threshold for eligibility.   disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, small claims and defamation.  There is a general &#8216;merits&#8217; test for getting legal advice and a more specific test for getting legal aid (representation). Legal aid can only be granted for matters before the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice. In addition the Minister for Justice and Equality may prescribe any other court or a tribunal for the purpose of making legal aid available. The only tribunal that has been prescribed to date is the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  At present, I have no plans to change the qualification criteria for civil legal aid.<\/p><p><b>  Criminal Legal Aid<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  This is purely a discretionary matter for each court and is not governed by any financial eligibility guidelines.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.<\/p><p><br \/>  An applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  Such an offence carries a penalty of a fine or imprisonment or both.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Also, it must be borne in mind that Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  It is with due regard to these clear rights that any criminal legal aid scheme must operate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Officials of my Department are developing a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid, including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  As currently drafted, the Bill will regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse. The transfer of responsibility arrangement to the Legal Aid Board reflects the practice in other jurisdictions where one agency deals with all aspects of legal aid and where it is thereby possible to bring a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of all of the legal aid schemes.  There is still a significant amount of work to be done in developing the Bill but I would hope that it would be possible to publish it during 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will also be interested to know that the fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme have been subject to three separate reductions over the past few years and some structural changes were also introduced to the fees payable in the course of 2011.  To date in 2012, expenditure is &#8364;46.16 million which represents a welcome decrease of approximately 10% over the same period in 2011.  A number of measures aimed at achieving greater efficiencies in criminal proceedings are being implemented in collaboration with the relevant agencies and with cooperation from legal practitioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":1015,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1016,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[53776\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence Istanbul Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1017,"content":"<p>As I stated in my reply to PQ No. 51818\/12  of 21 November, 2012, Ireland supports, in principle, the aims and terms of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.

In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Bill provides for the modernisation and reform of the way legal services are provided in the State along with the more independent regulation of the legal professions and greater transparency and competition in relation to legal costs. The Bill, therefore, gives legislative expression to the commitment given in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.<\/i>It supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery as a specific deliverable under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding while also taking account of recommendations made by the Legal Costs Working Group and by the Competition Authority. The Competition Authority has published reports on several of the professions in addition to solicitors and barristers - for example, on doctors and dentists - and these other professions are outside my remit as Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Defence.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Deputy Broughan's question on legal costs, the Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. For the first time, these cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs. Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the accountability of the two legal professions is to be enhanced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill, it is not accurate to contend that there are no &quot;independent procedures and penalties operated by the Law Society of Ireland&quot;. Under current law the Law Society is, in fact, bound by the conduct regime of the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011. In particular, Part 3 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act of 1994 makes detailed provision for the investigation of complaints against solicitors. The Society&#8217;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints lodged directly to the Law Society by members of the public. A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles such a complaint may, under the current legislation, then refer the matter to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (also appointed under the Solicitors Acts)   at any time within the three year period immediately following the Society&#8217;s decision.<\/p><p><br \/>  Complaints about professional misconduct may also be made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  Even where a complaint of misconduct has been made to the Law Society in the first instance, it may also be referred by the Society to the Tribunal.  The members of the Tribunal, which includes lay persons, are appointed by the President of the High Court. Where there is a finding of misconduct, the Tribunal can impose a sanction on the solicitor ranging from admonishment to a direction to pay restitution of a sum not exceeding &#8364;15,000 to any aggrieved party. In more serious cases the Tribunal may refer its finding and recommendation to the President of the High Court who ultimately will decide on the nature of the sanction to be imposed on the solicitor. The powers of sanction available to the High Court range up to the striking off of a solicitor. If either party is unhappy with a decision of the Tribunal this may be appealed to the High Court. The Law Society's disciplinary regime, the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal and the High Court have dealt with several high-profile cases in recent years some of which, as Deputy Daly will be aware, have resulted in the striking off of the solicitor concerned.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill represents both an enhancement and a broadening of the existing disciplinary regime by providing for an independent body, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, to consider complaints against solicitors and barristers with the support of a designated Complaints Committee. The Regulatory Authority will be independently appointed and have a lay majority and a lay chair. It will provide a first point-of-call for complaints that is fully independent of the professional bodies. Under the Bill, therefore, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or the Bar Council, or to their respective disciplinary tribunals, to deal with complaints as generally happens at present. Instead, they will do so through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. The new Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal will replace the two separate conduct tribunals operating at present with one entity dealing with allegations of misconduct relating both to solicitors and to barristers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[54005\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRT03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce minimum sentencing for sex offenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1054,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing generally, and this review is underway.

Under Article 35.5 of the Constitution, a judge&rsquo;s salary may not be reduced except in the specific circumstances approved in last year&rsquo;s Referendum on Judges&rsquo; Pay.  There is, therefore, no legal provision to withhold a judge&rsquo;s pay while on sick leave.  Following the Referendum, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 which reduced the salary payable to a serving District Court Judge to &euro;136,124 (&euro;123,881 net of the pension related deduction), with effect from 1 January 2012.

Under the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) a person who has served a minimum of two years is entitled to apply for a preserved pension on reaching 65 years or if retiring on established medical grounds, a pro rata pension may be paid after five years.  Alternatively, a judge over the age of 60 who has served a minimum of two years may apply for Cost Neutral Early Retirement (provided for in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012).

There are no plans at present to change this arrangement.<\/p><p>  The majority of members receive this payment on the third Thursday after the end of a particular roster period. In the case of the period which ends on December 9th, this would be due to be paid on 27th December. However, the year-end payrolls are brought forward due to such matters as extra bank holidays which occur during the Christmas and New Year periods, the testing of new computer software to cater for any budgetary changes, inputting of payroll reference data changes for 2013 and the high volume of payroll administration required at the Financial Year End. This in turn means that the payroll date of 27 December has to be brought forward to 20 December. The payroll data for that pay date must be submitted by 7 December 2012.<\/p><p>  This practice outlined above has always been the case and is not a new development.  Garda members always have and continue to receive 13 payments each year for 13 four week periods. It must be remembered that with regard to normal salary payments, Garda&iacute; are paid on a weekly basis and will receive their pay up to and including the pay day of 27 December before the end of the year. In fact, they will receive their salary payment for paydays 20 and 27    December in advance of Christmas on 18 and 20 December respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1108,"content":"<p>Question No. 473 answered with Question No. 451.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Detention Centres","counter":1109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1110,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[46760\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is pressing for action, including prosecution if appropriate, against those officers responsible for the ill-treatment of young offenders detained in St. Patrick's Institution, as recently exposed by the Inspector of Prisons report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1111,"content":"<p>As I have previously informed the House, the type of abuse outlined by the Inspector of Prisons in his report on St. Patrick's Institution is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

As you will be aware the Government committed, in the Programme for Government to remove 16 and 17 year old offenders completely from the adult prison system.  In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's ceased on 1st May, 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. The Government also sanctioned the provision of the necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown. This is due for completion in mid-2014.  These matters were all dealt with by me in cooperation with my colleague Frances Fitzgerald TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible.

However, a specific implementation plan for the strategy had not previously been developed. This Government is now addressing this.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government states that &#8220;<i>the Government will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources and ensure whole of government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector&#8221;.  <\/i>I have established and am personally chairing a new group to develop a realistic implementation plan for progressing the Strategy, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. The new Group has replaced the previous National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group while maintaining the cross-departmental focus and the collaboration with stakeholders. The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group comprises representatives from across Government, a representative from the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of the Implementation Plan is, through engaging with the disability sector and building on the traditional problem-solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector, to make progress to achieve our common interests.  More targeted, innovative and flexible services, designed and delivered on the basis of the evidence drawn from systematic evaluation will help ensure that available resources, which are of course diminished across Government due to the current economic climate, are used to deliver services that meet the needs of the community as efficiently and effectively as possible.  This Implementation Plan will seek to ensure these resources are used as effectively as possible in ensuring that the living standards and access to essential services for people with disabilities are maintained.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Plan is developing well with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and Key Performance Indicators. Discussions are ongoing between the Disability Stakeholders Group and Government Departments in an effort to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. At the most recent meeting of the Implementation Group on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> of November it was agreed that every effort will be made to finalise the Plan at the next meeting of the Group which will be held in Quarter 1 of 2013. Once agreed, the Plan will be published as soon as possible thereafter.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Disability Authority is helping Departments in setting performance indicators and outcomes for the Plan&#8217;s targets and have held one-on-one meetings with Departments to assist them in identifying actions to be included in the Implementation Plan. Work by the Authority in relation to Disability Indicators is also at an advanced stage and will be signed off by the Senior Official&#8217;s Group and the Disability Stakeholder Group shortly. These indicators will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the plan translate into improved quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the process of developing the Implementation Plan, the identification and recording of actions which will be required in order to ensure that Ireland will be in compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when ratification takes place is also being undertaken. Each action in the Plan will be linked to the Article of the Convention and obligations therein which will be met through implementation of that action.<\/p><p><br \/>  Outside of the Implementation Group, I also convened a Disability Forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to ensure the voices of people with disabilities, their needs and concerns are being heard. The first meeting of the Disability Forum, which was attended by over 300 people with disabilities, their carers, and family members was held on the 19<sup>th<\/sup> of June this year and a report of the views expressed will be published shortly. This report will form part of the considerations of the Implementation Group in relation to actions in the Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Support Services","counter":1118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1119,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[46573\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his responsibilities in relation to children residing here in extreme poverty who are asylum seekers or the children of asylum seekers; if his attention has been drawn to the challenges faced by children who are living in direct provision, many of whom lack the most basic of opportunities for education and development; the extent of his Department's function in seeking to alleviate these challenges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1120,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Currently, RIA accommodates 4,822 asylum seekers at 35 accommodation centres throughout the State.  I do not accept the premise of the question that persons residing in the Direct Provision system are in extreme poverty.  The system is essentially cashless but no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; residents receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.<\/p><p>  To elaborate on these services,  it is worth noting the following.  Accommodation in reception and accommodation centres is provided on a full board basis which includes the provision of a room \/ family room (as appropriate) and three meals per day as well as school lunches.  All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State.  Residents are paid a weekly direct provision allowance.  In addition, asylum seekers can access exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowances. Parents may also apply for payments to allow their children to avail of school activities, sports and other activities. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework.<\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.<\/p><p>  An issue to be acknowledged is the length of time spent in the direct provision system. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reorganisation","counter":1121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1122,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[53919\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if the changes to the Reserve Defence Forces is causing major hardship particularly now with having to travel to Athlone from Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1123,"content":"<p>The Report of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was recently published, concluded that the current Reserve organisation required radical reform.  The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.  The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the current numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.<\/p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  You will appreciate that this smaller number of full sized Units, outside of PDF installations, must cover the entire country.  Amongst other considerations, the selection of locations for these Units sought to ensure continued opportunities for people throughout the country to serve in the Reserve.<\/p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  All Reserve Combat Support and Combat Service Support components will be co-located with their PDF &lsquo;Parent Unit&rsquo;.  Reserve personnel will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions in the new organisational structure that best suits their individual circumstances.  Every effort will be made to accommodate personnel within their geographic location and retraining will be available if required.  Whilst there will inevitably be disruption for certain individual members of the Reserve, this re-organisation is necessary in order to ensure the future viability of the Reserve.  The contribution of all members of the Reserve is valued by Government and I sincerely hope that all current members will continue to serve in the new organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[53828\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRU04100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"in respect of the October Exchequer returns, the reason the capital spending for his Department was &euro;2m below profile for this period; his plans to ensure that the full capital spending is implemented before the end of the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1126,"content":"<p> The variance between profiled and actual expenditure to the end of October 2012 is largely due to some of the more significant projects in the capital building programme for this year not progressing as originally scheduled.

The EU Regulation permits Member States to enact national measures supplementing or going beyond the minimum requirements specified in the EU Regulation, provided they are restricted to the Member State&rsquo;s own fishing vessels or to persons established in that Member State.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 232 of 2006) prohibit the landing, transhipment, retention on board, or sale of crawfish below the national minimum landing size of 110mm.  Ireland enacted this higher national MLS in 2001 as it was considered that the lower EU MLS introduced in 2001 offered no conservation protection for the species which was suffering from severe over-fishing.  In addition to the national MLS, the Crawfish (Fisheries Management and Conservation) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 233 of 2006) prohibit the fishing for, retention on board or landing of crawfish caught by nets in two specified areas off the coasts of Kerry and Galway.<\/p><p>  My Department was notified in December 2010 of a complaint received through the EU PILOT system alleging that Ireland&rsquo;s national regulations for the management of the crawfish stock were in breach of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850\/98, were discriminatory and were anti-competitive.  My Department responded in detail to the Commission refuting the allegations made and the Commission closed the PILOT case in December 2011, subject to receipt of a copy of the report of a review I had initiated of the management arrangements for Crawfish and submission to the Commission of any amending national regulations arising.<\/p><p>  On 24 May 2011, I announced that I had asked BIM and the Marine Institute to conduct a review of Ireland&rsquo;s technical conservation measures for crawfish, having regard to the negative and declining state of the crawfish stock, the undesirable by-catch of non-target and possibly protected species from the use of nets by some fishermen in fishing for crawfish, the apparent market preference for smaller crawfish, and the range of technical conservation measures for crawfish used internationally.  The Review was conducted in consultation with crawfish fishermen, shellfish buyers and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  On 14 February 2012, I received the report of the Review, together with a more detailed scientific examination of the crawfish stock from the Marine Institute.  The Review Report is available on BIM&rsquo;s website.  I will arrange for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.  The Review Report made 7 recommendations for the future management of the stock.  It concluded that a reduction in the MLS to the EU minimum level of 95mm would lead to a circa 42% reduction in the reproductive potential of the stock and therefore could not be recommended unless this loss of reproductive potential was compensated by the introduction of a maximum landing size of 120mm.  This alternative measure would prohibit the landing of crawfish in excess of 120mm to create a reservoir of reproducing adult crawfish.  However, the Review identified significant risks in this alternative approach and said it could be recommended only in combination with the introduction of a mechanism to monitor and effectively control and, if necessary, reduce fishing effort on crawfish and then only in areas where it has been demonstrated that there is no discard mortality of crawfish in excess of the maximum landing size.  Having considered these recommendations I consider retention of the present MLS of 110mm to be appropriate at this time.  In this context, it is worth noting that the Review found that 110mm is in fact the most commonly adopted MLS in Northern Europe.<\/p><p>  The Review also emphasised the importance of retaining the crawfish netting prohibitions off Kerry and Galway and recommended that their coverage and the introduction of new closed areas be considered in 2012 in light of new or changed designations for cetaceans under the Habitats Directive.  It recommended that regulations governing the closed areas (S.I. 233 of 2006) be updated to enhance enforcement and my Department is presently working on this task.  Finally, it recommended the enhancement of monitoring of by-catch of cetaceans and seals in tangle nets in Natura 2000 sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":1287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[54489\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the proposals, if any, he has put forward in relation to the need to put in place effective market support measures to deal with price volatility in the context of common agricultural policy reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>Effective market support measures begin with an adequate budget.  If we are to ensure that farmers can be supported through periods of extreme price volatility, we have to first of all ensure that the CAP is properly funded.  Accordingly, I have been supporting the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in their ongoing efforts to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible in the negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).  We have said that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to freeze the CAP budget at 2013 levels in nominal terms is a reasonable starting point, and at the recent European Council the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible CAP deal in the MFF.<\/p><p>  As regards the market support measures themselves, the broad thrust of the Commission&rsquo;s CAP reform proposals is, in my view, generally acceptable, in that the proposals strike a good overall balance in providing an effective safety net.  The main support measures, including those of most relevance to Ireland, are retained, and the inclusion of exceptional measures, with flexible triggers, to overcome emergency circumstances is welcome, as are the transitional provisions which provide for the abolition of sugar quotas.  However, I have stated my preference for mandatory rather than the proposed discretionary intervention for beef and veal if the trigger price is reached, and for the continuation of mandatory APS for butter rather than the discretionary mechanism proposed by the Commission, given the role of APS as an important mechanism for easing seasonal supply pressures.  I have also supported colleagues who have indicated that a review of reference prices is warranted in order to bring them up to date with current market realities.<\/p><p>  On sugar quotas, I have been very clear in my support for the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to abolish quotas from 30 September 2015, but I have also made it clear that, in the event that the quota regime is extended, there should be no market control barriers to the re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry, catering for our national requirements.  Another key issue on which I have expressed concern relates to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to strengthen the role of producer organisations, associations of producer organisations and interbranch organisations.  While I agree that measures to strengthen the position of primary producers in the food chain are warranted, I believe we must be careful to ensure that such measures do not in any way prejudice the effective operation of the single market, which is an absolutely fundamental element both of the Treaties and of the CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1291,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[54491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disadvantaged area aid payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1292,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[54492\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRX02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1293,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 537 together.<\/p><p>  The person named is an applicant under both the 2012 Single Payment Scheme and the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that hold funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC), has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.<\/p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding.  From January 2013 it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding involving six national organisations to CDYSB.  These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department.  The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC.  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.  Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.<\/p><p>  It  is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves.

Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened.  The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.

A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013. In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. <\/p><p>  There is no intention to impose financial penalties on hospitals in relation to achieving waiting time targets. The SDU will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF in order to ensure that waiting time targets are met. The HSE is also continuing to work closely with the hospitals that are operating budget deficits to ensure that the service impact of cost containment is kept to a minimum and to ensure that patient safety remains at the core of all decision making. The focus at all times is to achieve savings by obtaining better value for money and by continuing to introduce efficiencies in how hospitals do their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRY03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sick Pay Scheme","counter":1366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRY03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1367,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[53719\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRY03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rate of absenteeism for year to date by region; the cost of absenteeism by region broken down by staffing categories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1368,"content":"<p>As a result of Labour Court recommendations, reformed sick leave rules across the public service are being introduced over the next 15 months:<\/p><p>-   A halving of self-certified sick leave to a maximum of seven days in a rolling two-year period.

In this context, the NSP 2012 provides for the replication nationally of the model operational in the HSE's North East Area, managed by the National Counselling Service (NCS), as a way of meeting the requirement to improve access to psychological therapies in Primary Care.  The cost of this extended service has been estimated at &#8364;5 million annually.<\/p><p><br \/>  To implement the model nationally, an additional Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) counsellor will be allocated to each of the 10 National Counselling Services.  These counsellors will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals.  The  10 posts were advertised recently for a national panel.  Interviews have now been completed and the results will be issued shortly.  The start dates for these posts are expected to be in early 2013 to allow for the process of checking references etc.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The actual counselling services required will be procured through the two employment agencies that hold the existing national contracts with the HSE and counsellors will be recruited through a two stage process.  The employment agencies will select counsellors using their own selection process with reference to qualifications and identify them as suitable for the service.  The HSE will then quality assure the proposed counsellors in terms of professional skills and knowledge prior to entering into the service.  Discussions with the contracted agencies have already begun on these points.  It is expected that this new service will begin to be rolled out early next year when the 10 coordinator counsellors are in place.

Notwithstanding this, it is expected that there will be some savings on capital expenditure at year end which will be used to mitigate excess current expenditure, on a once off basis, in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1419,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[53842\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the commitment he gave to the members of Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder that a paper would be put to Government urgently which would propose a package of supports to be put in place for those affected by the increased incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents here from 2009, connected to vaccination with Pandemrix; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1420,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[53854\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding narcolepsy.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1421,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[53893\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which he plans to present the paper outlining the package of supports being put in place for those affected by Narcolepsy associated with the vaccine Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in the presentation of the paper prior to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann summer recess, again in September 2012 and once again this October; when will he re-establish communication with SOUND; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1422,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[53897\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when will a proposal be put to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann setting out a package of supports for those who developed narcolepsy as a result of vaccination with Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in bringing the proposal to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and when will he re-establish meaningful contact with SOUND","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1423,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[54119\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the paper outlining details of a proposed package of supports for sufferers of narcolepsy will be published","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1424,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[54449\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he hopes to announce the support the State will be providing to those children who have been identified by the final report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee as being adversely affected by the incidence of narcolepsy as a result of a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine administered for the H1N1 flu virus, otherwise known as Swine 'Flu, particularly as the announcement of supports has been delayed on account of a number of factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1425,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581, 583, 588, 590, 628 and 667 together.<\/p><p>  I am committed to bringing a Memorandum to Government setting out the full response to the issue.

The Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, consequently the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has, at present, no remit in relation to inspecting these services.  The Government is however, committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspection of services by HIQA.<\/p><p>  HIQA have developed and published draft National Standards for Residential Centres for People with Disabilities which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  <\/p><p>  My Department has been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed. The 10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved. My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1431,"content":"<p>Question No. 583 answered with Question No. 581.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":1432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1433,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[53863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide the number of tenders to date, for home care projects; the estimated numbers for next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1434,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive earlier this year concluded a Procurement Framework for<b><\/b>the provision of certain services in connection with Home Care Package provision.

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &#8364;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting.

Work on the latter regime is being progressed in conjunction with Northern Ireland; preparations are well underway to tender jointly for a health impact assessment to be carried out - a measure that would be key to underpinning any regime of minimum unit pricing given the prospects for such a policy to be challenged.  As minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption.  Moreover, and arising from the Armagh conference, a North South Alcohol Forum has been initiated and has already met for the purposes of developing areas of work to be elaborated.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question relating to the inclusion of alcohol on the agenda of Ireland's Presidency is indeed pertinent given that the prospect for a new European Union Strategy on Alcohol is being discussed at European Union level.

While this work is continuing, the prospects for encompassing work on alcohol during the tenure of Ireland's Presidency are against the backdrop of many competing priorities on the health agenda.While, I am conscious of the need to  develop proposals on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland, there are no plans at this stage to organise an event on alcohol during Ireland's Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Advertising","counter":1480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1481,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[53952\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the sixith Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Body; his plan to publish same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1482,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[53953\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of meetings held by the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1483,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[53954\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide detail of the payments made to the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland to oversee and monitor the Alcohol Marketing, Communications and Sponsorship Codes since the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing, Communications Monitoring Body in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1484,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 to 607, inclusive, together.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have seen the sixth report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB) and have approved it for publication.

Some organisations provide services for a specific group of children who have a particular kind of disability, or they only operate in one part of the country.  This means that there is considerable variation in children's access to services within regions and across the country. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Health Service Executive has recognised that the current system lacks equity and acknowledges that there is a need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  To this end it is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This Programme aims to achieve a national unified approach to the delivery of disability services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multi-disciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years.<\/i>  Importantly, while the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises the continuing role of special schools.  It is worth noting that therapy services in the HSE Mid-West region are already delivered through the structure of geographically based multi-disciplinary teams and that this has enabled two Special Schools to access multi-disciplinary supports which had previously not been available.  It is common across Europe and elsewhere to have children seen by their local early intervention and school age services whatever the nature of their disability or developmental delay, for example in Bavaria or in the UK.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is being led by the HSE in partnership with the non-statutory disability organisations, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and associated agencies.  It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, voluntary service providers and parents through their umbrella organisations.  At regional level there are Regional Leads for the Programme in each of the four HSE Regions. Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of Local Implementation Groups.  These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The active engagement of stakeholders is a critical element of any change process and implementation of the Programme will involve broad consultation.  No individual or agency representative will have a veto in this regard.  Information on the Programme has been made available widely through the HSE website, bulletins, workshops, and presentations.  The National Advocacy Unit of the HSE has developed guidelines for the reimbursement of expenses for service users participating in the design, development and delivery of services.  These guidelines apply to the participation of parents in the development of this Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the Local Implementation Groups with the following objectives:<\/p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p> - Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Local Implementation Groups will make informed decisions on the optimum use of existing resources, based on local information about resources and the needs of children in their area.  Children will get access to services within existing resources according to their needs regardless of where they go to school.  It is the Local Implementation Groups that will decide how best to phase in the changes in accordance with local conditions.  Significant progress has been made since the Programme was established in 2010.  The HSE envisages that full implementation of the Programme nationally will take two to three years to complete. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[53990\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the waiting lists for ear nose and throat services at Kerry General Hospital where currently 739 adults and 427 children are on the waiting list; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that following a validation exercise the figures for County Kerry have increased significantly; if he will ensure that the County Kerry public receive the service they deserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1496,"content":"<p>Immediately following his appointment, the Minister for Health established the Special Delivery Unit, as set out in the Programme for Government.

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months.<\/p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.   In relation to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WREE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1656,"content":"<p>Question No. 672 answered with Question No. 597.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WREE03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":1657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WREE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1658,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[53705\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400071#WREE03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide in tabular form all payments made to board members of the National Transport Authority including payments, salaries, expenses, mileage, and other allowances and so on since the 1 of January 2012.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1659,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for\u00a0the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

This adjustment does not envisage any reduction in the overall number of volunteer members, nor enforced retirement of currently serving volunteers.\u00a0Significantly, the review\u00a0recommends retention of the existing geographical base of volunteer membership of the Coast Guard.   My Department is currently developing an Action Plan in response to this and other issues which were raised in the VFM review on the Coast Guard, and a related VFM on the Marine Survey Office. I\u00a0will be seeking Governmental approval in the coming weeks for this Action Plan. In relation to the amalgmation of\u00a0Coast Guard units, while there may be merit on the basis outlined within the VFM review, I will not be proposing to Government to force Volunteer Coast Guard Units to amalgmate against the wishes of the volunteers themselves. Any such amalgmation would only be on the basis that it was supported by the membership of both units.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Volunteer Units in Ballycotton and Guileen, they\u00a0are very close to each other, approximately\u00a0ten miles apart, and the Coast Guard managment is considering how the local Coast Guard serives might be developed through\u00a0bringing the two Units\u00a0together. All Coast Guard teams are shoreline search units and are also equipped with modern blue light emergency response vehicles.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Ballycotton is also a highly specialised Cliff Rescue Unit. The Coast Guard recognises the importance of retaining a vibrant Cliff Rescue facility for east Cork coupled with a Shoreline Search unit in the coastline area between the east side of Cork Harbour\u00a0and Knockadoon Head. <\/p><p>  Coast Guard management are consulting with the two units with a view to developing an amalgamation plan\u00a0supported by members of both Units that retains the existing geographical membership base. Should this result in the successful amalgamation of the two units it would afford existing and new members from the Guileen area an opportunity to develop additional skills in Cliff rescue and facilitate the development of a fit for purpose building serving the combined needs of the area. A single Cliff Rescue and Search Unit would provide for an enhanced capacity to provide a more effective life-saving response in the area coupled with an increased capacity to support\u00a0 the other statutory land based emergency services.<\/p><p>  However, as outlined above and as I have discussed with the Deputy previously, Volunteer Units will not be amalgmated against the will of the membership of those units.

Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance. Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage. <\/p><p>  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration. The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.<\/p><p>  The outcomes delivered by the Employment Services from the Intreo Centre Tallaght are as follows:<\/p><p> - 3,500 customers assisted into various training opportunities<\/p><p> - Engagement with 117 companies through the Jobsbridge initiative<\/p><p> - 893 persons assisted with Technical Employment Supports Grants<\/p><p> - 350 persons assisted with payments from the Technical Assistance Training Fund<\/p><p> - 27 persons assisted through the Work Subsidy &amp; the Employment Subsidy Schemes. <\/p><p> - 182 persons assisted through the Work Placement Programme<\/p><p> - Approximately 200 persons will receive assistance through the Activation Family Support Programme by the end of 2012<\/p><p> - 489 persons on the Back to Education Allowance; 160 Back to Work participants and 128 Systematic Short Term Workers.<\/p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region. Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places. The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas. The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  Some 420 persons have been assisted towards participation on the Tus programme in the greater Tallaght area.<\/p><p>  Specifically to the greater Tallaght area, Community Services provide funding to:<\/p><p> - 25 CE schemes serving the greater Tallaght area, with a total of 578 places contained within these schemes.<\/p><p> - There are 5 Jobs Initiative programmes which provide 94 permanent jobs.<\/p><p> - There are 3 Jobs Clubs presently operating in the Tallaght area (which assist persons with interviewing skills, CV preparation, contacts with employers)<\/p><p> - Jobs Clubs operate for a set period of weeks for each group of persons, and have a capacity to engage with circa 400 persons per annum in the Tallaght area.<\/p><p> - The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p> - Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.<\/p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.

As the Deputies will be aware, there are two North South Implementation Bodies under my Department's remit: Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga (comprising two agencies - Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency\/Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch). The Implementation Bodies carry out a range of activities in line with their statutory remits and supported by funding from their two sponsor Departments - my own Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Waterways Ireland, the largest of the North South Implementation bodies, is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.  It has responsibility for approximately 1,000km of navigable waterway and, in 2007, Waterways Ireland&#8217;s remit was extended by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) to include responsibility for the restoration of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Foras na Gaeilge has a range of responsibilities regarding the Irish language, including facilitating and promoting the development of the language on an all-island basis, while the Ulster-Scots Agency has responsibility for the development of the Ulster-Scots language, including the promotion of greater awareness and use of the language and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Bodies operate under the policy direction of the NSMC and the two Governments, and are accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the Ministers of the sponsoring Departments. Further information on these North South Implementation Bodies can be accessed on the following websites: ; ; .   <\/p><p><br \/>  I should say that I and officials of my Department are in regular engagement, both formally and informally, in exploring ways to enhance cooperation across various areas of our remit. In this regard, I - along with the Minister of State at my Department, Mr Dinny McGinley, TD - meet with Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, on a regular basis. Our next formal engagement will be at the NSMC meetings in Inland Waterways and Language sectoral formats on 12 December next in Armagh.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the language and inland waterways sectors, there are a number of other areas of my Department's operations which also come within the remit of DCAL.  These include arts, culture, museums, galleries and commemorations, as well as cooperation in relation to the built and natural heritage, and environmental matters.  I am engaged directly with Minister Ni Chuil&iacute;n on programme development and planning for commemorations, especially those relating to the 1912-1922 period.  The larger commemorative events in Northern Ireland this year have been arranged at community level.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is represented on the East Border Regional Biodiversity Forum which is a cross-border initiative launched in June 2011(part-financed by the EU European Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG IVA Cross-border Programme managed by the Special EU Programmes Body). Action for Biodiversity is a 3 year project which aims to deliver a regional and cross border Biodiversity Framework for the East Border Region.  <b><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  My Department provides funding for collaborations between museums on either side of the border, as well as projects which seek to enhance, celebrate or commemorate the artistic, cultural, musical, film or heritage of the island of Ireland.  Projects funded include:<\/p><p> - The Cinemagic Young Peoples Television and Film Festival, that has run successfully for many years in Belfast and since 2008 has also been held annually in Dublin;<\/p><p> - The Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland, established in 1995 as a means of bringing young people from different cultural backgrounds and communities together using music as a form of dialogue.  The orchestra is made up of young people aged 12 &#8211; 24 years from counties North and South, from as far apart as Cork to North Antrim.  The orchestra undertakes cross border and cross community collaborations and provides music education and performance programmes for up to 7,000 children annually.<\/p><p> - The Cinemobile cross-border project, a mobile cinema lorry that tours Ireland showing movies in areas that do not have a cinema.  Cinemobile carries out a project that involves the twinning of a number of schools, North and South.<\/p><p> - My Department has also provided funding for the provision of a Cross-Border Cultural Broker to assist in the success of Derry UK City of Culture 2013.  The Cultural Broker has responsibility for Arts and Regeneration.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is ongoing cooperation between the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council\/An Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on for a number of years and a joint annual plenary is held where they discuss and manage common strategic commitments.  The Irish Film Board also has ongoing co-operation with Northern Ireland Screen in respect of film funding. In that regard, two new films &#8220;Jump&#8221; and &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; that are jointly funded by both bodies will be released next year.  The Culture Night initiative, which launched in Dublin in 2006, has been extended to many towns, cities and counties across the island of Ireland and the 2012 Culture Night, which took place on 21 September 2012, included participation by 6 regions in Northern Ireland.  If the Deputies are interested in receiving more specific information on any particular project or area of co-operation, I would be happy to provide it on request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400072#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il","counter":1784,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400073#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1785,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[54423\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400073#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n taighde at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag a Roinn faoi na deacrachta&iacute; oideachas&uacute;la a chruth&oacute;dh athbhreithni&uacute; ar an gCaighde&aacute;n gach seacht mbliana.","asker":"1028","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1786,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[54424\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400073#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"maidir lena mholadh i mBille Choimisi&uacute;in Thithe an Oireachtais, an eol d&oacute; t&iacute;ortha eile ar domhan a bhfuil r&eacute;imis seacht mbliana acu idir athbhreithni&uacute; ar chaighde&aacute;n oifigi&uacute;il a dTeanga N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, n&oacute; c&eacute;n taighde teangeola&iacute;ochta a bhfuil s&eacute; ag brath air a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn gur mar sin at&aacute;.","asker":"1028","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1787,"content":"<p>Freagr&oacute;idh m&eacute; Ceisteanna Uimh. 350 agus 351 le ch&eacute;ile.<\/p><p>  Mar is eol don Teachta, foils&iacute;odh an Caighde&aacute;n Oifigi&uacute;il den ch&eacute;ad uair i 1958.

I expect that local authorities will use the available avenues to the fullest to help fund the services which are important for the wellbeing of every household and community.  The legislation empowers local authorities to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and local authorities will pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings where it is considered appropriate.

The company is wholly owned by Dublin City Council; the shareholders of the company consist of seven senior officials of Dublin City Council.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears. Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<\/p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Shared Ownership Scheme specifically, the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway. I will shortly publish material on my Department&rsquo;s website, in furtherance of the review, and this will facilitate stakeholder consultation which is likely to take place early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400075#WRRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1937,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400075#WRRR02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1938,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[54304\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400075#WRRR02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason local authorities do not have to make the details of their own planning applications available online as it the case with other planning applications; if he will agree that they should be available for viewing on line and that quite often such applications are of great public interest as they often relate to public works, road realignments and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1939,"content":"<p>Section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and the associated Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, set out the legal requirements in relation to local authority own development which does not require environmental impact assessment.

The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. One case has been finalised with several more due to close by year end; however, lenders have put forward in excess of 500 cases and currently are actively engaged with over 100 customers on Mortgage to Rent with a further 100 cases at an early stage in the process.<\/p><p>  The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made.

It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme.

The Directive sets legally binding limit values, and target values for a range of pollutants and requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring is conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of permanent and fixed-term air quality monitoring stations located around the country, reporting the results on its website at: <font color=\"#0000FF\">. <\/font> Monitoring includes the following pollutants: nitrogen oxides; sulphur dioxide; carbon monoxide; ozone; particulate matter (PM<sub>10<\/sub> and PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>), ozone, benzene and volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  The EPA publishes also an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2011 &#8211; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality<\/i>  , was published in September 2012 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2011, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. <\/p><p><br \/>  No exceedances of EU limit values were recorded for 2011 and downward trends have been identified for many pollutants. However, levels of particulate matter (PMs) are a concern, especially where there is widespread reliance on solid fuel for residential heating, particularly in towns where the ban on bituminous coal does not apply. To maintain good standards of air quality and ensure that, in the future, air across all Ireland will be healthy and clean, local authorities must continue to enforce the ban on bituminous coal with improved effectiveness. Air quality could also benefit significantly if households used more efficient methods for space heating by shifting from solid fuel to cleaner, more efficient alternatives; this would also have additional climate benefits by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Following public, industry and local authority consultations, I introduced revised and updated solid fuel regulations to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential solid fuels. Under the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 which were given effect in August 2012,<\/p><p> - most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p> - seven new towns are being added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p> - a prohibition on the burning of bituminous or smoky coal was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution. <\/p><p><br \/>  The new regulations will ensure that the ban continues to be effective in maintaining good air quality standards in our cities and towns, protecting human health and the environment.  Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2<\/sub>) levels in larger urban areas, derived mainly from road traffic, have remained relatively static since 2002, with signs of a slight increasing trend in the years 2008-2010. Further reductions of NO<sub>2<\/sub> levels will require improved emission standards from new vehicles, reduced demand for private road transport, increased use of alternatives to the private car such as cycling, walking and public transport.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":1973,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1974,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[54557\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he hopes to be in a position to provide adequate funding for local authorities in the coming year notwithstanding the economic difficulties he inherited from his predecessor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1975,"content":"<p><i>The Action Programme for Effective Local Government - <\/i><i><i>Putting People First<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>  reinforces local government as the primary means of public service delivery at local level.

This guidance goes on to state that the allocation of SPC chairs should also reflect equitably the spread of   elected representation on the Council.

The shared objective of the project was to provide an established co-operative process for sharing information and addressing any technical issues arising. This represented a significant advance in addressing Ireland&#8217;s long-standing concerns about Sellafield. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government engaged a team of independent technical experts that included nuclear physicists, chemists and engineers. The expert team brought specialist knowledge and expertise which is not readily available within the Irish Government system due to the absence of a nuclear power generation or reprocessing industry here. The function of the team was to conduct a comprehensive, objective and scientific assessment of the technical information on Sellafield and its associated facilities made available from the intergovernmental exchange project. The key output is a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) report of the risks to Ireland and Irish interests from incidents at the Sellafield nuclear site.<\/p><p><br \/>  The team paid a number of site visits to Sellafield, examined various facilities, accessed extensive documentation, and conducted a number of technical exchanges with operators at the site and with UK regulators which enabled the team to develop reliable, accurate, risk models and calculations. The expert team used additional sources of information such as their own knowledge of operating history and data from similar nuclear facilities around the world to make expert judgments.   <\/p><p><br \/>  On completion of the project, the team produced a 1,000 page main report. A public summary document was released as the team recommended that the full report should not be published because to have such a substantial volume of security-sensitive information in the public domain would serve to increase the risks posed by Sellafield to both the UK and to Ireland. This 4 year project cost &#8364;4.8m gross, or &#8364;4.0m net of VAT. As the team&#8217;s brief was explicitly to assess the risks posed to <i>Ireland<\/i> from Sellafield, the UK did not meet any of these costs, though the UK would have incurred its own costs through, for example, facilitating the information exchange and hosting site visits.   <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department and others will now study the information in the report in detail and use it in the context of Government policies relating to Sellafield and the nuclear sector more broadly. Ireland must continue to be vigilant in relation to Sellafield as work to decommission the site over the lifetime of the &#8220;Sellafield Plan&#8221; continues. It is critical from an Irish perspective that the UK decommissioning of the site is undertaken safely and in accordance with best international practice.  The finalisation of this report marks the improved information sharing process that has developed between the Irish and UK Governments since 2008. Particularly given our status as a non-nuclear country, Ireland looks forward to continued timely sharing of key information with the UK authorities in the future on nuclear matters, including Sellafield and the UK nuclear new-build programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":1997,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1998,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[54581\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in order to facilitate smaller parties, if he will consider increasing the number of councillors representing each local authority on regional authorities.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1999,"content":"<p>The Action Programme for Effective Local Government: <i>Putting People First<\/i>, which I published in October 2012 following Government approval, sets out the Government&#8217;s decision regarding new arrangements at regional level.

There are extended opening hours in operation in the office from Monday to Thursday (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM); on Friday the hours are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. As it happens, September and October are the peak months for registrations in the State primarily as a result of students beginning or returning to their studies. In recognition of this, special arrangements are put in place in September and October to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges. Periods of time are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 specifically for registration of students.<\/p><p><br \/>  This year these arrangements were extended into November. Naturally, at particularly busy periods and not withstanding the special arrangements put in place, there may be occasions when, based on the numbers seeking to register and estimated processing times, processing capacity is reached for that day and persons attending beyond that point are asked to return at another time. This is simply a matter of managing demand on the day in a  sensible, proactive and safe manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The increase in the fee in respect of the issue of a registration certificate under the Immigration Act, 2004 came into effect on 19 November, 2012. Any person issued with a registration certificate from that date will be required to pay the new fee of &#8364;300 unless they come within those categories exempted from the charge. In respect of persons who may have been seeking to obtain a re-entry visa, I should point out that the fees for same have not changed.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: <\/p><p><br \/>  - UN Convention Refugees;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04;<\/p><p><br \/>  - Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996; and<\/p><p><br \/>  - Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.<\/p><p><br \/>  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &#8364;3.2 million in fees waived.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is an unavoidable consequence that people seeking to register will fall on the either side of the fee increase introduction. It is understandable too that many people would have sought to avail of the lower rate in advance of the fee increase resulting in numbers at the public office Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) rising to exceptional levels at certain times. <\/p><p><br \/>  For the sake of completeness, I should also add that the cost of various services to immigrants here compares favourably with other jurisdictions and that, in particular in respect of student immigrants, the fee charged for immigration services is, in the great majority of cases, a small proportion of the overall fees they are required to pay the supplier of educational services. I would point out that this is the first increase since 2008 and that the fee increase itself will be used to defray some of the costs of providing and developing enhanced services to migrants.<\/p><p><i>The following information was provided under Standing Order 40A.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>The main issue that gave rise to the difficulty on the day in question was physical capacity in the office which deals with immigration registration which is performed by civilian employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p><br \/>  At an early stage of the day in question, it became clear that physical capacity to the office to deal with applications had been reached and indeed exceeded.  Because of this a number of applicants were turned away and advised to return on the following week - at which time of course the fee increase had come into effect.  It is not possible to say with complete accuracy how many people were in this category but the Garda&iacute; estimate that it may have been in the region of 60 people.  I am also advised that this number is likely to include people who had other immigration related business on that day which was unrelated to registration.<\/p><p><br \/>  Having reflected on the matter, in addition to turning these applicants away and requesting them to return on another occasion, it would also have been appropriate to take their details so that upon their return a lower fee could have been charged to them.  In saying this, I think it is important to acknowledge that everyone acted in good faith and made their best endeavours to deal with a huge increase in the volume of callers to the office where this business is conducted.<\/p><p><br \/>  While clearly there will always be difficulties in circumstances where fees are being increased where some will inevitably fall outside the cut off point, nevertheless it should be possible to put in place some arrangement to deal with the type of situation which occurred in this instance. <\/p><p><br \/>  Accordingly, I have requested my officials in conjunctions with the Garda National Immigration Bureau to devise a system which would to the greatest extent possible avoid a recurrence of such a problem.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the meantime, I would like to apologise to the individuals in question for any inconvenience caused to them.  It is not possible to independently identify such persons so therefore they cannot be refunded the additional fee charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coroners Service","counter":2015,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2016,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[53728\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is enough in the Coroner&rsquo;s Act to deal with the death of a person (details supplied) and if this legislation needs updating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2017,"content":"<p>Under the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation of the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.

The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400076#WRS05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service","counter":2019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2020,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[53744\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of money spent on free legal aid in 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 on a national and regional or county basis.","asker":"968","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2021,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[53936\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of legal aid paid to solicitors in each court area for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2022,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 and 444 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, legal aid services within this State are divided into two separate categories, namely civil legal aid through the Legal Aid Board under the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid 1995, and criminal legal aid through the courts and the judiciary under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962.<\/p><p>I propose to take each in turn as set out below:<\/p><p><bu>Civil Legal Aid<\/bu><\/p><p>In respect of civil legal aid, the service is provided by the Legal Aid Board and incorporates legal services for asylum seekers.

I propose to take each in turn as set out below:<\/p><p><b>  Civil Legal Aid<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  In the first instance it should be noted that in the vast majority of cases, civil legal aid is not free. Persons who receive civil legal services are generally obliged to pay a financial contribution.<\/p><p><br \/>  The criteria for qualifying for civil legal aid are set out in sections 24 to 29 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 &#8211; 2006. In summary, the financial eligibility threshold at the moment is that a person&#8217;s disposable income must not exceed &#8364;18,000. Disposable income is calculated by taking a person&#8217;s gross income (the Board does not treat certain State payments that are made for the benefit of another person as income) and deducting certain allowances. The main allowances are an allowance for a spouse, each child, child care costs, rent or mortgage, income tax, PRSI and USC payments. There is also a capital threshold for eligibility.   disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, small claims and defamation.  There is a general &#8216;merits&#8217; test for getting legal advice and a more specific test for getting legal aid (representation). Legal aid can only be granted for matters before the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice. In addition the Minister for Justice and Equality may prescribe any other court or a tribunal for the purpose of making legal aid available. The only tribunal that has been prescribed to date is the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  At present, I have no plans to change the qualification criteria for civil legal aid.<\/p><p><b>  Criminal Legal Aid<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  This is purely a discretionary matter for each court and is not governed by any financial eligibility guidelines.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.<\/p><p><br \/>  An applicant for free legal aid may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  Such an offence carries a penalty of a fine or imprisonment or both.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Also, it must be borne in mind that Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  It is with due regard to these clear rights that any criminal legal aid scheme must operate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Officials of my Department are developing a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid, including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  As currently drafted, the Bill will regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse. The transfer of responsibility arrangement to the Legal Aid Board reflects the practice in other jurisdictions where one agency deals with all aspects of legal aid and where it is thereby possible to bring a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of all of the legal aid schemes.  There is still a significant amount of work to be done in developing the Bill but I would hope that it would be possible to publish it during 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will also be interested to know that the fees payable under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme have been subject to three separate reductions over the past few years and some structural changes were also introduced to the fees payable in the course of 2011.  To date in 2012, expenditure is &#8364;46.16 million which represents a welcome decrease of approximately 10% over the same period in 2011.  A number of measures aimed at achieving greater efficiencies in criminal proceedings are being implemented in collaboration with the relevant agencies and with cooperation from legal practitioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":2027,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2028,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[53776\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence Istanbul Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2029,"content":"<p>As I stated in my reply to PQ No. 51818\/12  of 21 November, 2012, Ireland supports, in principle, the aims and terms of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.

The Bill provides for the modernisation and reform of the way legal services are provided in the State along with the more independent regulation of the legal professions and greater transparency and competition in relation to legal costs. The Bill, therefore, gives legislative expression to the commitment given in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.<\/i>It supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery as a specific deliverable under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding while also taking account of recommendations made by the Legal Costs Working Group and by the Competition Authority. The Competition Authority has published reports on several of the professions in addition to solicitors and barristers - for example, on doctors and dentists - and these other professions are outside my remit as Minister for Justice, Equality &amp; Defence.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to Deputy Broughan's question on legal costs, the Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. For the first time, these cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs. Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the accountability of the two legal professions is to be enhanced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill, it is not accurate to contend that there are no &quot;independent procedures and penalties operated by the Law Society of Ireland&quot;. Under current law the Law Society is, in fact, bound by the conduct regime of the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2011. In particular, Part 3 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act of 1994 makes detailed provision for the investigation of complaints against solicitors. The Society&#8217;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints lodged directly to the Law Society by members of the public. A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles such a complaint may, under the current legislation, then refer the matter to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (also appointed under the Solicitors Acts)   at any time within the three year period immediately following the Society&#8217;s decision.<\/p><p><br \/>  Complaints about professional misconduct may also be made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  Even where a complaint of misconduct has been made to the Law Society in the first instance, it may also be referred by the Society to the Tribunal.  The members of the Tribunal, which includes lay persons, are appointed by the President of the High Court. Where there is a finding of misconduct, the Tribunal can impose a sanction on the solicitor ranging from admonishment to a direction to pay restitution of a sum not exceeding &#8364;15,000 to any aggrieved party. In more serious cases the Tribunal may refer its finding and recommendation to the President of the High Court who ultimately will decide on the nature of the sanction to be imposed on the solicitor. The powers of sanction available to the High Court range up to the striking off of a solicitor. If either party is unhappy with a decision of the Tribunal this may be appealed to the High Court. The Law Society's disciplinary regime, the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal and the High Court have dealt with several high-profile cases in recent years some of which, as Deputy Daly will be aware, have resulted in the striking off of the solicitor concerned.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill represents both an enhancement and a broadening of the existing disciplinary regime by providing for an independent body, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, to consider complaints against solicitors and barristers with the support of a designated Complaints Committee. The Regulatory Authority will be independently appointed and have a lay majority and a lay chair. It will provide a first point-of-call for complaints that is fully independent of the professional bodies. Under the Bill, therefore, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or the Bar Council, or to their respective disciplinary tribunals, to deal with complaints as generally happens at present. Instead, they will do so through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. The new Legal Practitioners&#8217; Disciplinary Tribunal will replace the two separate conduct tribunals operating at present with one entity dealing with allegations of misconduct relating both to solicitors and to barristers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":2064,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2065,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[54005\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRT03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce minimum sentencing for sex offenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2066,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing generally, and this review is underway.

Under Article 35.5 of the Constitution, a judge&rsquo;s salary may not be reduced except in the specific circumstances approved in last year&rsquo;s Referendum on Judges&rsquo; Pay.  There is, therefore, no legal provision to withhold a judge&rsquo;s pay while on sick leave.  Following the Referendum, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 which reduced the salary payable to a serving District Court Judge to &euro;136,124 (&euro;123,881 net of the pension related deduction), with effect from 1 January 2012.

Pensions in respect of District Judges are based on 1\/40th of salary per year of service up to a maximum period of twenty years.  A lump sum is calculated at 3\/40ths of salary up to a maximum of 1.5 times salary.    Under the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) a person who has served a minimum of two years is entitled to apply for a preserved pension on reaching 65 years or if retiring on established medical grounds, a pro rata pension may be paid after five years.  Alternatively, a judge over the age of 60 who has served a minimum of two years may apply for Cost Neutral Early Retirement (provided for in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012).

This is something she had been seeking for a number of years that previous Governments had refused to authorise. She can be assured of my Department's full support and will be facilitated in every way possible.  As you will be aware the Government committed, in the Programme for Government to remove 16 and 17 year old offenders completely from the adult prison system.  In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's ceased on 1st May, 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. The Government also sanctioned the provision of the necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown. This is due for completion in mid-2014.  These matters were all dealt with by me in cooperation with my colleague Frances Fitzgerald TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible.

However, a specific implementation plan for the strategy had not previously been developed. This Government is now addressing this.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government states that &#8220;<i>the Government will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources and ensure whole of government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector&#8221;.  <\/i>I have established and am personally chairing a new group to develop a realistic implementation plan for progressing the Strategy, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. The new Group has replaced the previous National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group while maintaining the cross-departmental focus and the collaboration with stakeholders. The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group comprises representatives from across Government, a representative from the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of the Implementation Plan is, through engaging with the disability sector and building on the traditional problem-solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector, to make progress to achieve our common interests.  More targeted, innovative and flexible services, designed and delivered on the basis of the evidence drawn from systematic evaluation will help ensure that available resources, which are of course diminished across Government due to the current economic climate, are used to deliver services that meet the needs of the community as efficiently and effectively as possible.  This Implementation Plan will seek to ensure these resources are used as effectively as possible in ensuring that the living standards and access to essential services for people with disabilities are maintained.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Plan is developing well with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and Key Performance Indicators. Discussions are ongoing between the Disability Stakeholders Group and Government Departments in an effort to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. At the most recent meeting of the Implementation Group on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> of November it was agreed that every effort will be made to finalise the Plan at the next meeting of the Group which will be held in Quarter 1 of 2013. Once agreed, the Plan will be published as soon as possible thereafter.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Disability Authority is helping Departments in setting performance indicators and outcomes for the Plan&#8217;s targets and have held one-on-one meetings with Departments to assist them in identifying actions to be included in the Implementation Plan. Work by the Authority in relation to Disability Indicators is also at an advanced stage and will be signed off by the Senior Official&#8217;s Group and the Disability Stakeholder Group shortly. These indicators will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the plan translate into improved quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the process of developing the Implementation Plan, the identification and recording of actions which will be required in order to ensure that Ireland will be in compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when ratification takes place is also being undertaken. Each action in the Plan will be linked to the Article of the Convention and obligations therein which will be met through implementation of that action.<\/p><p><br \/>  Outside of the Implementation Group, I also convened a Disability Forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to ensure the voices of people with disabilities, their needs and concerns are being heard. The first meeting of the Disability Forum, which was attended by over 300 people with disabilities, their carers, and family members was held on the 19<sup>th<\/sup> of June this year and a report of the views expressed will be published shortly. This report will form part of the considerations of the Implementation Group in relation to actions in the Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Support Services","counter":2130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03650"},{"type":"question","counter":2131,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[46573\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his responsibilities in relation to children residing here in extreme poverty who are asylum seekers or the children of asylum seekers; if his attention has been drawn to the challenges faced by children who are living in direct provision, many of whom lack the most basic of opportunities for education and development; the extent of his Department's function in seeking to alleviate these challenges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2132,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Currently, RIA accommodates 4,822 asylum seekers at 35 accommodation centres throughout the State.  I do not accept the premise of the question that persons residing in the Direct Provision system are in extreme poverty.  The system is essentially cashless but no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; residents receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.<\/p><p>  To elaborate on these services,  it is worth noting the following.  Accommodation in reception and accommodation centres is provided on a full board basis which includes the provision of a room \/ family room (as appropriate) and three meals per day as well as school lunches.  All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State.  Residents are paid a weekly direct provision allowance.  In addition, asylum seekers can access exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowances. Parents may also apply for payments to allow their children to avail of school activities, sports and other activities. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework.<\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.<\/p><p>  An issue to be acknowledged is the length of time spent in the direct provision system. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":2134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reorganisation","counter":2133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03850"},{"type":"question","counter":2134,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[53919\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if the changes to the Reserve Defence Forces is causing major hardship particularly now with having to travel to Athlone from Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2135,"content":"<p>The Report of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was recently published, concluded that the current Reserve organisation required radical reform.  The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.  The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the current numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.<\/p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  You will appreciate that this smaller number of full sized Units, outside of PDF installations, must cover the entire country.  Amongst other considerations, the selection of locations for these Units sought to ensure continued opportunities for people throughout the country to serve in the Reserve.<\/p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  All Reserve Combat Support and Combat Service Support components will be co-located with their PDF &lsquo;Parent Unit&rsquo;.  Reserve personnel will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions in the new organisational structure that best suits their individual circumstances.  Every effort will be made to accommodate personnel within their geographic location and retraining will be available if required.  Whilst there will inevitably be disruption for certain individual members of the Reserve, this re-organisation is necessary in order to ensure the future viability of the Reserve.  The contribution of all members of the Reserve is valued by Government and I sincerely hope that all current members will continue to serve in the new organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure","counter":2136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU04050"},{"type":"question","counter":2137,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[53828\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRU04100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"in respect of the October Exchequer returns, the reason the capital spending for his Department was &euro;2m below profile for this period; his plans to ensure that the full capital spending is implemented before the end of the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2138,"content":"<p> The variance between profiled and actual expenditure to the end of October 2012 is largely due to some of the more significant projects in the capital building programme for this year not progressing as originally scheduled.

The EU Regulation permits Member States to enact national measures supplementing or going beyond the minimum requirements specified in the EU Regulation, provided they are restricted to the Member State&rsquo;s own fishing vessels or to persons established in that Member State.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 232 of 2006) prohibit the landing, transhipment, retention on board, or sale of crawfish below the national minimum landing size of 110mm.  Ireland enacted this higher national MLS in 2001 as it was considered that the lower EU MLS introduced in 2001 offered no conservation protection for the species which was suffering from severe over-fishing.  In addition to the national MLS, the Crawfish (Fisheries Management and Conservation) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 233 of 2006) prohibit the fishing for, retention on board or landing of crawfish caught by nets in two specified areas off the coasts of Kerry and Galway.<\/p><p>  My Department was notified in December 2010 of a complaint received through the EU PILOT system alleging that Ireland&rsquo;s national regulations for the management of the crawfish stock were in breach of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850\/98, were discriminatory and were anti-competitive.  My Department responded in detail to the Commission refuting the allegations made and the Commission closed the PILOT case in December 2011, subject to receipt of a copy of the report of a review I had initiated of the management arrangements for Crawfish and submission to the Commission of any amending national regulations arising.<\/p><p>  On 24 May 2011, I announced that I had asked BIM and the Marine Institute to conduct a review of Ireland&rsquo;s technical conservation measures for crawfish, having regard to the negative and declining state of the crawfish stock, the undesirable by-catch of non-target and possibly protected species from the use of nets by some fishermen in fishing for crawfish, the apparent market preference for smaller crawfish, and the range of technical conservation measures for crawfish used internationally.  The Review was conducted in consultation with crawfish fishermen, shellfish buyers and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  On 14 February 2012, I received the report of the Review, together with a more detailed scientific examination of the crawfish stock from the Marine Institute.  The Review Report is available on BIM&rsquo;s website.  I will arrange for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.  The Review Report made 7 recommendations for the future management of the stock.  It concluded that a reduction in the MLS to the EU minimum level of 95mm would lead to a circa 42% reduction in the reproductive potential of the stock and therefore could not be recommended unless this loss of reproductive potential was compensated by the introduction of a maximum landing size of 120mm.  This alternative measure would prohibit the landing of crawfish in excess of 120mm to create a reservoir of reproducing adult crawfish.  However, the Review identified significant risks in this alternative approach and said it could be recommended only in combination with the introduction of a mechanism to monitor and effectively control and, if necessary, reduce fishing effort on crawfish and then only in areas where it has been demonstrated that there is no discard mortality of crawfish in excess of the maximum landing size.  Having considered these recommendations I consider retention of the present MLS of 110mm to be appropriate at this time.  In this context, it is worth noting that the Review found that 110mm is in fact the most commonly adopted MLS in Northern Europe.<\/p><p>  The Review also emphasised the importance of retaining the crawfish netting prohibitions off Kerry and Galway and recommended that their coverage and the introduction of new closed areas be considered in 2012 in light of new or changed designations for cetaceans under the Habitats Directive.  It recommended that regulations governing the closed areas (S.I. 233 of 2006) be updated to enhance enforcement and my Department is presently working on this task.  Finally, it recommended the enhancement of monitoring of by-catch of cetaceans and seals in tangle nets in Natura 2000 sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":2299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2300,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[54489\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the proposals, if any, he has put forward in relation to the need to put in place effective market support measures to deal with price volatility in the context of common agricultural policy reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2301,"content":"<p>Effective market support measures begin with an adequate budget.  If we are to ensure that farmers can be supported through periods of extreme price volatility, we have to first of all ensure that the CAP is properly funded.  Accordingly, I have been supporting the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in their ongoing efforts to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible in the negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).  We have said that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to freeze the CAP budget at 2013 levels in nominal terms is a reasonable starting point, and at the recent European Council the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible CAP deal in the MFF.<\/p><p>  As regards the market support measures themselves, the broad thrust of the Commission&rsquo;s CAP reform proposals is, in my view, generally acceptable, in that the proposals strike a good overall balance in providing an effective safety net.  The main support measures, including those of most relevance to Ireland, are retained, and the inclusion of exceptional measures, with flexible triggers, to overcome emergency circumstances is welcome, as are the transitional provisions which provide for the abolition of sugar quotas.  However, I have stated my preference for mandatory rather than the proposed discretionary intervention for beef and veal if the trigger price is reached, and for the continuation of mandatory APS for butter rather than the discretionary mechanism proposed by the Commission, given the role of APS as an important mechanism for easing seasonal supply pressures.  I have also supported colleagues who have indicated that a review of reference prices is warranted in order to bring them up to date with current market realities.<\/p><p>  On sugar quotas, I have been very clear in my support for the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to abolish quotas from 30 September 2015, but I have also made it clear that, in the event that the quota regime is extended, there should be no market control barriers to the re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry, catering for our national requirements.  Another key issue on which I have expressed concern relates to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to strengthen the role of producer organisations, associations of producer organisations and interbranch organisations.  While I agree that measures to strengthen the position of primary producers in the food chain are warranted, I believe we must be careful to ensure that such measures do not in any way prejudice the effective operation of the single market, which is an absolutely fundamental element both of the Treaties and of the CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2303,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[54491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disadvantaged area aid payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":2304,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[54492\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRX02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2305,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 537 together.<\/p><p>  The person named is an applicant under both the 2012 Single Payment Scheme and the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that hold funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC), has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.<\/p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding.  From January 2013 it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding involving six national organisations to CDYSB.  These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department.  The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC.  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.  Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.<\/p><p>  It  is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves.

Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened.  The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.

It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.

A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013. In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. <\/p><p>  There is no intention to impose financial penalties on hospitals in relation to achieving waiting time targets. The SDU will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF in order to ensure that waiting time targets are met. The HSE is also continuing to work closely with the hospitals that are operating budget deficits to ensure that the service impact of cost containment is kept to a minimum and to ensure that patient safety remains at the core of all decision making. The focus at all times is to achieve savings by obtaining better value for money and by continuing to introduce efficiencies in how hospitals do their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRY03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sick Pay Scheme","counter":2378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRY03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2379,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[53719\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRY03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rate of absenteeism for year to date by region; the cost of absenteeism by region broken down by staffing categories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2380,"content":"<p>As a result of Labour Court recommendations, reformed sick leave rules across the public service are being introduced over the next 15 months:<\/p><p>-   A halving of self-certified sick leave to a maximum of seven days in a rolling two-year period.

In this context, the NSP 2012 provides for the replication nationally of the model operational in the HSE's North East Area, managed by the National Counselling Service (NCS), as a way of meeting the requirement to improve access to psychological therapies in Primary Care.  The cost of this extended service has been estimated at &#8364;5 million annually.<\/p><p><br \/>  To implement the model nationally, an additional Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) counsellor will be allocated to each of the 10 National Counselling Services.  These counsellors will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals.  The  10 posts were advertised recently for a national panel.  Interviews have now been completed and the results will be issued shortly.  The start dates for these posts are expected to be in early 2013 to allow for the process of checking references etc.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The actual counselling services required will be procured through the two employment agencies that hold the existing national contracts with the HSE and counsellors will be recruited through a two stage process.  The employment agencies will select counsellors using their own selection process with reference to qualifications and identify them as suitable for the service.  The HSE will then quality assure the proposed counsellors in terms of professional skills and knowledge prior to entering into the service.  Discussions with the contracted agencies have already begun on these points.  It is expected that this new service will begin to be rolled out early next year when the 10 coordinator counsellors are in place.

Notwithstanding this, it is expected that there will be some savings on capital expenditure at year end which will be used to mitigate excess current expenditure, on a once off basis, in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2431,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[53842\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the commitment he gave to the members of Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder that a paper would be put to Government urgently which would propose a package of supports to be put in place for those affected by the increased incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents here from 2009, connected to vaccination with Pandemrix; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2432,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[53854\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding narcolepsy.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2433,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[53893\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which he plans to present the paper outlining the package of supports being put in place for those affected by Narcolepsy associated with the vaccine Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in the presentation of the paper prior to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann summer recess, again in September 2012 and once again this October; when will he re-establish communication with SOUND; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2434,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[53897\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when will a proposal be put to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann setting out a package of supports for those who developed narcolepsy as a result of vaccination with Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in bringing the proposal to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and when will he re-establish meaningful contact with SOUND","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2435,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[54119\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the paper outlining details of a proposed package of supports for sufferers of narcolepsy will be published","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2436,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[54449\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he hopes to announce the support the State will be providing to those children who have been identified by the final report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee as being adversely affected by the incidence of narcolepsy as a result of a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine administered for the H1N1 flu virus, otherwise known as Swine 'Flu, particularly as the announcement of supports has been delayed on account of a number of factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2437,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581, 583, 588, 590, 628 and 667 together.<\/p><p>  I am committed to bringing a Memorandum to Government setting out the full response to the issue.

The Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, consequently the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has, at present, no remit in relation to inspecting these services.  The Government is however, committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspection of services by HIQA.<\/p><p>  HIQA have developed and published draft National Standards for Residential Centres for People with Disabilities which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  <\/p><p>  My Department has been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed. The 10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved. My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2443,"content":"<p>Question No. 583 answered with Question No. 581.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":2444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":2445,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[53863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide the number of tenders to date, for home care projects; the estimated numbers for next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2446,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive earlier this year concluded a Procurement Framework for<b><\/b>the provision of certain services in connection with Home Care Package provision.

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &#8364;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting.

The hospital has advised that the patients in question have all been admitted. The position with regard to the facilities in St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin for patients with Cystic Fibrosis is being continuously monitored.

Work on the latter regime is being progressed in conjunction with Northern Ireland; preparations are well underway to tender jointly for a health impact assessment to be carried out - a measure that would be key to underpinning any regime of minimum unit pricing given the prospects for such a policy to be challenged.  As minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption.  Moreover, and arising from the Armagh conference, a North South Alcohol Forum has been initiated and has already met for the purposes of developing areas of work to be elaborated.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question relating to the inclusion of alcohol on the agenda of Ireland's Presidency is indeed pertinent given that the prospect for a new European Union Strategy on Alcohol is being discussed at European Union level.

While this work is continuing, the prospects for encompassing work on alcohol during the tenure of Ireland's Presidency are against the backdrop of many competing priorities on the health agenda.While, I am conscious of the need to  develop proposals on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland, there are no plans at this stage to organise an event on alcohol during Ireland's Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Advertising","counter":2492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2493,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[53952\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the sixith Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Body; his plan to publish same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2494,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[53953\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of meetings held by the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2495,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[53954\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide detail of the payments made to the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland to oversee and monitor the Alcohol Marketing, Communications and Sponsorship Codes since the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing, Communications Monitoring Body in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2496,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 to 607, inclusive, together.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have seen the sixth report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB) and have approved it for publication.

Some organisations provide services for a specific group of children who have a particular kind of disability, or they only operate in one part of the country.  This means that there is considerable variation in children's access to services within regions and across the country. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Health Service Executive has recognised that the current system lacks equity and acknowledges that there is a need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  To this end it is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This Programme aims to achieve a national unified approach to the delivery of disability services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multi-disciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years.<\/i>  Importantly, while the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises the continuing role of special schools.  It is worth noting that therapy services in the HSE Mid-West region are already delivered through the structure of geographically based multi-disciplinary teams and that this has enabled two Special Schools to access multi-disciplinary supports which had previously not been available.  It is common across Europe and elsewhere to have children seen by their local early intervention and school age services whatever the nature of their disability or developmental delay, for example in Bavaria or in the UK.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is being led by the HSE in partnership with the non-statutory disability organisations, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and associated agencies.  It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, voluntary service providers and parents through their umbrella organisations.  At regional level there are Regional Leads for the Programme in each of the four HSE Regions. Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of Local Implementation Groups.  These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The active engagement of stakeholders is a critical element of any change process and implementation of the Programme will involve broad consultation.  No individual or agency representative will have a veto in this regard.  Information on the Programme has been made available widely through the HSE website, bulletins, workshops, and presentations.  The National Advocacy Unit of the HSE has developed guidelines for the reimbursement of expenses for service users participating in the design, development and delivery of services.  These guidelines apply to the participation of parents in the development of this Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the Local Implementation Groups with the following objectives:<\/p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p> - Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Local Implementation Groups will make informed decisions on the optimum use of existing resources, based on local information about resources and the needs of children in their area.  Children will get access to services within existing resources according to their needs regardless of where they go to school.  It is the Local Implementation Groups that will decide how best to phase in the changes in accordance with local conditions.  Significant progress has been made since the Programme was established in 2010.  The HSE envisages that full implementation of the Programme nationally will take two to three years to complete. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2507,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[53990\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the waiting lists for ear nose and throat services at Kerry General Hospital where currently 739 adults and 427 children are on the waiting list; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that following a validation exercise the figures for County Kerry have increased significantly; if he will ensure that the County Kerry public receive the service they deserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2508,"content":"<p>Immediately following his appointment, the Minister for Health established the Special Delivery Unit, as set out in the Programme for Government.

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months.<\/p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.   In relation to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WREE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2668,"content":"<p>Question No. 672 answered with Question No. 597.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":2670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WREE03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":2669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WREE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":2670,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[53705\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400077#WREE03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide in tabular form all payments made to board members of the National Transport Authority including payments, salaries, expenses, mileage, and other allowances and so on since the 1 of January 2012.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2671,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for\u00a0the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

This adjustment does not envisage any reduction in the overall number of volunteer members, nor enforced retirement of currently serving volunteers.\u00a0Significantly, the review\u00a0recommends retention of the existing geographical base of volunteer membership of the Coast Guard.   My Department is currently developing an Action Plan in response to this and other issues which were raised in the VFM review on the Coast Guard, and a related VFM on the Marine Survey Office. I\u00a0will be seeking Governmental approval in the coming weeks for this Action Plan. In relation to the amalgmation of\u00a0Coast Guard units, while there may be merit on the basis outlined within the VFM review, I will not be proposing to Government to force Volunteer Coast Guard Units to amalgmate against the wishes of the volunteers themselves. Any such amalgmation would only be on the basis that it was supported by the membership of both units.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Volunteer Units in Ballycotton and Guileen, they\u00a0are very close to each other, approximately\u00a0ten miles apart, and the Coast Guard managment is considering how the local Coast Guard serives might be developed through\u00a0bringing the two Units\u00a0together. All Coast Guard teams are shoreline search units and are also equipped with modern blue light emergency response vehicles.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Ballycotton is also a highly specialised Cliff Rescue Unit. The Coast Guard recognises the importance of retaining a vibrant Cliff Rescue facility for east Cork coupled with a Shoreline Search unit in the coastline area between the east side of Cork Harbour\u00a0and Knockadoon Head. <\/p><p>  Coast Guard management are consulting with the two units with a view to developing an amalgamation plan\u00a0supported by members of both Units that retains the existing geographical membership base. Should this result in the successful amalgamation of the two units it would afford existing and new members from the Guileen area an opportunity to develop additional skills in Cliff rescue and facilitate the development of a fit for purpose building serving the combined needs of the area. A single Cliff Rescue and Search Unit would provide for an enhanced capacity to provide a more effective life-saving response in the area coupled with an increased capacity to support\u00a0 the other statutory land based emergency services.<\/p><p>  However, as outlined above and as I have discussed with the Deputy previously, Volunteer Units will not be amalgmated against the will of the membership of those units.

This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos.  It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons.

However, a specific implementation plan for the strategy had not previously been developed. This Government is now addressing this.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme for Government states that &#8220;<i>the Government will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources and ensure whole of government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector&#8221;.  <\/i>I have established and am personally chairing a new group to develop a realistic implementation plan for progressing the Strategy, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. The new Group has replaced the previous National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group while maintaining the cross-departmental focus and the collaboration with stakeholders. The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group comprises representatives from across Government, a representative from the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of the Implementation Plan is, through engaging with the disability sector and building on the traditional problem-solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector, to make progress to achieve our common interests.  More targeted, innovative and flexible services, designed and delivered on the basis of the evidence drawn from systematic evaluation will help ensure that available resources, which are of course diminished across Government due to the current economic climate, are used to deliver services that meet the needs of the community as efficiently and effectively as possible.  This Implementation Plan will seek to ensure these resources are used as effectively as possible in ensuring that the living standards and access to essential services for people with disabilities are maintained.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Implementation Plan is developing well with the identification by Departments of actions, timelines and Key Performance Indicators. Discussions are ongoing between the Disability Stakeholders Group and Government Departments in an effort to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. At the most recent meeting of the Implementation Group on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> of November it was agreed that every effort will be made to finalise the Plan at the next meeting of the Group which will be held in Quarter 1 of 2013. Once agreed, the Plan will be published as soon as possible thereafter.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Disability Authority is helping Departments in setting performance indicators and outcomes for the Plan&#8217;s targets and have held one-on-one meetings with Departments to assist them in identifying actions to be included in the Implementation Plan. Work by the Authority in relation to Disability Indicators is also at an advanced stage and will be signed off by the Senior Official&#8217;s Group and the Disability Stakeholder Group shortly. These indicators will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the plan translate into improved quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the process of developing the Implementation Plan, the identification and recording of actions which will be required in order to ensure that Ireland will be in compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when ratification takes place is also being undertaken. Each action in the Plan will be linked to the Article of the Convention and obligations therein which will be met through implementation of that action.<\/p><p><br \/>  Outside of the Implementation Group, I also convened a Disability Forum, under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority, to ensure the voices of people with disabilities, their needs and concerns are being heard. The first meeting of the Disability Forum, which was attended by over 300 people with disabilities, their carers, and family members was held on the 19<sup>th<\/sup> of June this year and a report of the views expressed will be published shortly.

Currently, RIA accommodates 4,822 asylum seekers at 35 accommodation centres throughout the State.  I do not accept the premise of the question that persons residing in the Direct Provision system are in extreme poverty.  The system is essentially cashless but no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; residents receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.<\/p><p>  To elaborate on these services,  it is worth noting the following.  Accommodation in reception and accommodation centres is provided on a full board basis which includes the provision of a room \/ family room (as appropriate) and three meals per day as well as school lunches.  All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State.  Residents are paid a weekly direct provision allowance.  In addition, asylum seekers can access exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowances. Parents may also apply for payments to allow their children to avail of school activities, sports and other activities. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework.<\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.<\/p><p>  An issue to be acknowledged is the length of time spent in the direct provision system. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":2807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reorganisation","counter":2806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU03850"},{"type":"question","counter":2807,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[53919\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if the changes to the Reserve Defence Forces is causing major hardship particularly now with having to travel to Athlone from Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2808,"content":"<p>The Report of the VFM Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was recently published, concluded that the current Reserve organisation required radical reform.  The current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that for which the organisational structures were designed.  The Permanent Defence Force (PDF) support framework for the Reserve was, therefore, inefficient and the retention of the current numbers of full time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was no longer sustainable within a strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel.<\/p><p>  A central recommendation from the VFM Steering Committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide, based in PDF barracks and in 16 other locations.  This requires consolidation of existing Reserve Units throughout the country into a smaller number of full-strength Units.  You will appreciate that this smaller number of full sized Units, outside of PDF installations, must cover the entire country.  Amongst other considerations, the selection of locations for these Units sought to ensure continued opportunities for people throughout the country to serve in the Reserve.<\/p><p>  A new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept will see PDF Units having Reserve components, rather than a separate stand-alone Reserve as at present.  This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve.  Reserve Units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF Unit and the 16 Units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  All Reserve Combat Support and Combat Service Support components will be co-located with their PDF &lsquo;Parent Unit&rsquo;.  Reserve personnel will be afforded the opportunity to apply for positions in the new organisational structure that best suits their individual circumstances.  Every effort will be made to accommodate personnel within their geographic location and retraining will be available if required.  Whilst there will inevitably be disruption for certain individual members of the Reserve, this re-organisation is necessary in order to ensure the future viability of the Reserve.  The contribution of all members of the Reserve is valued by Government and I sincerely hope that all current members will continue to serve in the new organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure","counter":2809,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU04050"},{"type":"question","counter":2810,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[53828\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400078#WRU04100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"in respect of the October Exchequer returns, the reason the capital spending for his Department was &euro;2m below profile for this period; his plans to ensure that the full capital spending is implemented before the end of the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2811,"content":"<p> The variance between profiled and actual expenditure to the end of October 2012 is largely due to some of the more significant projects in the capital building programme for this year not progressing as originally scheduled.

On the basis of the volume of appeals received to date, it is reasonable to envisage the work of the DAS Appeals Committee being finalised early in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crawfish Regulations","counter":2969,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2970,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[54434\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding crawfish and the rules and regulations surrounding the catching of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2971,"content":"<p>Council Regulation (EC) No. 850\/98 presently imposes an EU minimum landing size (MLS) for crawfish of 95mm, but was originally enacted as a MLS of 110mm.  The EU Regulation was changed with effect from May 2001 to specify the present EU MLS of 95mm.  The EU Regulation permits Member States to enact national measures supplementing or going beyond the minimum requirements specified in the EU Regulation, provided they are restricted to the Member State&rsquo;s own fishing vessels or to persons established in that Member State.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 232 of 2006) prohibit the landing, transhipment, retention on board, or sale of crawfish below the national minimum landing size of 110mm.  Ireland enacted this higher national MLS in 2001 as it was considered that the lower EU MLS introduced in 2001 offered no conservation protection for the species which was suffering from severe over-fishing.  In addition to the national MLS, the Crawfish (Fisheries Management and Conservation) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 233 of 2006) prohibit the fishing for, retention on board or landing of crawfish caught by nets in two specified areas off the coasts of Kerry and Galway.<\/p><p>  My Department was notified in December 2010 of a complaint received through the EU PILOT system alleging that Ireland&rsquo;s national regulations for the management of the crawfish stock were in breach of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850\/98, were discriminatory and were anti-competitive.  My Department responded in detail to the Commission refuting the allegations made and the Commission closed the PILOT case in December 2011, subject to receipt of a copy of the report of a review I had initiated of the management arrangements for Crawfish and submission to the Commission of any amending national regulations arising.<\/p><p>  On 24 May 2011, I announced that I had asked BIM and the Marine Institute to conduct a review of Ireland&rsquo;s technical conservation measures for crawfish, having regard to the negative and declining state of the crawfish stock, the undesirable by-catch of non-target and possibly protected species from the use of nets by some fishermen in fishing for crawfish, the apparent market preference for smaller crawfish, and the range of technical conservation measures for crawfish used internationally.  The Review was conducted in consultation with crawfish fishermen, shellfish buyers and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  On 14 February 2012, I received the report of the Review, together with a more detailed scientific examination of the crawfish stock from the Marine Institute.  The Review Report is available on BIM&rsquo;s website.  I will arrange for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.  The Review Report made 7 recommendations for the future management of the stock.  It concluded that a reduction in the MLS to the EU minimum level of 95mm would lead to a circa 42% reduction in the reproductive potential of the stock and therefore could not be recommended unless this loss of reproductive potential was compensated by the introduction of a maximum landing size of 120mm.  This alternative measure would prohibit the landing of crawfish in excess of 120mm to create a reservoir of reproducing adult crawfish.  However, the Review identified significant risks in this alternative approach and said it could be recommended only in combination with the introduction of a mechanism to monitor and effectively control and, if necessary, reduce fishing effort on crawfish and then only in areas where it has been demonstrated that there is no discard mortality of crawfish in excess of the maximum landing size.  Having considered these recommendations I consider retention of the present MLS of 110mm to be appropriate at this time.  In this context, it is worth noting that the Review found that 110mm is in fact the most commonly adopted MLS in Northern Europe.<\/p><p>  The Review also emphasised the importance of retaining the crawfish netting prohibitions off Kerry and Galway and recommended that their coverage and the introduction of new closed areas be considered in 2012 in light of new or changed designations for cetaceans under the Habitats Directive.  It recommended that regulations governing the closed areas (S.I. 233 of 2006) be updated to enhance enforcement and my Department is presently working on this task.  Finally, it recommended the enhancement of monitoring of by-catch of cetaceans and seals in tangle nets in Natura 2000 sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":2972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2973,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[54489\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the proposals, if any, he has put forward in relation to the need to put in place effective market support measures to deal with price volatility in the context of common agricultural policy reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2974,"content":"<p>Effective market support measures begin with an adequate budget.  If we are to ensure that farmers can be supported through periods of extreme price volatility, we have to first of all ensure that the CAP is properly funded.  Accordingly, I have been supporting the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste in their ongoing efforts to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible in the negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).  We have said that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to freeze the CAP budget at 2013 levels in nominal terms is a reasonable starting point, and at the recent European Council the Taoiseach again strongly defended CAP funding.  Ireland will continue to work with others to get the best possible CAP deal in the MFF.<\/p><p>  As regards the market support measures themselves, the broad thrust of the Commission&rsquo;s CAP reform proposals is, in my view, generally acceptable, in that the proposals strike a good overall balance in providing an effective safety net.  The main support measures, including those of most relevance to Ireland, are retained, and the inclusion of exceptional measures, with flexible triggers, to overcome emergency circumstances is welcome, as are the transitional provisions which provide for the abolition of sugar quotas.  However, I have stated my preference for mandatory rather than the proposed discretionary intervention for beef and veal if the trigger price is reached, and for the continuation of mandatory APS for butter rather than the discretionary mechanism proposed by the Commission, given the role of APS as an important mechanism for easing seasonal supply pressures.  I have also supported colleagues who have indicated that a review of reference prices is warranted in order to bring them up to date with current market realities.<\/p><p>  On sugar quotas, I have been very clear in my support for the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to abolish quotas from 30 September 2015, but I have also made it clear that, in the event that the quota regime is extended, there should be no market control barriers to the re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry, catering for our national requirements.  Another key issue on which I have expressed concern relates to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to strengthen the role of producer organisations, associations of producer organisations and interbranch organisations.  While I agree that measures to strengthen the position of primary producers in the food chain are warranted, I believe we must be careful to ensure that such measures do not in any way prejudice the effective operation of the single market, which is an absolutely fundamental element both of the Treaties and of the CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2976,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[54491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their disadvantaged area aid payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":2977,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[54492\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400081#WRX02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2978,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 537 together.<\/p><p>  The person named is an applicant under both the 2012 Single Payment Scheme and the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that hold funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (CDVEC), has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.<\/p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding.  From January 2013 it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding involving six national organisations to CDYSB.  These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department.  The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC.  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.  Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.<\/p><p>  It  is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves.

Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened.  The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.

It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.

A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013. In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. <\/p><p>  There is no intention to impose financial penalties on hospitals in relation to achieving waiting time targets. The SDU will continue to work with the HSE and the NTPF in order to ensure that waiting time targets are met. The HSE is also continuing to work closely with the hospitals that are operating budget deficits to ensure that the service impact of cost containment is kept to a minimum and to ensure that patient safety remains at the core of all decision making. The focus at all times is to achieve savings by obtaining better value for money and by continuing to introduce efficiencies in how hospitals do their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400082#WRY03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sick Pay Scheme","counter":3051,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400082#WRY03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3052,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[53719\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400082#WRY03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rate of absenteeism for year to date by region; the cost of absenteeism by region broken down by staffing categories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3053,"content":"<p>As a result of Labour Court recommendations, reformed sick leave rules across the public service are being introduced over the next 15 months:<\/p><p>-   A halving of self-certified sick leave to a maximum of seven days in a rolling two-year period.

In this context, the NSP 2012 provides for the replication nationally of the model operational in the HSE's North East Area, managed by the National Counselling Service (NCS), as a way of meeting the requirement to improve access to psychological therapies in Primary Care.  The cost of this extended service has been estimated at &#8364;5 million annually.<\/p><p><br \/>  To implement the model nationally, an additional Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) counsellor will be allocated to each of the 10 National Counselling Services.  These counsellors will work within the NCS, managing the referral process, to ensure that an appropriate referral and counselling match is provided to meet the needs of individuals.  The  10 posts were advertised recently for a national panel.  Interviews have now been completed and the results will be issued shortly.  The start dates for these posts are expected to be in early 2013 to allow for the process of checking references etc.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The actual counselling services required will be procured through the two employment agencies that hold the existing national contracts with the HSE and counsellors will be recruited through a two stage process.  The employment agencies will select counsellors using their own selection process with reference to qualifications and identify them as suitable for the service.  The HSE will then quality assure the proposed counsellors in terms of professional skills and knowledge prior to entering into the service.  Discussions with the contracted agencies have already begun on these points.  It is expected that this new service will begin to be rolled out early next year when the 10 coordinator counsellors are in place.

Notwithstanding this, it is expected that there will be some savings on capital expenditure at year end which will be used to mitigate excess current expenditure, on a once off basis, in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":3103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":3104,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[53842\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the commitment he gave to the members of Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder that a paper would be put to Government urgently which would propose a package of supports to be put in place for those affected by the increased incidence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents here from 2009, connected to vaccination with Pandemrix; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3105,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[53854\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding narcolepsy.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3106,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[53893\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which he plans to present the paper outlining the package of supports being put in place for those affected by Narcolepsy associated with the vaccine Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in the presentation of the paper prior to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann summer recess, again in September 2012 and once again this October; when will he re-establish communication with SOUND; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3107,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[53897\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when will a proposal be put to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann setting out a package of supports for those who developed narcolepsy as a result of vaccination with Pandemrix; the reason for the delay in bringing the proposal to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and when will he re-establish meaningful contact with SOUND","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3108,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[54119\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the paper outlining details of a proposed package of supports for sufferers of narcolepsy will be published","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3109,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[54449\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he hopes to announce the support the State will be providing to those children who have been identified by the final report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee as being adversely affected by the incidence of narcolepsy as a result of a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine administered for the H1N1 flu virus, otherwise known as Swine 'Flu, particularly as the announcement of supports has been delayed on account of a number of factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3110,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581, 583, 588, 590, 628 and 667 together.<\/p><p>  I am committed to bringing a Memorandum to Government setting out the full response to the issue.

The Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, consequently the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has, at present, no remit in relation to inspecting these services.  The Government is however, committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspection of services by HIQA.<\/p><p>  HIQA have developed and published draft National Standards for Residential Centres for People with Disabilities which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  <\/p><p>  My Department has been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed. The 10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved. My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3116,"content":"<p>Question No. 583 answered with Question No. 581.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":3117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":3118,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[53863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400083#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide the number of tenders to date, for home care projects; the estimated numbers for next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3119,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive earlier this year concluded a Procurement Framework for<b><\/b>the provision of certain services in connection with Home Care Package provision.

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &#8364;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting.

Work on the latter regime is being progressed in conjunction with Northern Ireland; preparations are well underway to tender jointly for a health impact assessment to be carried out - a measure that would be key to underpinning any regime of minimum unit pricing given the prospects for such a policy to be challenged.  As minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption.  Moreover, and arising from the Armagh conference, a North South Alcohol Forum has been initiated and has already met for the purposes of developing areas of work to be elaborated.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question relating to the inclusion of alcohol on the agenda of Ireland's Presidency is indeed pertinent given that the prospect for a new European Union Strategy on Alcohol is being discussed at European Union level.

While this work is continuing, the prospects for encompassing work on alcohol during the tenure of Ireland's Presidency are against the backdrop of many competing priorities on the health agenda.While, I am conscious of the need to  develop proposals on the basis of the National Substance Misuse Strategy to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland, there are no plans at this stage to organise an event on alcohol during Ireland's Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Advertising","counter":3165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":3166,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[53952\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the sixith Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Body; his plan to publish same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3167,"qnumday":606,"qnumall":"[53953\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of meetings held by the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3168,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[53954\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide detail of the payments made to the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland to oversee and monitor the Alcohol Marketing, Communications and Sponsorship Codes since the establishment of the Alcohol Marketing, Communications Monitoring Body in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3169,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 605 to 607, inclusive, together.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have seen the sixth report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB) and have approved it for publication.

Some organisations provide services for a specific group of children who have a particular kind of disability, or they only operate in one part of the country.  This means that there is considerable variation in children's access to services within regions and across the country. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Health Service Executive has recognised that the current system lacks equity and acknowledges that there is a need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  To this end it is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This Programme aims to achieve a national unified approach to the delivery of disability services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multi-disciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years.<\/i>  Importantly, while the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises the continuing role of special schools.  It is worth noting that therapy services in the HSE Mid-West region are already delivered through the structure of geographically based multi-disciplinary teams and that this has enabled two Special Schools to access multi-disciplinary supports which had previously not been available.  It is common across Europe and elsewhere to have children seen by their local early intervention and school age services whatever the nature of their disability or developmental delay, for example in Bavaria or in the UK.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is being led by the HSE in partnership with the non-statutory disability organisations, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and associated agencies.  It is supported by a National Co-ordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, voluntary service providers and parents through their umbrella organisations.  At regional level there are Regional Leads for the Programme in each of the four HSE Regions. Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of Local Implementation Groups.  These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The active engagement of stakeholders is a critical element of any change process and implementation of the Programme will involve broad consultation.  No individual or agency representative will have a veto in this regard.  Information on the Programme has been made available widely through the HSE website, bulletins, workshops, and presentations.  The National Advocacy Unit of the HSE has developed guidelines for the reimbursement of expenses for service users participating in the design, development and delivery of services.  These guidelines apply to the participation of parents in the development of this Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the Local Implementation Groups with the following objectives:<\/p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p> - Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Local Implementation Groups will make informed decisions on the optimum use of existing resources, based on local information about resources and the needs of children in their area.  Children will get access to services within existing resources according to their needs regardless of where they go to school.  It is the Local Implementation Groups that will decide how best to phase in the changes in accordance with local conditions.  Significant progress has been made since the Programme was established in 2010.  The HSE envisages that full implementation of the Programme nationally will take two to three years to complete. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400085#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":3179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400086#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3180,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[53990\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400086#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address the waiting lists for ear nose and throat services at Kerry General Hospital where currently 739 adults and 427 children are on the waiting list; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that following a validation exercise the figures for County Kerry have increased significantly; if he will ensure that the County Kerry public receive the service they deserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3181,"content":"<p>Immediately following his appointment, the Minister for Health established the Special Delivery Unit, as set out in the Programme for Government.

This has enabled reporting of Outpatient Waiting Lists from January 2012. Subsequently, waiting times have been published on www.hse.ie each month as part of the HSE Performance Reports. The latest HSE Performance Report for September 2012 shows that the total number of patients waiting for a first time outpatient appointment, as of 18th October is 385,462, 71.1% of whom are waiting less than 12 months.<\/p><p>  Building on the work done by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the collection of outpatient waiting time data. Its methodology replicates the approach taken with the collection of inpatient and day case waiting times. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format, revealing the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals, allows the SDU and the NTPF, in the first instance, to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.   Over the course of 2013-2015 the HSE together with the SDU and the HSE Clinical Programmes intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &lsquo;do not attend&rsquo; rates and appropriate discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  A maximum waiting time target of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by Nov 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.   In relation to the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400088#WREE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3341,"content":"<p>Question No. 672 answered with Question No. 597.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":3343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400088#WREE03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":3342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400088#WREE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":3343,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[53705\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120400088#WREE03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide in tabular form all payments made to board members of the National Transport Authority including payments, salaries, expenses, mileage, and other allowances and so on since the 1 of January 2012.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":3344,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for\u00a0the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

This adjustment does not envisage any reduction in the overall number of volunteer members, nor enforced retirement of currently serving volunteers.\u00a0Significantly, the review\u00a0recommends retention of the existing geographical base of volunteer membership of the Coast Guard.   My Department is currently developing an Action Plan in response to this and other issues which were raised in the VFM review on the Coast Guard, and a related VFM on the Marine Survey Office. I\u00a0will be seeking Governmental approval in the coming weeks for this Action Plan. In relation to the amalgmation of\u00a0Coast Guard units, while there may be merit on the basis outlined within the VFM review, I will not be proposing to Government to force Volunteer Coast Guard Units to amalgmate against the wishes of the volunteers themselves. Any such amalgmation would only be on the basis that it was supported by the membership of both units.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Volunteer Units in Ballycotton and Guileen, they\u00a0are very close to each other, approximately\u00a0ten miles apart, and the Coast Guard managment is considering how the local Coast Guard serives might be developed through\u00a0bringing the two Units\u00a0together. All Coast Guard teams are shoreline search units and are also equipped with modern blue light emergency response vehicles.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Ballycotton is also a highly specialised Cliff Rescue Unit. The Coast Guard recognises the importance of retaining a vibrant Cliff Rescue facility for east Cork coupled with a Shoreline Search unit in the coastline area between the east side of Cork Harbour\u00a0and Knockadoon Head. <\/p><p>  Coast Guard management are consulting with the two units with a view to developing an amalgamation plan\u00a0supported by members of both Units that retains the existing geographical membership base. Should this result in the successful amalgamation of the two units it would afford existing and new members from the Guileen area an opportunity to develop additional skills in Cliff rescue and facilitate the development of a fit for purpose building serving the combined needs of the area. A single Cliff Rescue and Search Unit would provide for an enhanced capacity to provide a more effective life-saving response in the area coupled with an increased capacity to support\u00a0 the other statutory land based emergency services.<\/p><p>  However, as outlined above and as I have discussed with the Deputy previously, Volunteer Units will not be amalgmated against the will of the membership of those units.
