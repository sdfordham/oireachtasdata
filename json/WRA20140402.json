The full list of all sites can be found on Tourism Ireland's website.

These services have made a concrete difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas, reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their statutory entitlements locally.  Since 2003, the Emigrant Support Programme has provided more than &euro;114 million in grants to Irish community and voluntary organisations, of which &euro;86 million has been provided to more than 200 organisations in Britain.   This funding has been directed primarily at frontline welfare services, working to support those made vulnerable by health, age or dislocation. In 2013 approximately 80% of the grants paid in Britain were made to organisations providing welfare and information services to the Irish community.  The organisations funded provide a range of services from informal community networking groups for seniors, to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements. <\/p><p>  A substantial portion of ESP funding in Britain is provided to a number of organisations primarily focussed on helping those who have fallen on hard times by tackling the problems of homelessness and addiction.  These include Ashford Place (formerly Cricklewood Homeless Concern), the Safe Start Foundation in Middlesex, the London Irish Centre, the Luton Irish Forum and the NOAH Enterprise (Luton) in the London area and Monica's Place in Birmingham amongst others. <\/p><p>  Our support continues to evolve.

In this regard, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the details of the film tax relief scheme are contained in Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This is supplemented by the Film Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 357 of 2008) which govern the administration of the scheme. <\/p><p><b>Criteria to be fulfilled by a qualifying film company<\/b><\/p><p>  Under the provisions of section 481, an individual or company investing in a qualifying film, to be produced by a qualifying company, is entitled to claim tax relief in respect of that investment.  For this purpose, a qualifying company is an Irish incorporated and resident company, or a company which is carrying on a trade in the State through a branch or agency.  The company must exist solely for the production and distribution of one, and only one, qualifying film.  A film company seeking Section 481 finance cannot have in its name the words &quot;Ireland&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot;, &quot;Eireann&quot;, &quot;Eire&quot;, or &quot;National&quot;.<\/p><p>  \u00a0In order to be regarded as a qualifying film, a film must meet the requirements of section 481 including criteria set out by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to the contribution which the production of the film is expected to make to, either or both of, the development of the film industry in the State and the promotion and expression of Irish culture.  On receipt of confirmation from the Minister that the film meets these criteria, the Revenue Commissioners then undertake a detailed examination of the application to ensure that the project complies with the other statutory requirements.  Where they are so satisfied, the Commissioners then issue a certificate in respect of the investments authorising tax relief in an amount not exceeding the lowest of:<blockquote>- eligible expenditure, which is generally the amount spent on the employment of eligible individuals and goods, services and facilities in the State,<br \/><br \/>- 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or<br \/><br \/>- &euro;50million.<\/blockquote><b>Verification and Auditing Procedures<\/b><\/p><p>  Prior to certification of a film, Revenue examine the application to ensure that:<blockquote>- the requirements of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 have been complied with;<br \/><br \/>- contractual arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the production company has the rights to make the film;<br \/><br \/>- the project appears to be commercially viable;<br \/><br \/>- full budget details have been provided; and<br \/><br \/>- declarations are received from the company directors that there are no issues that might impact upon the conditions for relief under S481. <\/blockquote>  \u00a0Within 4 months of the completion of a film, a qualifying company is required to notify Revenue of the date of completion of the film and to provide 2 copies of the film to both Revenue and the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  At the same time, the company is also required to provide a compliance report to Revenue in relation to the film.  This compliance report contains, inter alia, a declaration from the directors of the production company confirming compliance with the conditions of the relief as well as a detailed line-by-line analysis of the budget for the film, identifying and giving reasons for any variations from the budget initially submitted.  These declarations must be accompanied by a declaration from an independent auditor who is also required to verify the amount spent on the film.<\/p><p>  \u00a0All of the information submitted is examined by Revenue to ensure compliance with the section 481 requirements.  Where the certification of the film was made subject to specific conditions, Revenue will also examine the information to ensure that the company complied with the conditions.  In addition to the examination of compliance submissions, Revenue may also audit the returns of film producer and production companies as part of their normal audit activities.<\/p><p><b>Number of persons employed in the production of qualifying films<\/b><\/p><p>  Files maintained by the Revenue Commissioners provide data on the number of individuals who are scheduled to work on productions in a given year.  These show that in 2013, just over 27,000 individual employments were generated on film productions supported by Section 481 relief.  This includes approximately 20,000 employments as extras on these productions.  However, this data does not show whether an individual spent a full year, a week or a day working on the production of a qualifying film.  Similarly, an individual may have worked on a number of productions and would be counted in respect of each production.  For this reason, it is not possible to estimate the number of full-time equivalent employees from the Revenue information. <\/p><p><b>New Film Scheme<\/b><\/p><p>  The Deputy should also note that the Finance Act 2013 introduced changes to give Film Relief a new focus.  These changes are subject to a commencement order and, in the last Budget, I signalled my intention to bring the new arrangements into operation on 1 January 2015.<\/p><p>  Under the existing film relief scheme, an investor may claim tax relief in respect of an investment in a qualifying company.  The tax relief is granted at the investor's marginal rate of tax on the full amount of their investment.  Under the new provisions, the delivery mechanism of the incentive will change.  Relief will not, in the future, be available to investors in qualifying films.  Instead a payable Corporation Tax credit of 32% will be paid directly by the Revenue Commissioners to a Producer Company, who produces a qualifying film. <\/p><p>  The amount of the credit will be 32% of the lowest of:<blockquote> - eligible expenditure, which is generally the amount spent on the employment of eligible individuals and goods, services and facilities in the State,<br \/><br \/> - 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or<br \/><br \/> - &euro;50million.<\/blockquote>  \u00a0The legislation provides for measures to ensure that, in the event that the qualifying company does not satisfy the statutory conditions or the conditions imposed by a film certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners, any amount paid by the Commissioners can be recouped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200055#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200055#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[15629\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200055#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on plans to introduce a grant towards the fuel costs of disabled drivers and disabled passengers including the likely start date; the value of the grant that will be paid to eligible persons; the rules and criteria that it is envisioned will govern eligibility and the administration of the scheme; and the anticipated total annual cost of the scheme.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in April 2013 and subsequent negotiations with the European Commission, the excise relief on fuel element of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme will be discontinued\u00a0from the 31st December 2014.

This covers statistics for both 2013 and 2014 (to February 2014).<\/p><p>\u00a0In relation to Question No. 66, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the provision whereby liability for LPT in respect of residential properties valued at over &euro;1m is established by applying a rate of 0.18%<b><\/b>to<b><\/b>the first &euro;1m in value and 0.25% to the portion of the value above &euro;1m.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent data published by them shows that about 0.2% of properties have been valued for LPT purposes in excess of &euro;1m on a self assessment basis.\u00a0 On that basis, it is estimated that some &euro;2.5m additional tax was collected for 2013 that is attributable to the 0.25% rate on that part of the property valuations in excess of &euro;1m.\u00a0 It is reasonable to conclude that the final figure for 2014 is likely to be double the 2013 amount, however it is not possible to be definitive at this stage about amounts collected to date for 2014 at the 0.25% rate. <\/p><p>  \u00a0Regarding Questions Nos. 67,68 and 69, as indicated in the Revenue Commissioner's statistics, there are about 18,700 properties where deferrals have been claimed and around 28,300 claims for exemptions among the returns processed to date.  These equate to about 1.2% and 1.8% of properties returned respectively.\u00a0 These figures are primarily based on claims submitted by property owners in their LPT returns.  As the Deputy notes, earlier forecasts predicted that the level of deferrals and exemptions could be substantially higher.  These figures were estimated prior to the implementation of LPT.  While considerable effort may have been put into initial estimates of possible levels of exemption and deferral, the impact of the actual exemption and deferral provisions could not be accurately determined until the returns process has been completed. <\/p><p>  \u00a0It should be noted that deferral is a personal choice issue for property owners and some, although they meet the conditions of deferral, may opt to pay the tax if their means allow it.\u00a0 Consequently, even if the number of potential eligible cases were known in advance with accuracy, it would not have been possible to estimate the number that would actually apply for a deferral.<\/p><p>  Revenue estimates that the compliance rate for 2013 is currently at 93%.  It may be the case that some property owners have not claimed an exemption or a deferral on the misapprehension that they are automatically entitled to one.  It is important for property owners to be aware that they must apply for exemption from LPT or deferral as it will not generally be granted automatically and the Revenue Commissioners advise that this has been a key part of their communications message since the introduction of the tax.<\/p><p>  \u00a0The Deputy will be aware that the deadline for property owners to bring their LPT affairs (including the Household Charge) up to date and avoid interest and penalties was 31 March 2014 and has now been extended to today. \u00a0I am advised by the Commissioners that their current priority is processing the large volume of Returns and payments received and they expect to publish more detailed data and analysis in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200055#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200056#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[15490\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200056#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the safeguards in place within his Department to prevent the prospect of persons who moved properties into the National Asset Management Agency buying them back; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, Section 172 of the NAMA Act precludes NAMA from selling loans or property to a defaulting debtor or to parties connected to a defaulting debtor.\u00a0 In accordance with Section 172 of the Act, purchasers of NAMA loans or secured property are required to sign a statutory declaration that they are not connected to the debtor or other obligors.\u00a0 In addition, NAMA Board guidelines require that sales agents prepare a final report and recommendation, which includes, inter alia, confirmation that the sales agent has reviewed the purchaser s declaration relating to connected party sales and a statement disclosing any commercial relationship between the agent, debtor, purchaser or purchaser s ultimate beneficial owners in the past five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200056#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200056#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[15523\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200056#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify apparent discrepancies in statements from both him and his Minister of State regarding debt resolution for buy-to-let properties; in his own case, the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 208 of 26 March states that the mortgage arrears resolution targets cover both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions with respect to principal dwelling houses and buy-to-lets, whereas the Minister of State at his Department, replying to a Topical Issue debate on 26 March said that the Department's perspective is that mortgage resolution only applies to persons in personal dwellings and does not involve investment properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Accordingly, a key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools identified as having the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant, given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure which limits the capacity for any additionality to the DEIS programme.<\/p><p>  The estimated expenditure on the DEIS programme by my Department in 2014 is &euro;99million which includes funding on DEIS grants and additional teachers in DEIS schools.  Additional funding is provided by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the School Meals Programme and the School Completion Programme respectively. <\/p><p>  I have no immediate plans to carry out a re-assessment of schools.  The current focus of my Department in relation to the DEIS programme is on its ongoing evaluation and on distilling the learning from this research in order to inform future policy on educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>Details of the number of schools built in towns with RAPID areas since the DEIS identification process is as follows:<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Roll No.<\/th><th>School<\/th><th>Year<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>91513S<\/td><td>Youghal Community School, Youghal<\/td><td>2006<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>20295K<\/td><td>Carlow Town Educate Together<\/td><td>2008<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>20294I<\/td><td>North Drogheda Environs,Drogheda<\/td><td>2008<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>70650L<\/td><td>Athy Community  College<\/td><td>2009<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>19858V<\/td><td>Gaelscoil Dara, Galway Cit<\/td><td>2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>17064U<\/td><td>Scoil Phadraig, Ballylinan, Athy<\/td><td>2013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>20259G<\/td><td>St. Francis' NS, Dundalk<\/td><td>2013<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[15522\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the options available to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry to further their education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.

Pupils with Down syndrome may receive additional teaching support in schools, either from a school's general allocation of Learning Support\/Resource Teaching, or from an allocation of additional Resource Teacher hours to the schools from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).<\/p><p>  Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools.  Many children with Down syndrome have access to such SNA support.  Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology support which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats. <\/p><p>  With regard to the admissions process to schools, on 25th March, the Government approved the drafting of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014.  This new legislation aims to ensure that the enrolment process in all primary and post-primary schools is inclusive, transparent and fair.  Among the provisions in the new Bill, will be a requirement for all schools to make an explicit statement in their admissions policy that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability.<\/p><p>  In relation to admission to higher education, the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities.  Eighteen higher education institutions are currently participating in the scheme.  For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie. <\/p><p>  To assist pupils to then attend third level education, core funding for access programmes for pupils with disabilities is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution.  This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities.  Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005.  In addition, many institutions have a dedicated Disability Support Service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) also provides additional funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.<\/p><p>  With regard to alternative forms of testing and evaluation, I wish to advise the Deputy that secondary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate.  Candidates with disabilities, including Down syndrome, can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations.  Details of the reasonable accommodations that can be made for pupils with special educational needs is available at www.examinations.ie. <\/p><p>  In relation to standardised testing, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment guidelines on &quot;Assessment in the Primary School Curriculum &ndash; Guidelines for Schools&quot; provides general guidance for schools including on using alternative tests in relation to the standardised testing of pupils in primary schools.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the recent NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model.  Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training Provision","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[15530\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans regarding the training of undergraduate level teaching staff for persons with Down's syndrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department allocates significant  resources to ensure that pupils with special educational needs, including  pupils with Down syndrome, can participate fully in education.  Supports are  provided for schools in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified  professional teachers, Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, the appropriate  school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. <\/p><p>  In relation to initial teacher education, while special education has long been a feature of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, the Teaching Council, the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers, requires the reconceptualised and extended Bachelor of Education  programmes which commenced in 2012, to address a number of specific elements including differentiation, inclusive education including special education and  literacy and numeracy.  The learning outcomes of these programmes indicate that the graduate teacher should be able to conduct a systematic, holistic  assessment of learner needs, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of  students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to set clear, challenging and achievable  expectations for pupils, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant  outcomes.  Student teachers may also have access to additional elective courses with content focussing on special education. <\/p><p>  All primary teachers are qualified to teach in any primary or special school  classroom.  Teachers have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to continuing professional development.  My Department also funds a number of Post-Graduate Programmes for teachers involved in Learning Support and Special  Education.  These programmes are specifically designed to assist all schools and  educational services in meeting the needs of students requiring learning support and the teaching of students with special educational needs.  Since 2007, some 2,000 teachers have completed these programmes.  I am satisfied that current arrangements are adequate to ensure that teachers receive the necessary initial education and have access to quality continuous professional development programmes during their career so that they are in a  position to meet the needs of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200058#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":207,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200059#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[15564\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200059#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will confirm that his Department will not pay any non-binding pay recommendations (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>I can confirm that agreement has been reached under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on terms of reference for an internal job evaluation exercise to be carried out within a specified timescale in UCC to establish the correct rate of pay for the employees of all grades within the Tyndall National Institute.

In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.<\/p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures.<\/p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns of smaller schools and rural schools.  Our overall primary school enrolment has been growing rapidly in recent years and this is going to continue.  In managing the resource consequences of this, it is important that decisions on school provision and organisation are based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.<\/p><p>  Educational quality for the pupils has to be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and of course there are wider social and cultural factors that need to be considered.  Given our population growth, we have increasing enrolment at all levels of education which is expected to continue in the medium term.  Many pupil places are required in areas that currently have no school provision at all and we have schools in areas of stable or declining population with relatively low pupil numbers.<\/p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type.  I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200061#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200061#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[15661\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200061#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when e-fibre broadband will be available to schools (details supplied) County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>At the time when St Columba's and St Luke's schools were awarded their current broadband connections next generation access (NGA) was not available in their area.

When the Council's programme of coastal protection and flood defence projects is received by the OPW it will be reviewed having regard to related guidance issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the local authorities.  The OPW has written to the local authorities indicating that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200062#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200062#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[15671\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200062#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the projected opening date for Skellig Michael; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>As I indicated in my reply to Question<font color=\"#4F4F4F\"> No. 355, Ref No: 8715\/14, <\/font>on 25 February last, the opening date for Skellig Michael this year is 16th May.

The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the client.  The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles.  In addition, the cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year with the number of eligible clients also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared with almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra clients became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. <\/p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is key in protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to preserve these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.  Accordingly, the telephone allowance was abolished from 1 January 2014.   I am not in a position to reinstate the allowance. <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department's clients and particularly those who are living alone. In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week.  While the decision to abolish the telephone allowance was a difficult one, it allowed my Department to fully maintain the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. The tenant's engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. There is no contractual relationship established between the landlord and the Department.<\/p><p>  The Equal Status Acts 2000-2011, prohibit discrimination in the provision of services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector including lettings and accommodation.

Refusal by landlords to accept tenants, including those in receipt of rent supplement, under any of these grounds would be in breach of the equality legislation.<\/p><p>  The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.<\/p><p>  A breakdown of rent supplement expenditure in Dublin by postal code is not available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200064#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200064#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[15524\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200064#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding jobseeker's allowance in resect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>The person concerned changed address and the file was forwarded to a social welfare inspector for investigation as a new means assessment had to be carried out.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.50%).  <\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would therefore be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200066#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200066#WRQ00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Visits","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200066#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[15484\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200066#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of Irish entertainers that offered their services to perform at the upcoming State visit of President Higgins to England; the criteria used for the selection of the artists; the number that were selected; if those not selected will be notified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p><i>Ceili&uacute;radh<\/i>, a special evening of music, spoken word and dance, featuring artists from Ireland and the United Kingdom, will take place in the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday 10th April, 2014 to mark the historic occasion of the first State Visit by the President of Ireland to the United Kingdom.

It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.<\/p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.<\/p><p>  The Group comprises County Managers from Monaghan and Cavan County Councils, the Director of Leisure, Development and Arts from Fermanagh District Council, representatives from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Strategic Investment Board, Waterways Ireland and senior officials from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Northern Ireland and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. <\/p><p>The Inter-Agency Group has met four times, last meeting on 9 December 2013.

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of commercial websites as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing-a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a total of 10 locations in County Longford, 19 locations in County Westmeath and 39 locations in County Kildare before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss these further with the Deputies concerned. <\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200067#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[15474\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200067#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding broadband in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>The broadband service contracted under National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is a basic, affordable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme.

","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got relatively early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<\/p><p>  There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. As of 1 March 2014 waiting times for a first consultation were less than one month for all applicants at two law centres operating triage. On 1 March there were 112 people waiting at these centres representing 5% of the total numbers waiting for a first consultation at centres operating triage.<\/p><p>  While the Board aims for all applicants to receive a triage appointment within one month, in <i>O&rsquo;Donoghue v Legal Aid Board<\/i> ([2006] 4 IR 204) the High Court held that four months was not an unreasonable time for an applicant to wait for legal services. In eight centres operating triage waiting times for a first consultation are less than four months. Approximately 31% of the applicants who were waiting for a service at a law centre operating triage as of 1<sup><\/sup>  March will receive a service within four months. There are also four further centres that do not operate triage on the basis that their waiting time for a substantive appointment with a solicitor is under four months.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the Board operates a &ldquo;priority&rdquo; service in certain cases. Where a priority service is offered for the particular case type applicants are given the first available appointment with a solicitor. Details of the case types that are treated as priority are listed below. During February 2014, 15% of the total numbers who received a first consultation were given an early appointment on the basis of the matter being priority.<\/p><p>Priority is given to applicants seeking legal services in the following categories of cases:-<\/p><p>- child abduction proceedings; <\/p><p>- where there is a real danger of children being taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant;<\/p><p>- proceedings on foot of Part IV of the Child Care Act 1991 or applicants presenting with cases that involve a risk of such proceedings; <\/p><p>- domestic violence;<\/p><p>- where a maintenance debtor has been served with a summons \/ warrant on foot of section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and  Children) Act 1976, has appeared in Court and has applied for civil legal aid having been advised of his\/her entitlement to do so by the Judge;<\/p><p>- where, under the Statute of Limitations, there is a danger that the time limits for issuing proceedings may expire unless immediate action is taken;<\/p><p>- where there is a danger of time limits expiring; <\/p><p>- where there is a danger that assets may be reduced \/ disposed of so that they would be unavailable to meet the claims of the applicant; <\/p><p>- District Court and Circuit Court appeals, where the case has been dealt with through the private practitioner service and services are now being sought from the law centre;<\/p><p>- legal services for complainants in rape and certain sexual assault cases;  <\/p><p>- legal aid for persons in respect of whom a sex offenders order is being sought; <\/p><p>- where the other party&rsquo;s nationality, domicile or habitual residence enables them to seek a similar remedy in another jurisdiction and the applicant is likely to be prejudiced if he\/she does not initiate proceedings first;<\/p><p>- asylum cases; and<\/p><p>- managing solicitors retain a residual discretion to provide a priority service in other cases where, having regard to the particular case concerned, as compared with other applications on the applications record, and to their own knowledge and experience, they consider that it is appropriate that a particular applicant be given specific priority over other applicants for legal services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200069#WRT00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fixed Charge Processing System","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200069#WRT00950"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[15583\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200069#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is now a mechanism in place to inform all offenders of the cancellation petition policy of the fixed charge processing system as contained in recommendation 3.10 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report entitled The Fixed Charge Processing System: A 21st Century Strategy.

The Irish Prison Service phone system keeps a log of all landline calls made to and from individual prisons and headquarters but this is a log only, containing data such as the number dialled from, number dialled, date and time of call, and duration.<\/p><p>  At present, the Prisoner Phone System records all prisoner calls with the exception of two call channels which are left unrecorded. These are channel 1 which is assigned to the prisoner&rsquo;s solicitor and channel 99 which is assigned to the Samaritans.  The prisoner is fully aware of the fact that they are recorded as his\/her consent is given on his\/her nomination form which he\/she signs shortly after committal.  This is in accordance with rule 46 of the Prison Rules, 2007. <\/p><p>  On Tuesday 1 April, I was informed of an anomaly whereby 139 prisoners currently in custody had, or previously had, more than one solicitor on the Prisoner Phone System and who had their phone calls to the second solicitor inadvertently recorded as they were outside the restriction parameters that were then in place on the system.  This anomaly has potentially been in place since July 2010 when the current Phone System was introduced.  Since the introduction of this system, a total of 2,842 calls between a prisoner and a second solicitor have been recorded. 1,749 such calls relate to the 139 prisoners currently in custody who have or who previously had a second solicitor listed on the system. <\/p><p>  In these cases, and with immediate effect, the Irish Prison Service took steps to ensure that all previously recorded calls were made inaccessible to staff members.  In addition, action was immediately taken on the Prisoner Telephone System to prevent staff adding multiple solicitors to the system.  An interim measure has been put in place to deal with this matter and it is expected that a permanent solution will be in place within a number of weeks.<\/p><p>  I can further advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service have confirmed that the content of any of the inadvertently<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>recorded phone calls has never been made available to any third party including any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In order for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get copies of any recorded phone conversations by prisoners, they need to firstly make an application at Superintendent level to the Irish Prison Service providing the specific details and reasons that they require same.  The Irish Prison Service have categorically stated that they have never approved the provision of a copy of a prisoner&rsquo;s phone calls to his\/her solicitor to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under any circumstances.<\/p><p>  The Irish Prison Service intends to write to the solicitors of the prisoners who are affected to inform them of this situation and to apologise for the inadvertent recording of the calls. <\/p><p>  Finally, I have asked the Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent independent investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the recording of telephone conversations between prisoners and their solicitors.  The Inspector has been asked to carry out his investigation pursuant to section 31 of the Prisons Act, 2007 and to submit his report to me as soon as possible.

","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73\/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. <\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer's entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer's Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200072#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200072#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[15519\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200072#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a person who has no single farm payment entitlements but has been applying for the disadvantaged areas scheme for the past five years will automatically be allocated entitlements in 2015; the value of such allocated entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The so called Scottish derogation only allows for the allocation of entitlements to farmers who <b><i>never<\/i><\/b> held entitlements, either owned or leased, but who were actively farming in 2013.

When taken in conjunction with the allocation of funding for LEADER measures, this represents a fund of over &euro;4 billion for investment in rural development measures in the period to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200072#WRW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200073#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[15573\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040200073#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the designated agency or person to be contacted by citizens seeking information regarding the EU's Maritime and Fisheries Fund 2014-2020.

The enactment, through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, of amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 underpins a number of key reforms being introduced as part of the Pre-School Quality Agenda.  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these are currently being considered.  Following the introduction of the Child and Family Agency Act 2014 the inspection of pre-schools and the enforcement of the Regulations are now the responsibility of the new Child and Family Agency. <\/p><p>  Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides for exemptions to the requirements of Part VII of the said Act, including childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families, who are not subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006.   This exemption recognises parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  Such childminders are encouraged to voluntarily register their service with their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both registered and voluntarily registered childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. My Department will continue to actively promote the voluntary registration of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes. However, the Department is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations.<\/p><p>  Childcare services subject to the Regulations are required to obtain Garda vetting for all childcare workers.

My Department is also considering a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport to ensure that investment decisions in the transport sector will in future have a much more rigorous evidence base than was the case in the past and to enable us to prioritise the projects that offer the greatest economic and social return.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  At a European level,\u00a0my Department has been and will continue to actively engage with the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy making.

This\u00a0multi-modal\u00a0EU policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National\u00a0Ports Policy that I launched in March 2013.
