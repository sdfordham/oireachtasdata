Today, Pieta House launched the Mind Our Men campaign, which is its latest initiative on suicide prevention and, in particular, promoting what all of us can do easily in looking out for the men in our lives, be it wives keeping an eye on their husbands, sisters on their brothers, work colleagues on their work colleagues, friends on their friends and so on.  It involves some simple steps, and I ask that Members take a minute today to go on to the Pieta House website today and view the Mind our Men page, which gives some important points people can usefully embrace in what is a challenge that all of us are anxious to meet.<\/p><p>As the Leader is aware, we launched Actions Speak Louder Than Words some weeks ago.  I hope time can be made available after Easter for all Members to debate the merits of that campaign, which was welcomed on either side of the House.  It is important that we adopt such a strategy, which could be improved in some ways if people see fit.<\/p><p>I am sorry to take an adversarial line but this issue must be raised.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, would come to the House today and explain to the House, and ultimately to the people, in particular the people of Meath East, the reason the opening hours of the polls for tomorrow's by-election have been manipulated in such a way as to ensure a low turnout.  This is especially so in the case of areas such as Ratoath and Ashbourne, which in recent years have had the highest increases in population for towns anywhere in the country, and given that the opening time of the polls have been reduced from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. and, incredibly, from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock in the evening, which will disenfranchise the many young families and many of the people who may wish to exercise their democratic right to take a view on the fact that nothing is being done to help them with their negative equity mortgages or to enhance what they are trying to do to mind their children, and that nothing has been done to allow them have their voice.  Instead, it would appear to any objective commentator that what we have is a cynical attempt to manipulate the electoral process to ensure those in the most populous areas, those people who are suffering the most, will not be in a position to cast their vote for whatever candidate, be it the Government candidate, the Sinn F\u00e9in candidate or our own colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne.  One thing is certain.  All of the candidates were entitled to an even playing field, and that has not been afforded to them, which frankly appears to be cynical tampering with and rigging of the electoral process by the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600004#C00100","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1364308500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to Jimmy Walsh on the day we celebrate his long and successful career.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600004#C00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1364308500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I understand that because it was done in a haphazard way last week, it has been proposed by the Leader that we would have tributes to him tomorrow, which would give all of us a chance to pay tribute to his-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600004#C00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1364308500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.

On the basis of data protection concerns, the HSE adopted a policy under which these invaluable records would be destroyed on 31 March.  I am glad that the Minister has set up an expert group to review how best to retain these records while complying with data protection laws.  It is worth saying that other EU countries have similar laws under EU directives but have not been required to destroy such important health records.  Professor David McConnell in Trinity College Dublin, the Irish Heart Foundation and many other groups and individuals expressed strong concerns in recent days about the vandalism, as Professor McConnell put it, of destroying the cards.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter when the expert group reports?  It raises broader issues of data protection and the retention of health records.

Its clients include asset managers, fund administrators, hedge funds, banks, accountancy firms, lawyers, consultants and insurers, everyone and everything that the poor and the socially excluded who play the lottery are not about.

It has only been announced in the past few days and instead of having to transfer body organs immediately, they can be kept alive for a few days, providing a real opportunity to do something about human body transplants.

We must have a property tax and broaden the tax base, as there must be a fund to provide local services.  Residents around the country cannot believe what is happening, as bills are emanating like confetti from the Revenue Commissioners.  They are being sent to children and people who do not live in or even own the house to where the bill is sent.  Moreover, people have a reasonable expectation that if the house in which they live is below standards and has structural faults or if the housing estate is incomplete, there could be a continuing exemption or waiver as seen under the household charge process.  Nevertheless, last week such people woke up to the shocking news that they were being served with notice from the Revenue Commissioners about the property tax.<\/p> <p>This needs to be revisited.  It is unfair and it is important that if the public are to pay the tax, which they should, and if they are to embrace the tax, which is needed to fund local services, it is seen to be fair.<\/p><p>There was a great deal of publicity last week amidst speculation and media reportage that granny flats would incur a separate property charge.  This issue was raised by one of my constituents from Mountmellick.  Granny flats are used by people to look after an elderly relative.  They are usually housed in a converted garage or an annex or extension to a home.  However, having contacted the Revenue, officials have confirmed unequivocally that such flats will not incur a tax in their own right and this, at least, is some relief for householders.<\/p><p>Local authorities will receive 80% of the tax raised and there must be a direct link between the tax and local services.  Thatched dwellings form part of our unique culture and heritage.  There are fewer than 1,000 left in the country with only 30 in County Laois.  Before long there will be none because they are costly to maintain and repair and it is difficult to secure insurance for such dwellings.  However, if ever an exemption from the property tax was necessary, it should be for preserved heritage houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600006#E00300","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364309400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I welcome the suicide prevention strategy for men, Mind our Men, which was published earlier by Pieta House.

They stated that they have had to do so much fire fighting that some of the basic functions have been overlooked.  Some of the statements they were asked to read to the House by their officials on the day-to-day functions of the Department of Finance made sorry reading.  The Department, claiming a monopoly on wisdom, refused to do regulatory impact analysis of anything that was in the Finance Bill last week.  They refused to refer it to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Even where documents were sent to Teagasc, the food development authority, they refused to ask Teagasc what it thought of the documents.  The regulatory impact analysis which the Department refused to do is, according to the Government's website, a tool used for the structured exploration of different options to address particular policy issues.  The role of the fiscal council, which they also refused to consult on Thursday, is to independently assess and comment publicly on whether the Government is meeting its stated budgetary targets and objectives.<\/p> <p>Teagasc has a major role to play in developing Food Harvest 2020.

We should take a leaf out of what is happening in other European countries where a budget is debated substantially in advance of the Minister's address.  Effectively, the Minister's address is a summing up of what has been decided by parliament.  The Seanad has made an effort to hold significant debates ahead of the budget, as we did this year and last year, and I commend the Leader on arranging same.  There should be a significant policy re-calibration whereby Parliament discusses the budget in detail, brings in whatever expert groups necessary to advise accordingly, and then supplies a budget recommendation to the Minister for Finance.  That would be a sea change in the approach to the budget which has traditionally been the starting point of the discussion on the Finance Bill.

Last June European leaders agreed to break the vicious circle between banking and sovereign debts.  With this aim in mind we also agreed that the European Stability Mechanism could be used to recapitalise banks directly.  This remains the stated policy and position of the European Heads of State and Government.  This is why Ireland is seeking further EU assistance to reduce taxpayers' exposure to our banking system as we hope to get back to the markets soon.  We have been back already.  We will continue this work with our European partners to ensure Ireland is in a position to avail of new recapitalisation tools that are being developed.  A key priority for the Government has been to ease the bank-debt burden on Irish taxpayers and to clean up our banks in order to support the economic recovery.  As I recently stated, the policy on socialising the cost of private bank failure by bailing out bank bondholders was in the first instance the responsibility of the previous Fianna F\u00e1il Government, but the error was compounded-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600015#P01000","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1364312100,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Come on.

The error was compounded when the continuation of this policy became, in effect, a condition of the 2010 bailout programme required by Brussels and Frankfurt.  If the Senator had waited and listened he would have got the response.  It was feared that allowing a bank in Ireland to default on its debts would unleash panic in the financial markets across the eurozone.  This debt now weighs heavily on Irish taxpayers and in the eyes of investors remains an obstacle to sustained market re-entry.<\/p><p>In dealing with the bank failures in Cyprus and the unique circumstances there, there has been a change of policy at European level.  In Cyprus it has been banks' creditors, including depositors with savings over \u20ac100,000, rather than taxpayers who are being asked to pay for the banking losses.  This change of policy is no longer directly relevant to Ireland.  We have already recapitalised our banks and there is no longer any rationale for imposing loses on any creditors to Irish banks.  It remains the firm Government policy to protect depositors in Irish banks through strong prudential regulation and enforcement.  That is the position on deposits, banking and the bailout for Cyprus.<\/p><p>Senators Bacik and Colm Burke spoke about the Guthrie cards - a matter raised by a number of Senators in recent months.

When that expert group reports I am sure we can have a debate on it in this House.<\/p> <p> Senators O'Donnell, Hayden, Wilson and others raised the proposed sale of the national lottery.  The proceeds from that sale will go to funding the new national children's hospital.  With regard to approaches by the Camelot group, I have not been approached by that company.  It is wrong to bring these people in.  We have a register of lobbyists now and we should implement it with regard to people who come to the Oireachtas.  As was said by Senator Hayden, there should be a distinction between charities and groups such as Camelot coming to the House.  Such people coming here to lobby for their own gain should be discouraged.<\/p><p>Senator O'Neill spoke about farming and the lack of quality forage.  He asked that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine apply for access to the hardship and solidarity funds.  I am sure the Minister will make every effort in that regard.  He will be in the House after Easter to discuss Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform, labelling and the horsemeat situation, all of which are items Members have asked that the Minister come to the House to discuss.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised the Construction Contracts Bill.  I assure him that as soon as it returns from the D\u00e1il we will deal with it immediately.  There will be no delay in this House on that very important legislation.  I acknowledge the long delays that have occurred since we first dealt with the Bill.  The Senator also spoke about organ donations and new developments in that area.  I will find out from the Minister what the position is with regard to introducing legislation to deal with that matter.<\/p><p>Senators Whelan, Wilson and others raised the property tax.  The property tax is being introduced to help fix the massive deficit in funds.  It is being introduced as it is six times more job friendly than taxes on labour, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  The Government fully agrees that households in unfinished developments that are in a seriously problematic condition should be exempt from payment of the local property tax.  However, there has been a general misunderstanding of some of the facts surrounding the local property tax waivers.  They have been unfairly compared with the household charge waiver, which people claim benefited 43,000 households.  In fact, 20,000 of these houses were neither complete nor occupied, so the waiver benefited nobody in those circumstances.  In light of more accurate information, this anomaly has now been removed.<\/p><p>The regulations signed by the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, last week to prescribe estates that qualify for an exemption from local property tax are based on the 2012 national housing development survey, which was carried out over the course of the summer of 2012.  That survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  It expressly included estates that were deemed by local authorities to be in seriously problematic condition.  This definition includes estates that have outstanding development issues in many areas.  With regard to the differences between the local property tax and the household charge waivers, the experience of dealing with unfinished estates presented a need to redefine the criteria used, in particular a need to distinguish between housing within estates.  Many estates are built in phases and serious issues might only apply to a small proportion of houses that were generally built or begun in the later phases.  That clarifies the matter in respect of the household survey.  The files have been updated.  The original number of 43,000 waivers was quoted in the newspapers, but the actual number was 20,000.  That is the situation.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane raised the issues of mental health funding.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was in the House and stated that the funding for mental health is ring-fenced.<\/p> <p>Moneys that were not spent last year will also be part of the additional funding for mental health services this year.<\/p><p>Senator Noone referred to the interesting concept of the levy on multiples that is now in place in Northern Ireland and the prospect of reducing rates for smaller businesses.  I am sure the relevant Minister will certainly consider the position in this regard.<\/p><p>On the point raised by Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, we all realise that people are experiencing grave difficulties and there is no question that they are finding it very hard to make ends meet.  Fianna F\u00e1il signed up to the property tax, however, and if it were in power, such a tax would have been in place since last year.  Fianna F\u00e1il seems to have undergone a Pauline conversion in respect of the property tax.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the cost of drugs and variations in price between pharmacies.  According to the survey the Senator mentioned, it would appear that some pharmacies are not passing on the benefits of lower prices and reduced mark-ups to patients and customers.  This is very disappointing.  The public awareness to which the National Consumer Agency price comparison survey gives rise in respect of this matter is welcome.  The Minister for Health is raising the issue of price transparency with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, the regulatory body for pharmacists in this country.  While it would not be possible to display the prices of the approximately 7,000 medicines currently on the market here, the PSI has been asked to examine how greater price transparency can be achieved.  The latter should happen and the price of a particular medicine in one part of the country should not be double that which is charged elsewhere.<\/p><p>Senator Harte referred RTE.  I am not aware that coverage of this evening's match by the station will in some way be blocked from being broadcast in Northern Ireland.

Last week, we debated the Finance Bill at length.  I agree that reforms are necessary and that regulatory impact assessments should be available when we dealing with such legislation in the future.  Senator Conway also referred to this matter in the context of discussing submissions in advance of the budget.  Such discussions took place to a degree last year and I hope we will continue in this vein in the coming year.  As Senators are aware, the budget is due to be introduced in October.  This is earlier than in previous years.<\/p><p>Senator Gilroy referred to a matter of which I was not aware with regard to outdoor staff employed by Cork County Council and indicated that the sanctions imposed are too harsh and are the result of an over-reliance on red tape and an over-abundance of health and safety regulations.

I tabled the issue for debate because parents' representatives have raised with me the concern that while everybody else on the board will be there for the full five-year term, one could have parents on the board chopping and changing, and this could put them at a disadvantage <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i> other members of the board.  I can see the logic behind the amendment in that, if a parent came on the board when his or child was in secondary school and the child was not involved for the following four years, the parent would not be an appropriate representative for those four years.  I want to raise, however, that concern that has been brought to me about consistency of representation.  That is the substance of amendments Nos. 2 and 8.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 5 is about ensuring parents' representatives are &quot;chosen through a ballot of local parents&quot;.  It is important to have the national parents' bodies involved in the election process.  They have an important role to play in terms of support for parents and training.  Although the Bill is mainly about the post-primary sector, both the Minister and I attended the annual general meeting of the National Parents Council Primary last year.  It is doing fantastic work, supported by the Department, in providing training for parents' representatives on boards of management.  More of that needs to be done at second level as well.  That is a good idea.  Ultimately, the parents' representatives on the ETBs should be chosen by local parents and every parent with a child in any of the educational facilities covered in his or her area should have an opportunity to vote for his or her representative.  That is important in terms of ownership of the process by local parents.

I have no difficulty with it but how to get something that will practically work.  I want to talk about a person who is a member of a local authority who subsequently becomes a member of the new ETB but which is currently a VEC.  Under the proposed legislation if a member of a local authority subsequently loses his or her seat for whatever reason - since we are aligning the elections with local elections this will not necessarily happen - or if he or she ceases to be a member of a local authority for legal reasons with which one would be familiar, he or she will automatically lose a seat.  In addition in this context, we must provide for every possibility in legislation and not just for probable ones.  If the same principle is applied to parents then there must be an institutional linkage between their membership of the ETB through being the parent of a child in the education system or through being a member of the local authority at that time.<\/p><p>I with to turn to the role of the National Parents Council.  We know what is going to happen and I offer the following for consideration but we can return to it on Report Stage if Senators want to give it consideration.  We know that the new elections in June 2014 will bring the new composition into place and we shall simply bring the three or two existing VECs together as a transitional process.  The National Parents Council could initiate an invitation or expressions of interest.  For example, in the Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim configuration that is simply the way.  Senator Mooney should feel comfortable that Leitrim is recognised and  I know how Leitrim feels neglected by the rest of the world.  One could invite expressions of interest from people in those three counties.  They could be asked if they want to be considered for election or nomination to the board.  We could have some way of doing that so it is not going to be a surprise.  In my view, logistically and practically, one could not start to engage in that exercise after local elections and there should be some preparations made for it.  I am open to considerations on Report Stage because we have done something similar regarding representations in the five areas where business and learners will be represented.  A mechanism exists and if we can align it in some way with that I will be open to giving it consideration on Report Stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600022#Y00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1364314500,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Minister has referred to the configuration of which we are part.  It is the one anomaly in the legislation and I ask my colleagues to consider Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo together as a geographical entity.  On the basis of the current legislation the appointment by the national board could end up with a parent in Westport being nominated as one of the parents' representatives and he or she would then have to consider how to adequately represent the interests of the parents and pupils of Carrigallen Vocational School which is on the Cavan-Leitrim border, half a country away.  Is easier to reach Dublin as it is nearer in terms of location.<\/p><p>I wish to record my appreciation of the Minister's willingness to debate these intricate issues, particularly those related to counties Leitrim and Sligo.  With the exception of the Dublin City and Cork City County, it is the only configuration that involves three local authority areas.  It is not just about the numbers but the sheer geographical entity that has now been created that will create enormous difficulties.  Let me outline one example.  Senator Power tabled an amendment that sought a local ballot.  Such a provision would go some but not the whole way towards addressing the issue.  I have argued that there should be, in the case of this configuration, at least a minimum of one parents representative from each of the counties.  That would ensure that the scenario I have outlined would not happen as there would be one parents' representative each for Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo.<\/p> <p>I do not think there will be a major difficulty in the other counties.  For example, Cavan and Monaghan will probably work it out so that they will get one representative for each county on that basis.  <\/p><p>I sat on the national council and am somewhat unique in this country in that I was directly elected as a parents' representative on my own VEC.

I am just attempting to square the circle and do not want to over egg the pudding.  The Minister has said he would consider suggestions and proposals on Report Stage, so does he see a possibility of addressing that issue?  I appreciate it is a difficult one but he has addressed it in a previous section in terms of local authority representation.  Without singling out Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo, he has said that where there is a configuration of three there will be a minimum of three local authority representatives.<\/p><p>I must put on the record that this is an extraordinarily big advance on what the original legislation was proposing, which would have ended up - on the basis of the math, as the Americans put it - with Leitrim having only one local authority representative.  I am grateful to the Minister who saw the merit of that argument in terms of equity and fairness.  Everybody accepts that and the same applies where there are two.  All of that is contained in the relevant section.  Will the Minister consider this matter because the way it will work, as currently outlined in this legislation, is not an ideal scenario.<\/p><p>During my time on the national council there were a number of counties that did not have any parents' representatives on their VECs.  For some unknown, bizarre reason some counties did not nominate representatives and no elections were held.  I would be concerned that, if the nomination process is left with the national council, the Minister may not necessarily get the result he is seeking in terms of the people appointed.  If some counties showed a lack of interest, the person appointed may fulfil the criteria but may not otherwise be suitable.  <\/p><p>I know the Minister is a strong democrat, so I am inclined towards the argument that Senator Power has made about local ballots.  One can see the difficulty there would be, particularly in Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo, in coming up with a formula that would give fairness and equity, as well as providing local representation in the various counties.  The only solution I can see is to adopt a position similar to that which the Minister adopted with the local authority representation, that is, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage that would address a minimum level of representation where there are two or three counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600023#Z00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1364314800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to look at each of our amendments before Report Stage.

A local ballot is important but we need to look at the best way of doing that, which fits in with the timescale involved.

There are panels for election to this Chamber to which I was once elected.  To follow up on what the Leas-Chathaoirleach has explained, there is only one unique three county combination.  There are three local authorities in other combinations but I refer to Limerick city and Limerick county.  Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo are unique in that sense and we will have to find a way to overcome that.  In anticipation of the local elections and the formation of the new education and training boards, ETBs, one could invite expressions of interest from parents who qualify, that is, who have a young person or persons in school in any one of the three counties now made up into an education and training board.  The expressions of interest could be confined to a certain number.  I will not prescribe what it will be.  One could then sign off on it and certify through a statutory instrument that 12 or 15 names from the National Parents Council, NPC, nominees for ETB No. 1, 2 or 3, to stick with the example we are looking at, would be chosen, allowing for gender balance.  It would then be up to the elected councillors to decide who they would be.  That is what we are doing with the five additional ones.

The parent representatives could only come from that panel by virtue of being elected.  The 12 county councillors from the local authority are elected.  The staff representative would be appointed from within the democratic process within the new ETB and perhaps \u2013 I am thinking on my feet without prescribing a direct model \u2013 those 12 plus two would be required to elect from a selected panel of parent representatives who meet the criteria.

At least two learner representatives are required to provide for proper representation across the sector.

I assure the Senator that parents will have a strong interest in this matter.  I understand her point about appointing representatives of learners in their own right.  To ensure flexibility, we adopted an approach of having the principle enunciated in primary legislation, while using a statutory instrument for the purposes of nominating the bodies that will represent learners.  These include the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and AONTAS.  Given that a new body may emerge in the next ten or 15 years, it would not be appropriate or constitute good use of parliamentary time to return to the House and change primary legislation to include the name of the new body in the Act.  By extension, my proposal in respect of business is similar.  A knowledge of business or enterprise is a requirement for nominees and bodies such as IBEC, ISME and local chambers of commerce would be invited to nominate people resident in the relevant area, with the final decision resting with the council.  This system would be not unlike the system in place for the Seanad in that nominees would have to come through a panel system.  <\/p><p>There is no equivalent of the Union of Students of Ireland for adult learners.  The representative bodies which perform a role in respect of adult learners that is similar to the role of the USI are NALA and AONTAS.  My concern is that if I increase the number of representatives of learners from one to two, the number of board members will increase from 21 to 22.  Someone from NALA or AONTAS who comes through a nominating process will be indirectly accountable.  NALA would not be in a position to nominate one person to fill the slot - Senator Wilson raised this issue - but would have to nominate at least two people, at least one of whom would be female.  It would then be for the incomplete council, albeit one with a democratic mandate given that it would consist of local councillors, to make the selection.<\/p> <p>We are trying to reconcile representation on the one hand with democratic legitimacy on the other and this is what we have come up with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600026#CC00300","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364316000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I can see that the Minister is reluctant to increase the membership further, given that we have already increased the number of councillors since the first draft.

I take the Minister's point that we have gone from 18 to 21 already and he was prepared to make space to address other points raised.  I also accept the Minister's argument as to why he has not opted to name specific bodies in the legislation.  I met representatives of NALA at an earlier stage in this process about the Bill and we discussed the need for that organisation to be a nominating body.  However, I take the Minister's point that it is not appropriate that every time one wants to add a new body, one is required to change primary legislation.  I accept that this is probably best done by way of ministerial regulation and I appreciate the Minister's assurance that NALA is one of the nominating bodies.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that there is not a USI-type arrangement in place and that student representative structures in general are not great not just in the VECs, but in adult education generally.  That is a result of a much higher turnover of students, with many doing one-year courses and so forth, unlike the four-year degree structure at many universities, which enabled myself and Senator Bacik to become involved in student representation, for example.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue further before Report Stage.  I believe the principle is important, while accepting what the Minister has said about parents.  However, from the teenage years onwards, while it is important for parents to have a voice, I also believe that young adults should have a greater say on issues that affect them, as does the Minister himself.  I would like to see this matter considered again between now and Report Stage to see if we can arrive at something that is acceptable to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600027#DD00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1364316000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Power's amendment because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the matter.

I do not know if there is a problem about 22 members as opposed to 21 - that does not seem to make a significant difference, other than the fact that it becomes an even number, which could pose problems.  Having said that, the original 18 was also an even number, so perhaps it is not an issue at all.

The existing system has given rise to practical difficulties, particularly where a number of bodies come together to elect people to one board.  Difficulties at local level have arisen, particularly when a casual vacancy occurs and doubts have been created about the validity of actions of boards that do not reflect the correct gender proportions.  In the course of this debate, my concerns on this issue have been ones of practicality and not ones of principle.<\/p><p>On Committee Stage in the other House, I said that I personally favoured the introduction of gender quotas in some form for local elections.  Having reflected on the arguments articulated by Senator Bacik on Second Stage and by others on previous points in this conversation, I now propose amendment No. 4.  The effect of the amendment will be to compel the Minister of the day to make regulations - statutory instruments - governing the election of local authority members to ETBs.  Those regulations may provide for gender balance by creating separate panels for men and women.  They will also empower the Minister as far as possible to specify a minimum number of women and men who must be elected by each local authority.  The amendment provides that in making the regulations the Minister must have regard to the objective of at least 40% of each gender being elected by the local authorities.  This reflects Government policy on gender balance on State boards and I believe it may attract cross-party support also, but that remains to be seen.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that as a society we have further work to do to ensure proper representation of women at all levels in the public and private sectors.

When I read through the Bill, it was clear that it had carefully provided for gender quotas in other aspects of the election, but there was a glaring gap in respect of local authority elections.

I had actually considered proposing the same wording but decided against it.<\/p><p>During the Seanad election campaign I visited some counties where there were only one or two female councillors on a local authority.  This made it difficult to draft an amendment that would make sense.

I would not like to do that to a member who might not want to participate, which would be the logical conclusion of the other wording.  That was why I did not table such an amendment.  The sensible approach is to say that the Minister would wish to have proper gender representation and that he can provide for it through regulations at another stage.<\/p><p>The legislation we agreed last year to introduce gender quotas for general elections was incredibly progressive, on which I commend the Government.

That is a good way of doing it and mirrors what has been done for the other panels.  However, it is unduly conservatively worded with the use of the word \"may\" in the new subsection (5) which states: \"The Minister shall make regulations for the conduct of elections for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) and the regulations may provide -\".  I suggest that it should state: \"...and the regulations shall provide\".  That would be a belt and braces way of ensuring that this would be done.  There are enough provisos later to ensure that the Minister and the local authorities are not unduly bound.  The new paragraph (b) provides \"that, as far as practicable, a minimum number of women and a minimum number of men shall be elected from each authority\".  That is one proviso, while subsection (6) provides that the Minister shall have regard to the objectives.  Those are much less prescriptively worded.  There should, however, be prescriptive language used in terms of the regulations being made.  That is my one reservation about the amendment and I would be delighted if it could be amended again on Report Stage.<\/p><p>Senator Moran and I are happy to withdraw our amendment on the basis that the Minister's amendment replaces it and seeks to fulfil the same function.  I made these comments on Second Stage and pointed to the need for an amendment to ensure there is a gender balance in the local authority membership of the education and training boards.  I am delighted the Minister accepted that in principle and, as he said, it was really a matter of practicality that it was not included.<\/p><p>I must express my gratitude to the current councillor and former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, who first raised this with me.  As Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach had ensured that the previous VEC legislation provided for gender balance in the local authority membership of the VECs and she was very anxious to see that principle enshrined in the education and training boards legislation.  I am delighted that it will now be so enshrined.  However, we might strengthen the wording somewhat by changing that single word in amendment No. 4.  I am very grateful that the Minister has accepted this in principle.  The Bill is strengthened as a result and there will be better representation of men and women.<\/p><p>Finally, like Senator Power, I would like to have seen perhaps strengthened legislation in terms of local authority membership and quotas for political parties, but I believe the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act will make a huge difference in the next general election and in the next local elections because parties will have to bring forward women candidates.  There is a very poor level of representation at local level, at approximately 16%, while the level in the D\u00e1il is 15%.

Notwithstanding the import of the Government amendment and what the Minister is attempting to do, which I fully support, has any thought been given to how this might pan out on the ground?  Sadly, as has been said by Senator Power, there is a severe under-representation of women in some local authorities.  Let us be politically practical about this.  The dominant party or grouping that is in power shares out the spoils.  I wish there was more power sharing at local level, and in some instances there is, but there generally is not, to be blunt.  It is still winner takes all.  I do not ascribe that to any single party, it is just the reality.  Some will say that this is democracy and I may get used to it, but it is not really.<\/p><p>If the dominant group or party in a local authority has an under-representation of women, this provision forces the woman into a situation where the party will say she must sit on the board in order to comply with the legislation.  The woman might say she does not want to sit on the board but the party will tell her that she must.  There is no flexibility in this at all.  Once this Bill is enacted into law, local authorities will have no choice.  They will have to implement it.  There will be no give or take, no transition period and no flexibility.

To take the scenario the Senator mentioned, if the female member of whatever caucus simply refused for a variety of reasons, there would be other females available from, perhaps, a different caucus who would get it.  Practice varies in different local authorities.  In some cases, the practice is winner takes all for whoever happens to be the dominant group.  In others, there is a <i>pro rata<\/i> sharing.  In my local council, Dublin City Council, there was a <i>pro rata<\/i> distribution of members in different seats.  Perhaps that is the way to go, through local government reform, to provide for proportionality in the different sub-committees of the local authority.  However, if it is the case that a group that is predominantly male is hoping to control the ETB and if it wishes to maximise its strength, it will have to incorporate females in that grouping.  Politicians act rationally when it comes to matters such as this.  If we make it a prerequisite that it must be a mixed team in terms of gender balance, it is up to the common sense of the political leadership, rather than forcing one person to do it who, for all sorts of reasons, might simply say that she does not wish to do it.<\/p><p>  With regard to Senator Bacik's request to change the wording of &quot;the regulations may provide&quot; in section 5, I am open to changing the word to &quot;shall&quot;.

On Second Stage I referred to the fact that among the 21 members there will only be two teachers and one learner.  We want people with direct classroom experience.  When the Minister or his successors are making their five ministerial appointments, provision should be made in this regard.  There is a certain degree of demoralisation in the sector with regard to the fact that so many people outside it believe they can do the job better than a teacher in the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600030#GG01300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1364317800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Until they try it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600030#GG01400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1364317800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>As I also stated on Second Stage, the Minister will probably obtain a sense of the demoralisation to which I refer when he attends the teachers' conferences.<\/p><p>At present, mathematics teachers are putting in a huge effort to overcome a national problem.  They might not be represented by an established body in the way that those who occupy management and leadership roles are.  Teachers throughout the country are doing the best they can to deal with the problem relating to mathematics to which I refer.  In the past, history teachers formed an organisation, the aim of which was to desectarianise the teaching of history.  Before that, there was great enthusiasm for the teaching of Irish on the part of those who volunteered in that capacity.  It would be useful to have people with that type of interest - as opposed to an occupational interest - in teaching involved.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Power's point that another learner should be included in the five members to be appointed by the Minister.  There must be at least three or four people present who will inform the other members as to what it is like to teach in a classroom.  Two learners, two teachers and people who have the enthusiasm to mount campaigns and encourage interest in national programmes - the one currently in train is that which relates to project maths - should be involved.  The Minister should consider such individuals when making his appointments in order to ensure that there will be some form of direct involvement from the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032600030#GG01500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1364317800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I was not present for the debate on Second State, so I wish to elaborate on a couple of matters now.  I am concerned to have legislation which will be fit for purpose in 20 or 30 years' time.  The reality is that we have a public private partnership in education.  The public side is the State, which sets the curriculum, pays salaries, regulates the examination process, etc.  At primary level we have different patrons and at secondary level we have VEC schools, as they currently are, and the free voluntary sector and in between are the community schools.  For reasons of history and social change and given the strength of private sector partners at both primary and secondary level and the decrease in numbers - this is not in any way a partisan religious comment and I do not want it to be taken as such - I am of the view that the ETBs will be able to deliver to educational providers, on a non-compulsory basis, certain services.  For example, if a principal of a school sought to have something done under the summer works scheme, subject to the agreement of the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA - the dominant patron - half a dozen contracts for small works projects in the relevant area could be carried out under the supervision of the ETB.  This would free up the principal in question, who would not be a project manager or building contractor in the first instance.  Human resources and IT support and a host of other supports could be provided at the request of the school in question.  This would happen at primary level and in the free voluntary sector.  By definition, the VEC schools will have access to the services to which I refer.<\/p><p>I must inform Senator Barrett that if I, through a statutory instrument, were to make a specification in respect of the provision in section 30(9) whereby one of the bodies to be appointed &quot;shall be a body established for the purpose of representing the interests of persons engaged in the management of, or leadership in, recognised schools&quot; in the next two to three months, the CPSMA, the joint management body, JMB - which crosses both religious denominations - Educate Together and the various other stakeholders would be invited to nominate people for consideration in order that they might be represented.  Education providers at primary and secondary level have informed me that they are nervous about a traditional VEC body which would be a provider of education in the broader sense and which would also have a stake in its own schools.  They are of the view that there is a possible conflict there.  If we want to have better co-operation between the free voluntary sector and the VEC schools, as they currently are, then the stakeholders involved should have a voice on the education and training boards.<\/p><p>This will be for future Ministers for Education and Skills and Governments to decide but I am of the view that we will need a much stronger local education partner to operate with the Department of Education and Skills at central level.  There are things which we simply cannot do at national level that VECs or their successor bodies could do.  However, they will not be able to do these things unless the educational stakeholders are of the view that they have a role to play at the heart of the ETBs, namely, on their boards.  That is the thinking behind the relevant provision.  The principle in enunciated in the primary legislation and the bodes to which I have just referred are those I have in mind in order that we might give effect to what is envisaged in the next year or so.  Names will be put forward by the nominating bodies and, ultimately, it will be the responsibility of the boards of the  ETBs to select who they wish to fill the relevant posts.  They will not merely be able to appoint a friend of a friend of a friend to positions.<\/p> <p>We all know that it happened, irrespective of which group was dominant.  It is to have a two-tiered system.<\/p><p>Based on precedent, many of the 12 local authority members are teachers, for example, principals or subject teachers in second level schools.  They are not present in an institutional capacity, but they are a strong component in every elected assembly across Europe for all sorts of reasons.  The teaching voice is not silenced because it does not have a formal representative.

Some of those contracts will expire in July and others in December, because some doctors did not begin working until January 2012.

This process was aimed at addressing shortages due to arise with the changeover of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in July 2011.<\/p><p>The key requirement for doctors to begin employment with the HSE is registration with the Medical Council. Urgent amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act were enacted in 2011 to create a new supervised division of the register. This provided a safe, effective registration process for a two year period for doctors recruited from abroad.<\/p><p>This recruitment process and the introduction of the supervised division resulted in almost 290 doctors working in the Irish health service for the first time.  Candidates were fully informed of the conditions of recruitment.  For most candidates, the two year period in the supervised division is coming to an end.  The only option open to doctors wishing to continue employment in Ireland is to apply to either the general or trainee specialist divisions.  The choice of division will depend on individual qualifications and experience.<\/p><p>Doctors in the supervised division only practise medicine in the post to which they have been proposed and under strict supervisory arrangements.  Registration in the general division involves clinical assessments to ensure the practitioner is fit to practise in a range of positions.  Transferring from the supervised division involves undergoing the pre-registration examination system, PRES, which is designed to ensure doctors demonstrate competence in a general scope of practice.  This is a critical measure to protect the public.<\/p><p>The NCHDs may also seek registration in the trainee specialist division provided relevant criteria are met.  These include access to a recognised training post, holding a document which is equivalent to a certificate of experience, and being successful at the PRES unless exemption criteria pertain.<\/p><p>The HSE contacted doctors in relation to the process for transfer in November 2012.  This process was also outlined to representatives of this cohort at a meeting on 8 March by the Department of Health, the HSE and the Medical Council.  The Medical Council has received and processed applications for some doctors. The remaining doctors have not yet provided necessary documents and information to the council to progress their applications.  Doctors who have received final communication from the Medical Council regarding outstanding documents and information have until 2 April to do so.<\/p><p>For doctors not wishing to remain within the Irish health sector, the HSE has confirmed that the president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan indicated his willingness to discuss with them the possibility of returning to jobs in Pakistan, recognising their time spent in Ireland.  The HSE will assist those who wish to explore this option.  For doctors returning to India, the HSE will also assist by providing references and further information on the time spent here in Ireland.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the important contribution to the Irish health care system made by these doctors over the past two years.<\/p> <p>While every effort will continue to be made to facilitate movement to the general division in a timely manner, the HSE must have sufficient NCHD cover in July in our hospitals.
