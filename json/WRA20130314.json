The EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy forms an integral part of the Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the area of Common Security and Defence Policy, the role of the Presidency is now limited to supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard.  However, that said, this arrangement provides Ireland with an opportunity to influence the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda.    As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council 2013, I prioritised a number of areas including enhancing EU\/UN Relations, in particular, through EU engagement and participation in UN Peacekeeping.  I hosted a very successful and well attended seminar in Dublin Castle on this subject.  Speakers from the EU, NATO, the UN and, for the first time, the African Union as well academia gave informative presentations to over 120 delegates who attended from all over Europe.<\/p><p>  This seminar informed the follow up discussion at the Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers who recognised the primacy of the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security and the requirement for the EU to work hand in hand with the UN.  The attendance at the Informal meeting of EU Ministers for Defence including, for the first time the UN represented by the Under Secretary General at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations also has cemented this priority into the thinking of the EU. At the Informal meeting a number of follow-up work strands were identified and these will be progressed with the European External Action Service.<\/p><p>  In summary, this priority has and will continue to provide impetus to the Union as a whole to the enhancement of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, a critical component of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, and to the United Nations which is central to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy objectives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400047#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400047#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[13150\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400047#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of medical staff within the Defence Forces; the number who have a psychiatric qualification; the number in each category serving in a medical role here and overseas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The Military Authorities have advised me that the number of medical staff within the Defence Forces is 217, comprising 17 Medical Officers, 5 Line Officers, 4 Dentists, 3 Pharmacists and 1 Clinical Psychologist and the remaining 187 being of other ranks.

The members of the EU Battlegroup were Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Macedonia.   For each of these battlegroups Ireland&rsquo;s participation was minimal and amounted to staff posts at the Operational and\/or Force Headquarters.

No military equipment has been purchased specifically for EU Battlegroups. Training of the manoeuvre elements of the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in the contributing Member States - Irish troops were trained in Ireland. Unlike the Nordic Battlegroup, there were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.

These include the continued development of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the comprehensive approach to crisis management.   Regarding the Comprehensive approach to crisis management the priority is to ensure that all tools, e.g., Diplomatic, military political, economic etc., at the disposal of the European Union are utilised to ensure that any crises occurring are managed in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way. An example of this is the work currently being undertaken in the Horn of Africa whereby there are a number of military operations and a number of civilian missions operating side by side. These include, the military operation EUNAVFOR, which deters, prevents and represses acts of piracy and armed robbery and protects vessels of the World Food Programme (WFP), humanitarian aid and African Union Mission on Somalia (AMISOM) shipping and EUCAP Nestor, which is supporting regional maritime capacity building in the Horn of Africa and Western Indian Ocean states. <\/p><p>  I am of the view that developing a comprehensive approach to tackling security issues, self-evidently serves a common good. Establishing closer co-ordination between the EU and international institutions and actors primarily dealing with all aspects of internal and external security is essential. <\/p><p>  Within the EU there is a broad consensus that the approach to any crisis must be all-encompassing to ensure that countries and\/or regions that are unstable, subject to conflict or are fragile receive the required assistance.<\/p><p>  To achieve this, I am seeking to ensure that any approach being adopted, like that in Mali, emphasises the full cycle of engagement from prevention to mediation, to crisis management and post-conflict assistance.<\/p><p>  As such co-operation with international organisations must always be prioritised and there is a need for the EU to allow such organisations operate within their mandate.

The SLA provides that a full evaluation of the EAS service is to be undertaken by the stakeholders three months prior to the end of the pilot and this process is now underway. <\/p><p>  There are no plans to expand the role of the Air Corps in the provision of these Air Ambulance services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[13154\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost of security at each of the closed army bases per month since their closure; the total amount of moneys paid to each private security company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence has at present security arrangements in place at two former military installations &ndash; Columb Barracks Mullingar and Rockhill House Letterkenny.

To this end, I will host a Seminar titled &ldquo;Challenges and Opportunities in Maritime Security and Surveillance for Effective Governance and Innovation in the EU&rsquo;s Maritime Domain&rdquo; in April. This seminar will act as a forum to highlight the importance of building EU wide consensus and cooperation in relation to security and surveillance in the maritime domain in support of EU Sea Basins Strategies (including the new EU Atlantic Strategy), the Integrated Maritime Policy, the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) and Common Security and Defence Policy in the maritime domain.  In meeting the challenges of the 21st century, the unique aspects of the Union&rsquo;s maritime and surveillance domain will be highlighted. The seminar will seek to draw lessons from existing EU Sea Basin strategies and the technologies and operational procedures which support collaboration among member States, with a particular focus on EU Navies.     The seminar will also raise awareness of the role maritime surveillance and security can play as an economic enabler thus contributing to the EU Jobs, Growth and Innovation strategy. A wide range of high level speakers will attend and present their perspectives on this important topic.  <\/p><p>  An important regional element of the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Integrated Maritime Policy (2007) is the development of sea-basin strategies, taking into account the regional specificities of maritime policy for the various Member States.  In this context, the European Commission approved the adoption of an Atlantic Strategy.  The Atlantic Strategy, will take stock of existing initiatives that can support growth and job creation.  The strategy will cover the coasts, territorial and jurisdictional waters of the five EU Member States with an Atlantic coastline &ndash; France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.  Preliminary meetings between these five Member States have taken place and work is ongoing regarding the development of this strategy, in which Ireland is playing a key role.   <\/p><p>  In furtherance of developments in this area, the European Defence Agency is coordinating a project involving 13 Member States, including Ireland.  This project &ldquo;MARSUR&rdquo; will allow for the sharing of maritime information among participating member States Naval Forces. The Irish Naval Service participates in this project.  In concert, the Commission&rsquo;s initiative &ndash; the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) - will allow for the exchange of information across all EU maritime sectors, through the integration of existing maritime systems with the use of modern technologies, in a cost efficient and effective manner.  &ldquo;MARSUR&rdquo; will ultimately feed into this system. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in this project will enhance information sharing and knowledge transfer between Member States and build working relationships based on &ldquo;mutual trust&rdquo; with other European agencies at the operational level.  As we have seen, by our involvement in drug seizures, success depends on the cooperation of our national and international partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[13156\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he has tasked anyone within his Department to examine the policy on reserve Defence Forces in Nordic states who contribute skilled soldiers on their peacekeeping missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>I am aware that other countries, including Nordic countries, deploy members of their Reserve Forces on overseas peace support operations.

The &ldquo;Keane Report&rdquo; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered in order to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.  While the Government accepts that, in a functioning market, it is necessary to have a repossession system with appropriate safeguards for both debtors and creditors, the Government, as indeed also did the Secretary General before the PAC, has clearly indicated that repossession is only an option of last resort.

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.<\/p><p>  The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.<\/p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.<\/p><p>  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.

While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an amendment as requested by the Deputy, if passed, would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.  In addition, it would inevitably lead to self-diagnosis of ailments which could have dire consequences for patients where their own diagnosis proves incorrect and they have embarked on the wrong treatment in the absence of the correct medical advice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[13451\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013031400048#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has considered the way to prioritise school building projects that are not on his Department's five year capital programme in the event of additional funding being made available or if scheduled projects are delayed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, my priority is to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected pupil enrolment increases into the future.

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements, which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;. RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act. The extent to which the commitments entered into by our two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).   <\/p><p>  Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body.  Matters in relation to Irish music content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators. In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  <\/i><\/p><p><i>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.<\/i><\/p><p><i>In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/i><\/p><p><i>The position in relation to the immigration status of Long Term Residency is that, at the date of application, a person applying for such status must have been legally resident in the State for over five years (60 months) on the basis of work permit, work authorisation or working visa conditions and, as such, must have Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements on their Passport during such periods.

Following the deployment of a contingent of some 170 personnel of the Armed forces of Finland to UNIFIL, a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion was formed in May 2012.

Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. <\/p><p><br \/>  The primary focus of military training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training, designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force and is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of any changes in the threat assessment or mission requirements. <\/p><p><br \/>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and I am advised that Defence Forces personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available, on a par with the best international practice and requirements, for training purposes and to carry out their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The acquisition of new equipment, including equipment used for training, for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence. However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. <\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the Naval Service, a strategy for the replacement of Naval Service Offshore Patrol Vessels is currently in train. A contract was signed in October, 2010 with Babcock Marine in the United Kingdom for the provision of two new offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV&#8217;s). The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level and that the most up to date equipment, including modern technology and IT equipment, is available to Naval Service personnel.Preparations for the construction of the ships have commenced in Appledore, UK and the build of the first ship is well advanced. The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second ship will follow one year later.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the issue of Naval Service training, I am satisfied that Naval Services training techniques and the technologies involved are up to date in all respects. A considerable training effort is also involved with the new ships programme to allow for a smooth entry of the two ships into operational service in 2014 and 2015.<\/p><p>The Air Corps keeps abreast of all developments in modern aviation.
