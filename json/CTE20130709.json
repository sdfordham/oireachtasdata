However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are further asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The Minister might note that is a formality we are obliged to go through.<\/p><p>  I propose to allow the Minister make an opening statement following which I will call the spokespersons in the normal fashion.  Given the importance and complexity of the recent CAP negotiations, there is no doubt that will form part of our exchange today.  The other issues we have identified are tackling rural poverty and social isolation, animal welfare and animal disease, pricing of milk, food security in light of the recent fodder crisis, and inshore fishing.  The Minister may wish to raise other matters.  I invite the Minister, Ms O'Neill MLA, to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900003#B00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373374800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the members today.  Our Assembly went into recess yesterday but I did not have enough of it and I thought I would come down here today to talk to the members.  I am happy to pick up on the points the Chairman mentioned and take questions from members.<\/p><p>  A good place to start would be Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I congratulate the Southern Government on its successful Presidency in the past six months.  From my perspective, I worked closely with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in that time.  He had a very difficult task in trying to get agreement on CAP reform across all the member states and we are delighted that we were able to reach that agreement some weeks ago. It is fair to say that some of the proposals the Commission put on the table initially alarmed the farming industry but the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Southern Government can take pride in the fact that we have come a long way from those opening proposals.  Some of the key achievements in the discussions have been broadly welcomed by industry, particularly the green proposals which are now better suited to our grassland regions, and also that we have the flexibility to adapt policies to suit our own industry in the future.<\/p><p>  While the work in Brussels in the past 18 months was very difficult, the big decisions will be taken when we consult across the island on how we take the process forward and, now that we have that flexibility, the best way to use it to suit the local industry.  The time ahead will be challenging and I want to make sure that we work together because there is a great deal of scope for North-South liaison on the policy and implementation issues in the time ahead.<\/p><p>  I am keen to discuss with the committee the tackling poverty and social isolation area of work.  This is Sinn F&eacute;in's second time to hold this Ministry.  Tackling poverty was not really on the Department's agenda but for me it has been very successful.  In her term, Ms Michelle Gildernew MP brought forward a &pound;10 million package and I have been able to bring forward a package of &pound;16 million.  The strategy is about tackling isolation, getting to those hard to reach people, and supporting rural communities to be sustainable into the future.  When we meet people who live in rural communities we hear of their isolation and loneliness.  They feel they have been forgotten by a number of services, and they often fall between two stools.  This strategy aims to better the lives of those people and it was important to me that I was able to reach a successful target in the programme for Government, which brought forward the &pound;16 million package.<\/p><p>  A number of areas of work have moved forward around that initiative, including fuel poverty and youth employability.  We have been able to bring forward a number of schemes that have been very successful.  We have some way to go in that regard but what we have done in changing the direction of the Department and making sure it is focusing on the needs of rural communities has been very successful.<\/p><p>  In terms of animal health, we have the animal health and welfare strategy.  Given that we are a single island in terms of disease control, it is important that we work together across the island.  We have a common purpose and a common interest in eradicating disease and preventing the introduction of disease.  I am pleased, therefore, that good progress continues to be made on cross-Border co-operation on animal health and welfare.  A good deal of constructive work has been done both by officials and at the North-South Ministerial Council level to deliver the welfare strategy and action plan.  It is important that we continue that consistent strategic approach to animal health and welfare policy, which is of significant mutual benefit for all of us across the island.<\/p><p>  I am sure members are aware that the Commission published its new animal health regulation on 6 May under the banner Healthier Animals and Plants for a Safer Agri-Food Chain.  I believe that will be the vehicle that will allow us to look towards free movement across the island.  I look forward to getting into the detail of that and I am sure the committee will have an interest in that area also.<\/p><p>  In terms of disease eradication, we have been working hard in preventing the introduction of disease in the island of Ireland.  My officials continue to work closely with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that all necessary measures are taken and that there is a consistent approach to disease control and eradication.  It is vital that we have comparable powers to deal with new diseases that may reach our shores.  We had a simulation of a disease emergency situation pilot this week that was run across England, Scotland, Wales and the North in which officials from the South got involved also.  That is important in terms of testing what we have in place.  It is all well and good having something that looks good on paper but until it is tested we do not know its effectiveness.  That is positive work and it gives me confidence that we will be able to react quickly and positively to any future outbreak of disease.  It also allows us adopt the fortress Ireland approach that has proved to be very useful in the past, particularly in terms of diseases such as bluetongue and foot and mouth.  I want to see more of those exercises take place in the future.<\/p><p>  I am pleased with the progress we have made towards the eradication of brucellosis.  It could be achieved by us by 2014 provided there is no reversal in the downward trend.  We are moving in the right direction.  We hope to have officially brucellosis-free status by 2015, which would facilitate a reduction in the testing regime resulting in a saving of approximately &pound;7 million to the industry.  That would be a great win.  It is something we are working very hard to achieve and ensure we do not relax our efforts to reach that target.<\/p><p>  I remain fully committed to reducing and ultimately eradicating TB in cattle but, as the members are aware, it is a complex disease.  There is no simple solution to it but we have an ongoing positive programme of work.  Given that we had increases in the number of cases of TB over a number of months, I am delighted to say the statistics are going in the opposite direction because in the past five months the levels have fallen every month.  We hope that continues.  We have a rigorous Commission-approved TB eradication programme in place, which is a priority for me.<\/p> <p> Members may have noted that I announced recently our intention to proceed with a test, vaccinate and release, TVR, approach in respect of wildlife intervention research.  The aim of such intervention is to test the effectiveness of the approach on the level of tuberculosis in badgers and in cattle.  Put in its simplest terms, it involves catching badgers and testing them.  Those that are negative will be vaccinated and released, while those that are sick will be dealt with.  As this has not been done anywhere else, we look forward to ensuring this study gets under way and that we get the information we need.  We have chosen two geographical target areas that have high badger-to-cattle ratios and I look forward to bringing forward this work.  As for plant health, just this morning the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and I launched the all-Ireland Chalara fraxinea control strategy.  This work has been ongoing since we have had instances of the aforementioned disease and is a good concrete example of good co-operation.  I worked closely in the past with the former Minister of State, the late Shane McEntee, and I look forward to working with Deputy Tom Hayes in the future as we work towards dealing with all plant health diseases.<\/p><p> The pricing of milk is another issue I am aware the joint committee is keen to discuss.  Our dairy industry makes an important contribution to the agrifood industry in the North and to employment in rural areas.  Consequently, producers must receive a good price both for their hard work and to remain viable, and fairness in the supply chain has been a major issue we have been trying to tackle.  In itself, pricing obviously is a commercial matter and there are limitations to what we can do to help.  Nevertheless, we have been encouraging the industry to focus on improving efficiency and to ensure its product mix reflects the increasing demands of consumers.  This should help to improve returns and I understand that global markets are likely to remain positive for the remainder of this year.  I am also optimistic that our dairy sector has the potential to grow further and to exploit the opportunities arising from the predicted expansion in the world population.  The dairy sector has contributed to the agrifood strategy board's action plan, Going for Growth, and I hope it will grasp these opportunities and that producers will be rewarded with a good price for their quality products.  Going for Growth is a strategy we launched recently in the North that is comparable with the Harvest 2020 strategy.  It considers targets for each sector and looks towards the challenges and the position in which we need to be in the future.  I consider it to be a highly positive piece of work and I will be happy to pick up on that if anyone is interested in discussing it.<\/p><p> Finally, on all-Ireland inshore fishing, we are engaged at present in consultations with stakeholders on a sustainable development strategy for our inshore fisheries.  The strategy highlights the key challenges currently facing the sector and offers recommendations on how, in partnership with central government, it could move forward with the aim of securing a sustainable and profitable inshore sector in the North.  When the consultation period closes on 2 August and responses have been considered, my officials will be happy, where possible, to engage with colleagues to determine what areas of mutual interest could be progressed on a cross-Border basis.  While that is a short and probably too brief run-through some of the issues, I would be happy to discuss them further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373375400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and as there undoubtedly will be comments or questions, we can return to her in a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900004#C00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1373375400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>First, I welcome the Minister.

The first issue relates to inshore fisheries, about which I have two simple questions.  The briefing document members received indicated there is an agreement in place that fishermen from south of the Border can fish within the North's six-mile limit for all species.  The Minister might confirm whether this means mackerel and anything one may find.  Second, is there a limit to the size of the boat involved within the aforementioned six-mile limit or are there requirements in respect of the type of licence those concerned must have from the authorities here?  In other words can someone with a potting licence from down here then fish for non-potting species in the North's waters?  I also seek information regarding drift net or draft net fishing for salmon in rivers in the North.  Is either method permitted in the North and, if so, under what conditions?  Is there a ban in place on drift netting in the North?  It would be useful for members to be apprised of this because they are seeking to ascertain what are the practices in other jurisdictions and the nearest one to us is the North of Ireland.<\/p><p>  On the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, now the Minister has the menu, I would be interested in hearing her thoughts on the various options available to farmers, whether she intends to opt for convergence or a flat rate and whether she intends to place limits on what any single farmer can get.  In general, does she intend to set minimum staffing levels to ensure activity?  In other words, I refer to all the complicated rules in respect of what being an active farmer might mean.  A particular issue in this regard relates to farmers on commonage.  As the new CAP requires that all farmers are active on all of their land, has thought been given or have discussions taken place on how that might operate in respect of commonage?  In many cases, people were claiming for all their land but were not farming the commonage as they were leaving it to someone else in an arrangement that suited both sides.  Consequently, do the two jurisdictions have a common cause on the entire issue of commonage and the CAP?  I also would be interested in hearing the general approach the Minister is taking to the CAP and the extent to which a CAP policy can be devised in the North of Ireland that would differ from the CAP policy in Britain.  Am I correct in thinking that Northern Ireland is treated as a region or in other words, there is regional policy with regard to the British CAP and the North is treated as a region, as is Scotland?<\/p><p>  Moving on to the milk issue, many farmers in the South are complaining that they are being asked to produce milk for dairies at a price that is not viable.  On examining this issue, the joint committee found there is no question but that farmers are getting a smaller share of the price of milk in the shop than was the case in 1995.  Moreover, on considering the issue in general, one difficulty being faced by the industry appeared to relate to the allegation that some supermarkets were buying milk from the North or from Northern farmers, in that some of it was being processed in the South but originated in the North, and that this milk was coming at a lower price.  When I then asked whether production costs were lower in the North, the answer I seemed to get was not particularly but there had been a very big increase in milk production in the North and people were on a treadmill and were obliged to keep selling.  It was not necessarily that it was very profitable but that what would not be profitable to do down here was profitable in the North.  It appears from the statistics given to the joint committee in respect of liquid milk that the average herd in the North was producing 500,000 l per farmer, which would suggest an average herd size of approximately 120 milch cows.  This appears to be a bigger herd size than is the case with our farmers but I am told there is not a significant economy of scale as one increases one's herd size beyond 100 cows.  The economies of scale do not get much better because one is obliged to pay paid labour, who probably will wish to work 40 hours per week, whereas a farmer probably would work for 60 or 70 hours a week.  Consequently, it does not necessarily provide one with a lower cost base.<\/p> <p>If farmers are not making a profit in either the North or South and are in competition in an environment of very powerful multiples, many of which were willing to come in to talk to us but one in particular of which was not, is there a common cause to ensure a fair return?  That is the bottom line.  There is a milk agency in the South whose only remit is to ensure an ongoing supply of winter milk.  On the day on which its representatives were here, they were quite explicit that if something does not happen, we could wind up with no liquid milk in two or three years in the months of January and February, for example.  It would obviously be a disaster if one could not buy fresh milk in the shops and had to use UHT as a reserve.<\/p><p> Is there a joint initiative possible, not to create a cartel for purchasers but to balance the relationship between the purchaser, processor and supermarket so it will be reasonably equal and so one part of the island will not be played off against the other to the detriment of farmers in both parts and, ultimately, the consumer?  The day on which there is no milk on the shelves will be the day on which the consumer will ask why nothing was done about it considering that it was predicted.<\/p><p>  We have approximately 1,800 dedicated liquid milk suppliers who supply all year round.  From the figures, it seems that the North has approximately 1,900.  Could Ms O'Neill confirm that they supply liquid milk throughout the year and are not supplying to dairies for the non-liquid milk market?  I am interested in knowing the number of liquid milk suppliers in Northern Ireland that trade in liquid milk for 52 weeks in the year.  As far as I am concerned, people who trade in liquid milk only in the summer are only piggybacking on the good times and do not incur the extra cost of producing milk when it is not very profitable to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900004#C00500","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373376000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Ms Michelle O'Neill MLA, and Mr. Conor Heaney.  What is encouraging in their presentation is the reference to the growing all-island aspect of agriculture and, I hope, fisheries.<\/p><p>  In regard to the fishery sector, we heard presentations recently from inshore fishermen, who represent the biggest part of our fleet.  Obviously, the sector is far more beneficial to our communities than individual arrangements.  The fishermen are finding it extremely difficult because of the costs of fuel and insurance and necessary safety changes.  In order to survive, a majority of the boats employ foreign nationals, as one might have noted from some of the tragedies that have occurred.  This is because the income is so small and people are not entering the industry.  Has an initiative to help the inshore fishermen been considered in the Six Counties?  In all fairness to them, they comprise the biggest contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas.  Particularly on the west coast, small fishing communities have been very badly hit as a consequence of successive policies that were implemented, particularly those of the European Union.<\/p><p>  The tackling of rural poverty and isolation was mentioned.  Ms O'Neill stated the allocation for this year is &euro;16 million while the figure for last year was &euro;10 million.  How is that distributed?  What areas in particular are targeted?  Rural isolation, which is typically experienced by single people on very small holdings, is a significant problem in the South.  Every member of this committee is well acquainted with the problem.<\/p><p>  Post offices throughout the country are one of the main points of contact for people who live in rural areas.  The ban on taking any alcohol must also be considered, and people are really confined to their houses.  Has Ms O'Neill any strategy in place to tackle that type of isolation?  Rural isolation gives rise to mental health problems.<\/p><p>  All of us, irrespective of our political persuasions, were greatly impressed by the manner in which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, tackled the horsemeat problem some months ago and last year.  Leadership came from the Minister and his Department.  What kind of co-operation existed between Ms O'Neill and our Minister, Deputy Coveney, in tackling the debacle?  Was any legislation brought forward regarding traceability, particularly regarding fillers for burgers?  The system for tracing such fillers' countries of origin was wide open to abuse.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Neill mentioned disease eradication.  Are there any specific geographic areas that are most affected?  A year to a year and a half ago, an area in the north Louth-south Armagh area was affected more than anywhere else, certainly more than anywhere else in the 26 counties.  Is there any formal structure in place between the Departments in the North and South to tackle the problem?  I hope there is.  If not, I hope it will be put in place because there is a problem.  To eradicate disease completely, there needs to be absolute co-operation on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has already mentioned flexibility and convergence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900005#D00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373376000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will try to cover as much as I can.  If there is any specific point to which I do not have an answer to hand, I will be happy to forward it to the committee afterwards.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the dairy sector.  The principle he was getting at was fairness in the supply chain.  That is the key to the success of the industry.  We have been very vocal on it in the North recently.  In my opening remarks, I mentioned we have just recently developed an agrifood strategy.  At its core, it recognises there is only one supply chain and that there needs to be fairness in it if everybody is to be successful.  The crux has to be about fairness in the supply chain.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to issues associated with milk, its origin, labelling and packaging.  We do not need to be arguing over that but looking towards the export market and where we can grow.  Since milk quotas are to be abolished in 2015, there is a massive opportunity that we need to be exploring together.  World markets like what we have to offer.<\/p> <p>World markets like the clean and green image that comes with our food.  We need to work collectively to appeal to these markets.<\/p><p> Regarding Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform, we have had broad discussions in the past 18 months, but the devil is in the detail.  We argued for flexibility which we now have.  We need to agree with the industry on the supports the CAP will provide.  There will be much competition between various sectors for supports.  One positive outcome of the CAP negotiations was that the young farmer scheme would become mandatory, a support welcomed across the board.  The age profile of farming needs to be challenged and we need to look at succession planning.  Having this scheme on a mandatory footing will assist in the time ahead.<\/p><p> Regarding the limit on fishing boat sizes, I think it might be under 10 m, but I will have to revert to the committee on that issue.  Drift-netting of salmon is banned, but it would come within the remit of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as it is an inshore fishery matter.<\/p><p> There are difficulties in the fishing industry.  The recent extreme weather meant fishing boats could not get out.  There have also been other challenges such as the rising cost of fuel.  We are working with the industry and have launched a research and development fund to assist fishermen to buy new nets.  We are all working to do away with discards and to achieve better vessel efficiency.  Many of the boats, particularly the smaller ones, could be more efficient.  We have put in place a package to assist fishing boats to buy new satellite monitoring systems.  This package comes to &pound;750,000.  Fuel costs, however, have meant many boats cannot get out to fish.  This is a challenge that will not make the industry sustainable.  Recently I announced a package to help fishermen with their operating costs.  They will be reimbursed their 2012 landing fee which will provide them with a ready cash flow.  We have to assist fishing communities, too.  I am reviewing the European fisheries funds to see if we can maximise the spend and get supports to these communities.<\/p><p> I am very passionate about tackling the issue of rural poverty.  While &pound;16 million does not sound like an impressive pot of money, some of the schemes we have launched with it have been positive.  We have been able to work with the Department for Regional Development on rural transport services, bore well schemes to provide access to water and the issue of youth employment in rural areas.  We also have the MARA, Maximising Access in Rural Areas, project which maximises access to benefits.  While a range of schemes have been successful, the main success has been that we have been able to leverage supports from other Departments.  It is about putting the rural agenda on the agenda of all Departments and ensuring they bring forward effective projects that are good for rural communities.<\/p><p> We recently launched a campaign at GAA, soccer and rugby grounds promoting positive mental health and tackling rural isolation.  I brought this forward with the sports Minister, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.  The Northern Ireland Executive has a focus on tackling rural isolation and mental health issues.  These projects make a real difference.<\/p><p> The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I corresponded frequently on the horsemeat incidents.  There were positive engagements.  The Food Standards Agency is the lead agency in the North which comes within the remit of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  If anything positive came out of this negative situation, it was that people wanted to see shorter supply chains and know from where their food came.  They are now more inclined to go to their local butcher and buy local produce.  That is the positive from this negative situation.<\/p><p> There are ongoing discussions at official level regarding animal disease controls and training exercises for tackling it.  At North-South Ministerial Council level I have regular discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on co-operation on disease controls.  EU animal health law will be key to having effective strategies in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373376600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

Cost will always drive cheaper food production.  Now that producers have shown they can have a longer supply chain, they will go back to this and we will see an increase in such food production.  What lessons did the Minister learn from this?  I am not talking so much about co-operation with us but more about what the Executive learned and about the role of the Food Standards Agency and whether she believes sufficient rules, regulations and authority are in place to say in so far as it is possible to do so that it will not happen again.  We can never say something will not happen again.  Although I know that, as politicians, we often like to say this, it is probably a waste of time.  In so far as we can make regulations as good as possible, what has been done in Northern Ireland as distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom?  What has the Minister learned and done?  Does she think any reputational damage was done to beef products from Northern Ireland?

During the spring which ran into the summer very quickly we faced a number of emergencies in the South.  Were there the same problems in Northern Ireland?  To what extent, compared to us, did it have problems with the forage issue?  If it did have problems, how did it tackle them and what measures has it put in place to ensure it will not have the same problem on a larger scale in the future?  The perception in the South was that fodder would be in very short supply coming into the winter because so much of it was used and that we would need extra amounts.  What measures has the Minister put in place to ensure extra supplies will be available?  How did she go about educating or meeting farmers or farming groups to give them extra incentives to produce or save more fodder for the winter ahead?<\/p><p>  On Senator Pat O'Neill's remarks about the multiples, we spent a lot of time in the past couple of months interviewing the different multiples.  We were trying to extract from them information on their relationship with the primary producers which at times was difficult.  As Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v noted, all bar one group came to see us.  They tried to convince us that they had a very good working relationship with the primary producers and that under no circumstances would they take \"hello money\".  I found this very dubious.  Over the weekend I visited a certain place which I will not mention which produces a certain type of food product and deals with a certain supermarket.  The producer told me straight up that it must provide a large amount of \"hello money\" to get into the market, but it could not say anything for obvious reasons because it would be de-listed.  Does Northern Ireland have the same experience such that it has had to introduce the grocery code of conduct about which we spoke?  While I accept that the groceries adjudicator is in its early stages, has it had any particular effect?  <\/p><p>  In respect of dairy farming mentioned by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I note that in the figures with which we were provided, the price per litre of milk in 2012 was 21.5 cent.  That figure sounds quite low to me.  As a dairy farmer, I would find it very difficult to continue to exist for very long with that kind of return from milk production.  I note that income in the dairy sector has increased by 19% in the period covered in the table the Minister has provided us with.  Inputs seem to be more or less at the same levels we have here.  It seems it is very difficult to continue to exist in a business with the same input levels but where the price range seems very low.  We are trying to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets whereby we hope to increase dairy levels by 50% between now and 2020, a fairly ambitious target.  Of the figures in front of us, if we are to compare like with like, it will be very difficult to achieve the targets we have set.  Does the Minister have any remark to make in that regard?  Does Northern Ireland have similar targets?<\/p><p>  On CAP reform, the perception is that, from a UK perspective, agriculture is the poor relation.  Obviously, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have much in common from an agricultural perspective.  Was it difficult for the Executive to get CAP reform on the agenda such that Northern Ireland would get as much as possible out of it?  The Minister says she is reluctant to discuss the menu of options.  What consultation process does she intend to put in place with the main stakeholders involved in the lead-up to the decisions that will be taken next September or October?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900007#F00300","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1373377200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Only Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh is left to speak.

Obviously, that is the ideal we all want to achieve.  Aligning our disease status was obviously key to moving forward on that issue.  EU animal health law will allow us to move more freely, but it is not due to come into effect until 2015 and there is still a way to go in negotiations on it.  Obviously, the committee will want to be involved in discussions in respect of the approach to be taken in the European Union.  That is the prize.  We want to be in a position where we will have free movement, but as we discuss implementation of the animal health law in 2015, the focus must be on disease status and making sure we will be in a similar position in order that there will be no barriers to trade and movement.  We will certainly be trying to do this.<\/p> <p> Senator Pat O'Neill referred to the impact of the dairy sector and what supports might be in place for other sectors, particularly the suckler cow scheme.  Because of what we have achieved in the European Union there is an option for availing of coupled payment support.  We can consider these measures.  It is something for which the beef industry has called in the past and we need to explore it as we move forward.<\/p><p> On the point about how I intend to engage in consultation on CAP reform, it will involve stakeholder meetings and hosting meetings for wider rural communities.  With regard to rural development programmes, consultation is needed in terms of the supports available.  We have started that process.  Now that we have come out the other side in getting the bigger political agreement, people want to be vocal on what they want to see in the new programme.  I want to make sure everybody involved will have an opportunity to do this.  We should align our policies, where possible, and look at areas where we have a common purpose.  We will certainly do this in the time ahead.<\/p><p> On the voluntary code of practice, as members are probably aware, the dairy sector is organised differently in the North in that most farmers are involved in co-operatives.  The way the process works is slightly different.  Their prices would have been set by milk auction, but that arrangement has been changed recently.  The process is slightly different in that respect, but as was said, prices are broadly similar in terms of the price per litre across the island.  <\/p><p> On the voluntary code of practice, those involved in the industry have taken the approach that they want it to be a voluntary code.  They have asked for time to work out how they want to implement it.  I will work with them on that issue and we will see how it progresses.  It comes back to fairness in the supply chain and everybody has to get his or her fair share.  If there is not fairness in the supply chain, the position will not be sustainable for those involved in part of that chain and this will have a big impact on the entire chain.  <\/p><p> The British Government has provided for the establishment of groceries code adjudicator.  The power in that respect is not devolved to the Assembly and we do not have the ability to introduce a groceries code adjudicator.  We have been trying to feed into the process.  If the adjudicator does not have teeth, there is no point in having such a position.  I  will reserve judgment as the position has only been established in recent weeks.  It is difficult to judge its impact until we see the office operating in practice and the way it will deal with the issues raised.  It is welcome that the office has been established and it is a step in the right direction.  It will be a challenging role for the body, but its establishment is welcomed.  At to whether it will have teeth and be effective, only time will tell.  If we have a discussion in six months' or a year's time, I will be able to talk more about it.  <\/p><p> The average age of farmers is 57 years.  That is something about which we must be seriously concerned.  We need to examine why young people would want to become involved in farming and how we can entice them to become involved and stay in it.  The day is gone when people automatically assumed that because their father or family was engaged in farming that the young people in the household would also enter the industry.  That we now have to put in place supports is a positive development.  It is also a positive sign that the agricultural colleges are oversubscribed.  That shows that young people see a future in farming, the food sector and the wider industry.  That is a positive indicator, on which I want to build.  I want to ensure we will have everything in place to support it.  I do a good deal of work with the young farmers' organisation and support those involved in the work they do in talking to their peers.  We will do more of this in the time ahead.  <\/p><p> On the timeframe for TB eradication, I wish there was a simple solution or a quick fix.  However, it is one of those difficult issues that has proved hard to crack.  The study we have brought forward will cover a number of years, probably three to four, as the information will have to be gathered, a model will have to be put in place and the work carried out.  I would be happy to provide the five or six page document we have available which details the project we are bringing forward which members might find interesting.  The incidence of TB in the Twenty-six Counties is lower than the level in Northern Ireland.  There may be a combination of reasons for this, one of the potential factors being that we still have a 100% compensation rate, an issue that needs to be examined.  We want to make sure we take every step possible to eradicate this disease in the time ahead.<\/p><p> On the horsemeat scandal, the Food Standards Agency was in the lead role in terms of the investigation carried out.  It sits outside the Assembly and the Executive, which was the downfall in terms of what happened.  I would like to see it being accountable to a Government Department.  The public that elects us wants to be able to hold somebody to account and when an outside body is in the lead role, as happened in this case, that does not happen.  I would like to see this changed, but I do not suppose that change will happen over night.<\/p><p> In terms of the lessons learned, there were plenty.  Inevitably, there is reputational damage until one comes out the other side of such a scandal.  One thing I noted was that the majority of our farmers participated in a farm quality assurance scheme.  If their meat had a farm quality assurance stamp on it, they were able to stand over its quality and traceability.  That was a standard about which we could boast throughout the scandal.  Since the scandal, quite a number of farmers have come forward to enrol in the scheme, which is a positive development for the industry.  They could see the benefit of participating in it.  In the past farmers asked me what was the benefit and what would they get out of it.  This was a clear example where they were able to see something they could get out of it.  Many of the major chains now state they will try to source 100% of their meat locally, but whether that is doable is another thing.  However, they have made that claim which is to be welcomed.  We will see how it develops.  <\/p><p> Deputy Martin Ferris raised the issue of the CAP pillars.  That issue is one of traceability which we all need to ensure is provided for in the time ahead.  <\/p><p> The agrifood strategy report that I mentioned is another tool under which we will examine all of the challenges facing the industry, the challenges faced on foot of the horsemeat scandal, as well as other issues, including the barriers to growth, what the government and the industry need to do to address them, how can we challenge each other and how can we work together.  That is important work which I look forward to seeing through in the time ahead.  <\/p><p> One of the recommendations made in the strategy report which was industry-led was that the Executive invest &pound;400 million in the industry and that, in return, the private sector invest &pound;1.3 billion.  That is doable and something we need to push forward.  I know the Executive is on board in seeking to be able to do this.<\/p><p> On the fodder scheme, we bought in 16,000 tonnes of fodder.  It was a very difficult time for the farming industry in general, but we also had instances where there was heavy snowfall which was beyond belief.  People were in dire straits and we had to move quickly to bring forward the scheme.  We need to plan for what will happen next.  We have put a task force in place, which includes departmental officials and representatives of the farming unions.  It has met twice and we are planning for what we will need to do in the period post-September, October and November.  We are also running courses for farmers in the agricultural colleges on fodder management and planning to ensure a winter feed supply.<\/p><p> On CAP reform and how we interacted with the British Government, we had significant differences in budget discussions.<\/p> <p>It was successful in that we managed to divorce the financial position from the agricultural council meetings in which we were involved.  We dealt with agricultural issues outside the financial discussions and this worked out well for us.  Throughout the discussions the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I corresponded a great deal, which was very effective in looking at the supports the entire island needed, for which we are very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373378400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and apologise for missing the beginning of her presentation.

In the Republic we have a strong sense of concern about the need for a well resourced suckler cow scheme, given the changeover in the dairy sector.  Does Ms O'Neill have such priorities?  Are there strongly held views in Northern Ireland on the debate between direct payments, flat rate payments and partial convergence?  <\/p><p>  With regard to young farmers and the issue of land mobility which is significant in the South, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, have attempted to address this issue in recent budgets and continue to do so.  It is based on our historical conacre system.  Is it as big a problem in Northern Ireland?  Ms O'Neill has mentioned that the average age of a farmer in the North is approximately 57 years and that the scheme for young farmers who are taking over is welcome.  Does she see a difficulty in getting older farmers to retire?  This needs to happen if young farmers are to take over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900009#H00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1373378400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Trying to come up with questions which have not been answered is a challenge, but I will do my best.<\/p><p>  A big debate took place here during the CAP negotiations on the definition of an active farmer and I still have not received an answer to it.  Where I come from, an active farmer is someone who must do a little bit of farming, a little bit of fishing and other things to keep going.  This links with Ms O'Neill's policy on rural poverty.  I ask her to speak to us about how poverty among farmers is measured.  She has stated rural issues are integrated into all Departments.  Are all policies rural proofed?  It does not happen here and would be a positive development.<\/p><p>  An issue raised with Deputy Martin Ferris and me on our travels throughout the country is eel fishing.  There is still a ban on eel fishing on this part of the island, but I do not believe it is banned in the Six Counties.  I ask Ms O'Neill to speak about this.  All of the eels seem to source from the same place and travel through all of the rivers.  It seems quite strange, therefore, that we still have a ban on eel fishing, but it is not banned in the Six Counties.<\/p><p>  Does Ms O'Neill have thoughts on how opening up the sugar beet market might benefit the entire island and how it might be approached on an all-Ireland basis?  Another hot potato here is turf cutting, which also raises the question of having sustainable rural communities and farmers.  Ms O'Neill mentioned fuel poverty as being an issue.  Is there an issue with turf cutting in the Six Counties?  It is very positive to see North-South co-operation and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, states the same when he comes before the Seanad or committees.  Are there impediments to this co-operation which could or should be removed?  How can we improve North-South co-operation on these issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900009#H00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373378400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh found plenty of questions to ask.  <\/p><p>  I believe the CAP negotiations were a success because while we need to move to a fairer system, people need time to adjust.  The Commission proposed an immediate steep drop of 40%, which was unfair.  The fact that we have been able to phase in the approach is a win in the negotiations.  If I were to state I had priorities, it would be picked up on and I do not want people to think it would be where we would definitely go.  <\/p><p>  The agrifood strategy board examined everything sector by sector and considered the challenges and supports required.  It is an obvious tool to use to shape our new rural development programme and the supports we will have available.  The timing has been quite good.  My starting point would be examining these challenges and considering how the rural development programme will be able to meet some of them.  I also want to consult industry.  We must be open-minded with regard to suckler cow schemes.  An area in which farmers often tell me they need support is building programmes as they have sheds and buildings which are years old, but they do not have the money to replace them.  We should examine this area.<\/p><p>  With regard to succession planning, I am delighted the young farmers' association in the North wants to examine this area and make suggestions on how to deal with it.  A number of officials visit farm families and speak to them about their options and help them with succession plans.  A family must come to the decision itself, but the officials help by explaining what it will mean and the implications for the entire family.  This is positive work.  <\/p><p>  We also have a very difficult conacre problem in the North.  It is an old tradition.  It is unfortunate that we were not able to deal with the active farmer issue as part of the negotiations and that the Commission steered away from dealing with it.  With regard to airports and golf courses, those who are not farming should not receive a single farm payment.  It is as simple as that.  A negative list has been agreed, but more discussions on the issue will take place.<\/p><p>  All departments must rural proof their policy discussions, but how effectively this is done is an issue.  We have created a ten minute video which is played as part of training for officials who work on policy, which explains it must be a factor and is something to which the Executive is committed, but it could be much more effective.<\/p><p>  With regard to eel fishing, I live on the shores of Lough Neagh which has one of the largest eel fisheries in Europe and it is very much a part of the community which has been brought up and reared on the eel fishery.  If it were ever to change, it would devastate the community.  Some attempts are being made in the European Union in this regard, but this eel fishery has a management plan in place.  It is being fished responsibly and takes sustainability of the industry into account.<\/p><p>  Sugar beet production is not an issue in the North.  With regard to targeting moneys towards tackling deprivation, we examine the deprivation statistics.  The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency publishes detailed geographical statistics for deprivation levels; therefore, our work can be targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle O'Neill"},{"type":"speech","time":1373378400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Neill, who has been very helpful in providing answers.  It would be interesting to have an all-Ireland approach to the CAP.  With regard to what Ms O'Neill stated about making changes over time, I have stated from the very beginning that is how I want it to happen and it must happen.<\/p> <p> I examined the definition of \"active farmer\".  Airports and so on are out, but there are other sneaky bits that could cause problems for people in the North and us, particularly in respect of commonages.  We can discuss this matter on another day.<\/p><p> In the past 20 years there has been a seismic change in the amount of milk coming to the South from the North.  In 1996 0% of liquid milk sold in the Republic came from the North.  By 2006 that figure had increased to 18%.  It is now 26%.  It is difficult to compare producer prices, as I do not have the annual averages.  In 1995 a farmer received 32.8 cent per litre.  In 2011 the amount was 35.5 cent.  It only increased by 2.7 cent.  The interesting element is that in 1995, 43% of what the consumer paid went to the farmer.  By 2011 that figure had decreased to 32% and consumers were not the big winners - the multiples were.<\/p><p> The National Milk Agency's role is not to control price but to ensure liquid milk is on shelves 365 days a year.  It was set up under the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act 1994.  The situation is growing more complex as the markets North and South become more integrated.  I am not against this.  The natural market is the island, but there cannot be an integrated all-Ireland market that ensures milk will be on the shelves 365 days a year without Northern milk being factored into the equation.  The concern facing farmers in the South is that, if more of them get out of the liquid milk business, we will become more dependent on Northern milk and that if the price of milk was to change on the island of Britain, Northern milk would go to Britain and our market would not be supplied, as Northern farmers would not be contractually bound to do so.  The National Milk Agency must ensure there are enough contracts to guarantee a milk supply for a certain period, but it cannot do this in respect of Northern milk.  If Northern milk was used to supply 40% of our market, only the Southern producers would be tied.  As free agents, Northern milk producers could shift milk to Britain.  Why would they not do so, if the price there was higher?  We would find ourselves with no milk on our shelves.  That is the stark reality.<\/p><p> I do not expect an instant reply, as this is a technical subject, on which we have spent a great deal of time.  When the National Milk Agency tells us that we could face a risk of not having milk two or three years down the road, this is the time to sit up.  I will cite an example of something that happens in the South.  Some 23% of milk in our supermarkets is provided by Dunnes Stores.  I understand all of the major supermarket chains recently agreed to give an increase to farmers of 7 cent per litre to take the significant cost of producing liquid milk last winter into account, given the sizable feed costs incurred.  Dunnes Stores refused to do this, which is putting pressure on supermarkets to reconsider their decision, as the market is competitive.  I understand Dunnes Stores sources a fair amount of its milk in the North.<\/p><p> The consumer does not gain in the long term.  The one element the consumer wants is guarantee of supply.  Farmers in the North do not seem to gain either.  Undercutting in our market means that they are being undercut.  On average, their production prices are no cheaper than ours.  I apologise for going around this issue, but it is an important one.  Our farmers are being squeezed.  I have nothing against Northern farmers, but they do not appear to be gaining either.  They sell at a very low price and I am sure they are complaining to the Minister about it.  Like all farmers, they want a better price.  The consumer is being put at long-term risk of not having fresh milk.  Is there an agency or group in the North charged with responsibility for ensuring liquid milk is on shelves in supermarkets 365 days a year, as is the case in the South?  If there is, the two agencies should work together on the issue of continuity of supply.  Although this relates to price, it is not an attempt to form a cartel; rather, it is an attempt to keep farming sustainable in order that milk will remain available.  Is there any way of holding an all-Ireland round-table discussion on the long-term supply of liquid milk?  The current arrangement is highly volatile.  If we run out of milk on the shelves, there will surely be a similar problem in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013070900009#H00500","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373379000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>It is an issue on which we must work and I will be happy to raise it with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, at tomorrow's meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council for further discussion.

We have tried to address it through our hearings on the grocery code of conduct.  We would be interested in seeing an interim report soon on the effectiveness or otherwise of the adjudicator in the United Kingdom.  We have been told <i>ad nauseam<\/i> by representatives of the retailers that it is not necessary to create a statutory code and that they are satisfied that a voluntary code rolled out across Europe would be effective.  However, this is difficult to believe in the light of the anecdotal evidence available.  It is only anecdotal because, for good reason, people are not prepared to go on the record.<\/p><p>  The North has an envelope under the Common Agricultural Policy and it is treated as a region.  It could work closely with the arrangements being made by our Department for convergence and coupling for young farmers.  To suit both, we should be as close as possible.

There is a definite advantage in trying to consider the matter together and the likes of the North-South Ministerial Council and other forums are very good.  We hope this has been a good opportunity for the Minister to outline some of the points that may not be articulated at ministerial meetings.

I will, however, try to keep to five minutes.<\/p><p>  This discussion is, in a sense, very timely.  I met the committee in February after we had just published the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  As we are now starting the process of engaging in consultation on the plan for 2014, it is timely to meet the committee.<\/p> <p> I do not need to remind members of the action plan, but its concept is twofold.  First, it tries to mobilise all Departments in the task of creating employment.  Second, quarterly reporting means we harvest whatever is put forward.  There is a strong sense of meeting these targets on time, which shows that we are delivering on the priority we have ascribed to the plan.  By and large, the system has responded very well.  A figure of over 90% has been delivered in all quarters in which we sought to deliver.  Some things have proved more difficult, but most of them, though not all, are connected with the legislative process.  It can be difficult to get the timing right for legislation; even with ambitions, one cannot have the desired timing.  <\/p><p> Since February a number of things have happened that are worth recording.  As the committee will know, the research prioritisation exercise seeks to identify key business areas and is within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  On the back of that scheme, we announced funding for seven Science Foundation Ireland research centres a couple of months back.  They will be larger than in the past and there will be much more collaboration across the higher education institutes.  Most importantly, they are characterised by industrial funding to a level of 30% which is designed to ensure their work is relevant.  We will continue to build centres of excellence and full details are available.  They are in areas in which Ireland has an edge and include a data analytical centre; a perinatal centre, one of our very specific centres of excellence; and one in the pharmaceutical sector in which we also have a very strong track record.  The centres focus on areas where we have opportunities.<\/p><p> The committee will be interested to know that we launched our first local enterprise office in Fingal and that work is ongoing.  As members will know, local enterprise offices will offer a first-stop-shop to enterprises.  They will also develop centres of excellence, in place within Enterprise Ireland; develop policy for small and micro start-ups and tap into the local authorities, the most fundamental influence in terms of business opportunities in a local context.  That is the ambition and the programme is being rolled out. <\/p><p> It is worth noting that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has moved very strongly to fund SMEs, with  &euro;850 million available to bring in partners.  We are beginning to build a spectrum of SME funding options.  The total is &euro;2.5 billion for micro finance, loan guarantees, development capital, seed and venture capital and the new NPRF funding which includes equity and restructure finance.  We are beginning to see the emergence of a stable of SME options.  As the committee will know, access to finance remains challenging and needs continuing work.<\/p><p> We have published the manufacturing strategy and 2014 will be characterised by how we decide to take on that issue.  We have introduced a number of innovations this year and I shall outline one of them.  A number of industrial partners are providing assistance, particularly in the roll-out of the seven disruptive reforms.  Their influence has been helpful and acted as a catalyst in bringing in partners to help the system to respond with greater ambition and a greater sense of combined purpose with industry.<\/p><p> Yesterday we published the JobsPlus initiative in response to complaints from businesses about the lack of cash up-front in some of the existing schemes.  For example, if one recruits a person who is out of work for over 12 months from the live register, one gets cash up-front, which is paid monthly in arrears.  It is &euro;72 per week for a person who is out of work for one year which increases towards &euro;100 per week for someone who is out of work for two years.  Cash in hand helps cash flow and we hope the scheme will prove attractive.  <\/p><p> Last week Forf&aacute;s published positive employment figures for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies.  It confirmed that there were 9,600 additional people working.  It also confirmed growth in a broad range of sectors and regions.  On the export oriented side, there is a good spread.  The CSO's quarterly national household survey of employment has confirmed these trends and that the number employed has increased by 20,000 in the last quarter, of whom around 10,000 are in export oriented sectors.  That proves building export oriented sectors has a knock-on effect on the wider domestic economy.  <\/p><p> We have tried to incorporate the committee's reports on unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, into our policy.  However, many of the reports refer more to the sectors within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Education and Science rather than my own.  The apprenticeship review is under way and I hope it will lead to changes.  We are examining the possibility of including social clauses in Government contracts to give preference giving work to unemployed persons.  An interdepartmental group is examining how to assist the retail sector which I know has been a source of concern for the committee.  <\/p><p> One of the committee's reports was on skills in the ICT sector.  We have done some follow-up work on that sector in terms of rolling out additional personnel with these skills and making the permits system easier to use.  <\/p><p> The committee has also raised the issue of mentoring.  We are looking afresh at mentoring now that we have brought the local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland under the same umbrella.  We shall try to co-ordinate mentoring activities more effectively to give a better service, provide specialists and so on.  We have commenced work in that regard.<\/p><p> We have also appointed a group to examine the issue of entrepreneurship under the chairmanship of Mr. Sean O'Sullivan.  It will examine whether we can do more.  Recent numbers show there has been a decline in the number of start-ups, which clearly reflects the economic climate.  However, we have seen continuing growth in some segments.  We, therefore, need to take a fresh look at the issue of entrepreneurship to see if we can do more.  The group will report in the short timeframe of a maximum of three or four months.<\/p><p> A consultative phase will commence shortly and we are keen to receive submissions from the committee or individual members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900002#A00500","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373373000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>We will probably do a bit of both.

I apologise in advance as I will have to leave early.  As this is the first time the Minister has met the committee since the conclusion of the EU Presidency, I compliment him and all of the officials on their accomplished work.  His Department probably had to shoulder the greatest burden during the Presidency.  We can measure the outcomes on another day.  A massive personal effort was made by the Minister, his ministerial colleagues and all of the officials involved.  They deserve full credit for their work.<\/p><p>  I wish to discuss the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is a little like Santa Claus; one wants to believe, but all the evidence suggests he is not real.  I will outline a few issues, one of which is a bugbear of mine.  I tabled a jobs-related parliamentary question to the Minister, asking him what actions were taken at EU-wide level to assist young people in obtaining employment; the way the measures would translate here; and if he would make a statement on the matter.  However, my question was transferred to the Minister for Social Protection.  Perhaps the first disruptive reform should involve somebody taking charge.  The Minister for Social Protection may answer the question but only on the basis of social protection measures.  This is an ongoing issue.  For example, a question on SME finance is automatically forwarded to the Department of Finance, which means that it is very difficult, bar at these sessions, to get direct answers on various issues.<\/p> <p>Can we try to resolve something over the summer break in order that there will be a central way of answering jobs-related questions instead of trying to work out which Minister is in charge of job creation for those under 25 years?  Presumably, if one is under 25 years, one's future is a concern of the Department of Social Protection, while for the over-25s, it is a concern of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> With regard to structural reforms, the partners the Minister has involved in rolling out reforms are excellent.  Will he give us an indication of where they are at, what they have achieved and the backup they receive?  He mentioned funding options for SMEs, a key part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  Will he outline where we are on the microfinance and credit guarantee schemes?  Concerns have been expressed about the pricing of both schemes and the relatively low take-up.  <\/p><p> On the retail side, the Minister mentioned that an interdepartmental committee had been appointed.  Have terms of reference been agreed to?  I hope it will be looking at the issue of multiples using their powers.  Last week saw reports in the newspapers on a major multiple challenging the industry to support its marketing budgets.  Legislation is due from the Department in respect of multiples and the retail sector.  Where are we in that regard?<\/p><p> Will the Minister confirm that JobsPlus is an initiative of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Social Protection?  In that context, there are 2,400 places available, which makes it sounds like a great scheme.  What sense is there that places will be filled by December?  Has there been any interaction on a JobsPlus budget for next year?  We had the big launch in Waterford yesterday.  Will there be a roll-out of JobsPlus around the country?  That has been the big issue in respect of the credit guarantee and microfinance schemes.  They were announced and then parked as if they were the world's best kept secrets.  What marketing roll-out will there be on JobsPlus?  Will people with the capacity to create jobs be targeted?  We need business to business marketing.  Businesses need to be told about it rather than engaging in general advertising that will not reach home.  Will the Minister work with the Companies Registration Office?  It could mail its clients.  The Revenue Commissioners could also be involved.  The business community needs to know about the scheme if it is to work.  As JobsPlus is not an initiative of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister may not be able to answer this point.<\/p><p> The Minister has staked much of his personal credibility on the export sector.  He is redefining the economy and job creation.  Figures for the last quarter show a halt in export related jobs and there are issues concerning the patent cliff.  We have oral questions tomorrow, but what are we doing specifically about the patent cliff, given the impact the expiry of patents can have on our export markets?  The Science Foundation Ireland initiatives are welcome.  What work is the Minister doing with companies to try to address the issue as a matter of urgency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900003#B00300","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373373600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire mar gheall ar a chuid cur i l&aacute;thair.  We are approaching the halfway point of the Government's term.  Job creation is the biggest issue and was the biggest issue in the 2011 general election and the fiscal treaty referendum.  The Government promised 100,000 additional new jobs by 2016.  The household survey figures for the first quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2011, when the Government took office, show that the labour force has shrunk by 11,000 people, that the number in employment has increased by 3,800, that the number of full-time jobs has decreased by 10,700, that the number of part-time jobs has increased by 14,400 and that the level of under-employment has increased by 30,000.  There is an increase of 3,800 jobs and the vast majority, according to the household survey figures for the past two years, are part-time jobs.  The budget of the Department shows that each of the 3,800 jobs cost &euro;442,350.  This can be seen as an exaggeration because the money was not spent across all of the labour market, but the level of job creation in the past two years, given the priority accorded it was meant to receive, is phenomenally poor.  This has a direct effect on every household in the State.  Some 150 jobs have been created on a monthly basis since the Government came to power.  Therefore, the chances of obtaining the figure of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016 are very slim, if not near impossible.  Does the Minister agree that it is time to redefine achievable targets and jettison the 100,000 jobs target outlined initially?<\/p><p>  There is lovely rhetoric on procurement in the detail of the document, but the Small Firms Association was in Leinster House last week and very clear on the message that \"New Government buying policies have the potential to eliminate small businesses from the tendering process, resulting in business closures, job losses, regional imbalance and ultimately less competition in the marketplace\".  The OPW is not within the remit of the Minister, but the Small Firms Association cited it as not having job creation on its radar and not considering it as an issue.  We can see procurement contracts being continually rolled up such that it is made more difficult for small businesses to tender for them.<\/p><p>  A considerable amount of legislation identified in the 2012 action plan has not been completed.  There are delays in Bills dealing with legal services, workplace relations, the introduction of local enterprise offices, LEOs, companies, competition and consumers.  These are under the control of the Department and were highlighted in the 2012 action plan.  They have not been dealt with.<\/p><p>  In the Action Plan for Jobs there is a 50% target for foreign direct investment outside Cork and Dublin.  The 2013 document does not mention this target, but IDA Ireland still uses it.  There is real concern in the regions that jobs are not being attracted there.  There are several figures showing that Meath and other counties do not receive IDA Ireland visits, never mind having the opportunity to attract companies to local areas.  I also want to deal with micro-enterprise and other issues later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900004#C00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1373373600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Dara Calleary for his compliments to the staff of the Department.  A superhuman effort was made across all areas.  There was Horizon 2020, a trade deal and accountancy directives.  Many people who stayed at home had to take up the slack to keep the ordinary work going.  It was a major effort and I thank the Deputy for his comments.<\/p><p>  While the Action Plan for Jobs seeks to harness the entire Government to focus on employment creation, that does not mean that I am responsible in the House for questions in areas that fall outside my remit.  I can understand the Deputy's frustration, but EU youth employment measures, with funds of &euro;6 to &euro;8 billion, will virtually all be covered in interventions by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  That is the way it is structured, with ESF money, and it is not within the arena of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Therefore, I am not answerable for it.  Clearly, we seek to give an enterprise view of what is relevant through the high level group on skills needs and seek, through this process, to ensure opportunities are available.<\/p> <p>No doubt much of it will be used to fund Momentum, Springboard and JobBridge.  They must be associated with enterprises which are capable of growing.  That is where we have a common purpose.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of the multiples.  That is part of the consumer legislation on which we are continuing to work.  We hope to publish it this month, but getting through the legislative process is challenging.  The Deputy is right that the test of the success of JobsPlus will be in its roll-out.  As we did last year for Government schemes, we will use the CRO, our own enterprise offices and every channel at our disposal to promote not only this scheme but others which are very relevant to business, whether to access finance which the Deputy rightly recognised, seed capital, tax breaks and so on.  We will produce promotional material to be used online.  This year we will have the one-stop-shop process through the local enterprise offices.<\/p><p> The Deputy is right that the last quarter export numbers were somewhat surprising.  A lot of things are happening.  As the Deputy rightly said, some products are coming off patent which will impact on the value of the trade.  Some of our trading partners have been in real difficulty, but the underlying employment numbers in these sectors have been pretty solid.  We need to see a little-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900004#C00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373374200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The underlying numbers are solid enough, but if the trend of the last quarter continues, it will impact on employment.

We have definitely done a lot of work.  As job numbers in the pharmaceutical sector have been stable, there has been no impact on employment.  Part of that is due to the fact that IDA Ireland is looking at new opportunities in the bio-pharmaceutical and other sectors.  While we are inevitably losing jobs in some sectors, we are expanding elsewhere.  As the Deputy acknowledged, we have established the Synthesis and Solid State Pharmaceutical Centre in the University of Limerick as the nucleus.  It is a &euro;40 million investment, 30% of which has come from industry.  All of the large pharmaceutical companies are involved.  We are assisting, through IDA Ireland, normal transformation supports but also this special research centre to try to assist companies to reposition.  There are opportunities in this sector, with the convergence of IT and pharmaceuticals, and the trick is to try to stay ahead of these trends.  Employment levels actually grew in this sector, despite the patent cliff problems.  It is encouraging that the strategy is working.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's portrayal of what was happening was a little unfair.  I know there is an element of political presentation, but if one is coming from an economy losing jobs at a rate of 90,000 per year, one is not going to suddenly see a surge into the positive zone.  Seeing 20,000 net extra people at work in the past 12 months is an encouraging sign and it certainly does not dispose me to change our target of 100,000 by the end of 2016.  That remains our target and we should continue to work towards it.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy is right that the national quarterly household survey figures showed that a large proportion of the new jobs created were part-time, but, interestingly, in the last two quarters alone there has been growth in the full-time dimension.  The other interesting piece of evidence is that if one looks only at the October numbers for the agencies, the full-time work figures completely dominated the part-time work figures.  The agencies' October numbers showed that of the new jobs created - roughly 9,600 - only 700 were part-time, which means that the vast majority of the additional jobs were full-time.  We are seeing a pattern as we come out of the recession where initially there was only part-time employment available.  I hope the indications are that more of the jobs will be full time.  In terms of agency-supported employment which is predominantly export driven, it is encouraging to see the very high proportion of full-time jobs in its portfolio of companies.  Clearly, this is an issue.  There are patterns of part-time working with which one would not be happy, but there is also legitimate expansion whereby people start off in part-time jobs.  <\/p><p>  I refer to one of the exciting things about JobsPlus.   A large number of sectors are moving into the plus zone where they are actually expanding employment across a range of operations.  This is a good time to introduce a simplified measure to help people to take employees off the long-term unemployment lists.  There are conditions in that one must be working 30 hours and at least four days a week.  The Government incentives which we are putting in place are very much geared towards creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment.  <\/p><p>  I accept the point made about procurement.  There is a dilemma.  When one has to consolidate public spending and if one can purchase more efficiently, it saves cutting staff, front-line services or raising taxes.  Naturally, a forensic look at public procurement must be part of any fiscal correction.  We have been trying to ensure that while we must get value from public procurement, we do not put obstacles in the way of SMEs.  The new national procurement officer has been promoted and he is seeking to ensure SME access.  The Department of Finance has rules about tendering such that one does not bundle packages of work such that SMEs cannot possibly tender for them and one does not have unnecessarily high thresholds for insurance requirements.  That has been included in the criteria for tendering.  <\/p><p>  We also have a number of very successful programmes whereby Enterprise Ireland is working with the procurement service and InterTradeIreland.  In terms of value for money, InterTradeIreland's initiative on public procurement is showing the best performance of any of its programmes in terms of the return to business.  There are opportunities for SMEs if they participate in some of these programmes to access funding.  Yesterday we were in Waterford and the head of the county enterprise board, soon to be a local enterprise office, pointed out that it published in an e-zine.  All of the electronic tenders are put to a rake of businesses in the area and from its monitoring, many of them are not opened.  Many businesses do not think about public procurement as an opportunity.  We are, therefore, trying to work with companies to open up access.  Later in the week we will meet the new procurement officer to outline some of the concerns raised with the Deputy and which are continually raised with us.  One of the things we are obviously keen to see is more innovative procurement - in other words, one would tender to solve a problem rather than putting out a tender involving large quantities and materials.  That gives small businesses a much better chance.  <\/p><p>  I accept that the legislative programme is behind schedule.  We have not been able to meet all of our deadlines.  Much of this has been due to the fact that troika work had precedence.  Last year we fast-tracked our competition legislation to meets its requirements on penalties and so on, of which Deputies were critical.  That pushed everything out of the way.  There are problems in getting things through, but we are working really well and have better arrangements in place with the Office of the Attorney General.  I hope that as a result we will be able to improve the flow.  <\/p><p>  The credit guarantee scheme is showing an improved take-up.  On 5 July the figure was &euro;6.5 million; therefore, it is up considerably.  There are 49 live cases.  Between the two schemes, 414 jobs were created or maintained.<\/p> <p> In the case of microfinance, the loan value is &euro;1.3 million, which figure relates to 79 microenterprises and the approval rate is 45%.  They are beginning to gain traction and we are continuing to promote them.  We recently had meetings with one of the banks.  We will meet all of them to make sure those who are refused loans are alerted to this programme at the point of refusal, which is the critical point.  Approximately 24,000 small businesses have been refused loans.  If we can get one quarter of these to apply for microfinance, we will believe we are accessing our target group.  We are trying to secure better arrangements with the banks in order that people will be alerted.<\/p><p> The final issue raised by the Deputy was the question of regional spread.  To be fair, the regional spread in the Enterprise Ireland and Forf&aacute;s figures is not bad, even if it is not ideal.  Just one region did not see an expansion in employment.  Most of the regions outside Dublin saw increases of 5,600, 5,800 and 1,200.  If I had my calculator, I could give the Deputy all of the figures which are in the public domain.  We are seeing a spread.  The Deputy will be aware that the foreign direct investment projects we are winning are increasingly focused on the deep labour and skills pools found in the cities.  That is a feature of the profile of the projects we are winning.  We are trying to expand this, for example, by placing an emphasis on emerging companies and developing the Connect Ireland programme.  We are trying to put new tools in the field to attract foreign direct investment that is less likely to need to be based in large urban centres.  That work is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900005#D00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I also asked about the partners involved in rolling out reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900006#E00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>The reforms are proceeding.

Good progress is being made in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, recently established a &euro;70 million energy fund, with &euro;35 million coming from the Government's funds and matching funds coming from the private sector.  That fund is now up and running and those involved are identifying pilot projects in the public and private sectors that can be funded.  A fresh crop of skills initiatives is being advanced under Springboard.  We will meet officials in the Department of Education and Skills next week to examine how further initiatives in this area can be pursued.  SOLAS which will have a new mandate is being established.  It represents a great opportunity to develop ICT and wider skills.  An apprenticeship review is also being carried out and we intend to bring new legislation on work permits to the House.  In line with the report put together by Senator Deirdre Clune, the legislation is designed to make it easier for people who are legitimate to access those needed to meet skills shortages when such workers cannot be sourced in Ireland.  We are moving in all of these areas and I think we can report progress.  As I have said, the addition of a private sector partner has caused us to think outside the box in each of these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900006#E00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>If Deputy Anthony Lawlor and Senator Feargal Quinn do not mind, I propose to allow Senator Mary M.

He is always welcome here.  I congratulate him on the success of the EU Presidency.<\/p><p>  The Minister has mentioned that the Action Plan for Jobs relates to a number of Departments.  Which of them is the lead Department in this regard?  <\/p><p>  The Leader programme, a significant source of funding for start-up companies and businesses in rural areas, is run by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine comes into it also.  <\/p><p>  The aim of the JobsPlus scheme which was launched yesterday and the Pathways to Work scheme is to get young people back to work.  As Deputy Dara Calleary said, the Department of Social Protection is responsible for these schemes.  I want to find out what is the lead authority.  What Department looks after the questions asked about this matter?<\/p><p>  I appreciate that the Minister is not directly responsible for the JobsPlus scheme.  As it focuses on people who have been unemployed for longer periods of time, it could be said to discriminate against people who receive short-term contracts of two or three months before going back to square one and trying to find employment once more.  When one examines the figures, one finds that even when there was full employment, almost 60,000 people were deemed to be long-term unemployed.  Such persons are being given more opportunities than those who take up short-term work and then have to go to the back of the queue.  It seems unfair that employers who are trying to maximise the amount of money they receive from the Department are being asked to take on those who have been out of the workforce for a longer period of time, rather than those who have managed to find some short-term work.  Perhaps something might be done in that regard.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned to the Minister previously, many small and medium-sized enterprises are caught in a gap - they are too big to receive microfinance and too small to avail of some of the larger financial packages available.  Most of them encounter short-term cash flow problems that last a couple of months.  I ask that something be done to assist them.  <\/p><p>  I welcome today's announcement that the growth figure for the UK economy, one of our biggest trading partners, has been revised upwards to 0.9%.  I have also noticed figures which suggest the level of unemployment among women has remained fairly static in the past year, whereas the level among men has dropped.  Some will say they are all leaving the country, but that is not true.  There has been a dramatic drop in the level of male unemployment, but the level of female unemployment seems to be remaining static.  Can we do something to encourage more females who are unemployed back into the workforce?  Perhaps we might take the same approach to the entrepreneurial fund that we took in the case of youth employment when we provided for a young person's bonus.  We might look at what we can do to support females who want to come forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900006#E01500","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  It is interesting to hear about the range of targets he is setting for himself.  I am concerned that in recent years we seem to have lost the belief people should create their own jobs.  Perhaps we never had it.  People seem to wonder about what the Government or somebody else will do to create jobs for them.<\/p> <p>The task of the Government is to encourage entrepreneurship.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Sean O'Sullivan had been chosen as chairman of the forum on start-ups for entrepreneurs.  If we are to succeed in this area, we must ensure it is made more attractive to start, set up, develop, make profitable and expand businesses.  We are not doing nearly enough in that regard, although we are doing a lot to create jobs.  I continually hear people ask what the Government or somebody else is going to do, rather than thinking about what they can do themselves.  The two sectors I consider targets for a fast response in this regard are retail and tourism, on both of which the Minister touched.  I see huge opportunities for the use of the Internet in the retail sector.  Young people seem to be able to grasp this early.  I would love to see an attitude change and for people to realise that not all jobs will be created by somebody else, that sometimes we must create them ourselves.  I am sure that with Mr. O'Sullivan as chairman of the forum on start-ups for entrepreneurs we will not lose sight of this.  Too many people sit back and ask what more they can do to find work once they have written an application.  However, large numbers around the country are setting up small enterprises that they are growing and developing.  They may only employ one or two people now, but that is how every big business started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900006#E01600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373375400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Deputy Anthony Lawlor raised the same issue as Deputy Dara Calleary.  What we are trying to do with the Action Plan for Jobs is to work across the silos, but the fact that we are engaging in co-ordination across them does not mean that we are in charge of the respective programmes.  What we are trying to do is something a little different.  Therefore, if members want to raise questions about Leader or social protection schemes, it is not my Department that is answerable.  What we do is try to ensure we work in a collaborative way.  This is particularly true in areas such as the disruptive reforms, where there must be cross-government participation in order to deliver them successfully.  I understand people would like to be able to direct their questions relating to various Departments to one Minister, but that is not what we are trying to do.  We are trying to promote collaboration and are having some success in that regard.<\/p><p>  The only type of work excluded by JobsPlus is seasonal work such as when an employer takes on a person to do a job that is not intended to be long term.

Last year some 140,000 left the live register.  Of these, 120,000 were unemployed for less than 12 months and only 20,000 for over 12 months.  Looking at the percentages, the chance of finding a job if one is long-term unemployed is only one in nine, but if one is unemployed for only a short time, it is quite high, at 66%.<\/p><p>  What we are saying through the scheme is that we need to give people a chance who otherwise could drift into being long-term unemployed and become detached from the workplace.  What we need to do is bring them back into the workforce.  Whether they have spent the past 12 months on F&Aacute;S courses or participating in JobBridge or community employment schemes, we want to use this programme to get as many of them as possible who are now 12 months or more out of work back into the jobs market.  The scheme has been deliberately targeted at them.  It is not just a subsidy for an employer to recruit an employee, it also seeks to help a disadvantaged group.  Many of the programmes involve people who are coming off JobBridge, community employment or F&Aacute;S courses; therefore, significant preparatory work has been done in preparing them for the jobs market.  With good matching between the new Intreo offices and employers, we can deliver on this commitment.<\/p><p>  The Deputy correctly identified a problem in the SME sector, namely, the difficulty in accessing funding for cash flow for larger companies.  We are undertaking a review of the loan guarantee scheme to examine whether some of the conditions are too restrictive.  This seems to be an area in which there is a gap in funding, at which we will look as part of the review.  If the Deputy has experience with regard to specific companies, we would like to work on it.  He has already referred one company to me.<\/p><p>  On the trend in unemployment as regards women versus men, in the early part of the recession the level of male employment was hugely higher.  The rate for men is still much higher than for women.  The first dislocation of people from the construction sector had a massive impact.  Many of the long-term unemployed are male.  Therefore, it is encouraging to see an improvement.  I agree that there are probably new areas with untapped opportunities to promote entrepreneurship among women.  Last year we allocated &euro;750,000, in two tranches, for competitive start-ups by women.  This was massively over-subscribed and a very successful programme.  It is encouraging in the number of people starting up businesses this year that the number involving women has risen.  The signs are that women are beginning to become more actively involved in entrepreneurship.  We are also looking at the suggestion of dedicating part of the initiative headed by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan for young entrepreneurs.<\/p><p>  On the point made by Senator Feargal Quinn, the decline in entrepreneurship in Ireland can be traced to the economic circumstances.  Retail and consumer-led sectors were certainly hit by the recession, while export-targeted sectors held up better.  High-potential start-ups are doing well, as is the competitive sector, such as companies starting up in applications.  When I meet European colleagues, I understand we have a better environment to develop these areas.  We have tax relief which allows a person to put six years of PAYE tax payments into his or her company.  This concession is not generally available in other countries.  Enterprise Ireland's seed and venture funding scheme is far more developed than that in any comparative agency in the rest of Europe.  We now also have microfinance.  However, I agree that we are still not tapping this space enough and that is the reason we are looking for new ideas.  Perhaps we might promote these opportunities better in order that people will be more aware of them and look out for specific groups on which we have missed out.<\/p><p>  One enterprise on which we are working is the high-skill start-up.  Some of our research and innovation budget is going to centres that promote spin-out.<\/p> <p>We have about ten spin-out companies per year from SFI type work, at the high end of technology, as opposed to the retail end of tourism.  These companies also spin out licensed technologies.<\/p><p> As the seed capital schemes apply to all sectors since November 2012, the retail and tourism sectors are no longer excluded.  As they used only to apply to manufacturing and internationally traded services, it is a boost for people involved in these sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900007#F00800","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373376000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thought two committee members, in their remarks at the beginning of the meeting, were overly critical of the Government's performance in the past couple of years, as if we had inherited a normal economy in normal times.  It is important to remember the context.  This country had lost its credibility on the international stage and it has been an extraordinary task to reinstate and win it back.  We have to keep that context in mind.<\/p><p>  What I identify with the Minister are his energy, commitment and dedication to the high end of the economy.  The ideas, techniques, technology and vision are almost iconoclastic.  I do not understand it all, but I find it very exciting and that it has a lot of credibility because we realise people in the Department know what they are on about.  This is showing results on the ground and part of the narrative of restoration of reputation that Ireland is pulling from the sinking ship era of a couple of years ago.  However, this is only half the picture.  I am very concerned about the lack of focus and investment in areas in which there is huge clustering of unemployed persons in urban communities, where personal, community and family instability is being engendered by people not working, losing the dignity of work and the income related with work, particularly for former construction workers.  The trickle down effect of the Minister's endeavours will not extend far enough, quickly enough or deeply enough to raise the hopes and aspirations of the families of the people concerned.  We must look at that issue.  We must bring forward practical ideas to restore hope and restore belief in communities that something positive can be done.  This malaise must be recognised and tackled.  I cannot see why big labour intensive projects such as the DART and St. James's Hospital extensions are not being prioritised.  There are hundreds of construction jobs tied into these projects.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for agreeing to come to Ballyfermot College which has shown in the past 30 years how the creative industry can create jobs in unexplored areas such as animation, film making, the music industry and so on.  The creative sector received no investment, other than teachers' salaries.  This is extraordinary.  An entire genre of film making has been reinvented at Ballyfermot College without investment, except in teachers' salaries.  I know that the Minister has come to look at it, but it is an inspirational story in the past 25 years.  We must focus on these areas of high unemployment, where even community employment schemes are barely financed enough.  We must realise how important such schemes are to keep people's dignity afloat.  We must examine the pittance people receive when they go back onto a community employment scheme.  We must make the scheme a base for the social economy.  We need to build a social economy which encompasses the human values associated with the social economy across Europe.  Ours is the most fragile in Europe; it is non-existent and the community employment scheme could be its bedrock.  <\/p><p>  We need to look at these areas in which there are thousands of people without work.  If we leave them without work, hope will evaporate and we will have serious community issues that will be impossible to tackle if they move beyond a certain point.  We need to start focusing on them.  If some other Minister can do what this Minister has done at the high end in some of the areas I am highlighting, we certainly will be addressing the full picture, rather than half of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900008#G00200","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1373376000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and hope he enjoyed his visit to Waterford and the very sunny south east yesterday.  The previous speaker said some of the contributions had a political context to them.  I do not think we should apologise for this because we have to be honest about where we are.  The jobs crisis is still the single biggest issue facing the people.  We still have far too many out of work and far too many young people who are emigrating.  While the Minister is very busy, the benchmark on which I will judge him and the Government is not the high standard that I set for myself.  My standards would be higher than those of the Minister, as is my ambition of where we need to be, but we are benchmarking the Government's performance on the targets the Minister set such as creating 100,000 net jobs and others that simply have not been met.  That is a fair assessment of where we are.   We have a job to do to represent the people we represent at meetings such as this.  If people think that is political, fair enough, but that is our job.  One of the Minister's targets was to attract 50% of foreign direct investment to locations outside Cork and Dublin.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and is one of the targets that has not been reached.  <\/p><p>  One of the issues that comes up in some regions - the south east has the highest unemployment rate - is the grant aid available to companies.  The BMW region has a more favourable grant aid figure than the south east, in spite of its higher unemployment rate.  Can this issue be examined?  We need to look at regional disparities in foreign direct investment.  One of the previous speakers spoke about site visits and how some regions and counties simply had not received the level of support they needed from IDA Ireland.  When IDA Ireland has tried to attract foreign direct investment to some regions and counties, there has often been a lack of property solutions.  Again, that is where the Minister needs to have a joined-up approach.  He spoke about collaboration between Departments.  We need collaboration between local authorities to make sure we can make these property solutions available.  We need to attract foreign direct investment across the State to ensure balanced regional development and to ensure this we need property solutions.  We could then develop clusters in some sectors.<\/p><p>  I recognise that the Government is doing a lot of good work, but there are opportunities in three sectors, the first of which is agriculture.  It is important that there be a joined-up approach and that we do not have a silo mentality or approach as we adopted in the past with previous Governments.  Agriculture provides great job opportunities.  We have the abolition of the milk quotas and the Harvest 2020 targets to achieve.  If we want jobs to be created in the sector, we will have to look at providing employment supports, as well as banking support, for farmers if they want to increase production.  If this is a key growth sector, what measures is the Department putting in place to ensure we achieve these targets to create the necessary jobs?  <\/p><p>  The life sciences and medical devices sector was mentioned.  The expiry of patents is one problem the sector faces, but there are also challenges in terms of the cost of research and development.  Global over-capacity is also a problem, as well as competition from Asia.<\/p> <p>As the life sciences and medical device sectors continues to offer significant opportunities, what holistic strategy is in place to combat and deal with these challenges?  We need to recognise and overcome these challenges and then make sure we exploit the available opportunities.  Aside from the expiry of patents, there is the issue of research and development.  In this regard, we need to co-ordinate the work of the institutes of technology and the universities.<\/p><p> I refer to the tourism sector.  The Gathering is an important event which is good and great for the country.  It has obviously boosted tourist numbers.  Many regions of the country regard tourism as a key driver of job creation and the local economy.  What initiatives are being considered by the Minister and his Department?  This might be regarded as the responsibility of the Ministers with responsibility for tourism and agriculture, but I am looking at it from a job creation perspective, which is the responsibility of the Minister's Department.<\/p><p> We need to support SMEs.  Commercial rates are an issue in my own county of Waterford.  The Government is looking to move towards self-assessment, but many small and medium-sized businesses have been hit with a doubling and a trebling of their rates because of the rates revaluation.  This has caused significant problems.  It is an antiquated system of calculating rates which needs to be modernised.  The burden must be shifted from small to medium-sized businesses onto larger companies in order to give them a break.  I ask for the Minister's views on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900008#G00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373376600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

We need more communication on the very many support programmes and initiatives taken by the Department and the Government.

Various groups have attended this committee and proposed initiatives relating to grants or VAT rates which they claim would be cost-neutral in some cases.

As elected representatives, we are in Dublin three or four days a week and see the level of economic activity in the city, but then we travel to rural Ireland and it is all doom and gloom.  Many people in my part of rural Roscommon are lucky to be in work because they have migrated to the larger centres such as Dublin, Cork and Galway or else they have been forced to emigrate.  Therefore, more needs to be done for employers in rural Ireland.  The JobsPlus initiative will work, but I ask the Minister to reassure me that it will not replace any existing incentive aimed at job creation.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Michael Conaghan on community employment schemes.  There is merit in rolling out more places on community employment schemes across the country.  In the past week Castlecoote, County Roscommon won an important Tidy Towns award.  It is just a small village, but thanks to all of the community employment scheme participants, it won that award.  It is now possible to market a county such as Roscommon that was left on the hind teat, for want of a better phrase, for so many years.  Communities working together, with the help of community employment scheme participants, are able to market and sell the county as a tourism destination.  I would welcome the Minister's response on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900009#H00500","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1373376600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Conaghan for his kind comments.  I agree with him that there are two dimensions to this challenge.  It has been crucial to rebuild the export, enterprise, innovation-oriented economy.  As the Deputy rightly observed, the domestic economy has more clusters of unemployment as a result of the collapse of the construction industry which had been at the core of much of the prosperity experienced by some of these areas.  I take his point that the benefits are slow in trickling down.  However, approximately 5,000 people are working on IDA Ireland-sponsored construction sites.  IDA Ireland has had a very good year, with an extra 6,500 people at work.  The expansion in construction has had a real knock-on impact on job creation in communities.<\/p><p>  We want to see new capital expenditure projects.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is trying to find new ways of funding such projects.  A fortnight ago &euro;150 million of additional spending was approved for road, school and energy projects.  I acknowledge that people like to hear about big engineering projects, but the funding for retrofitting projects to save energy provided a return of approximately 30 jobs per &euro;1 million expended, while the return on the big capital projects is fewer than ten jobs.  In employment terms, there is more bang for our buck in some of the smaller scale projects.  <\/p><p>  I agree that digital gaming and the work of Ballyfermot College in that area present a real opportunity for us in this rapidly changing environment.<\/p> <p>We have set up a group to examine how we can position ourselves in that regard.<\/p><p> There is a great deal happening in the social enterprise area.  As we move towards a more broadly based recovery, we will begin to see the returns from the work being done by the Department of Social Protection in turning the welfare system from one which supported people who were idle -  indeed, required them to be idle to qualify for benefits - to one which places a greater emphasis on activation.  There are 90,000 opportunities between the various programmes, including JobBridge, Momentum, Springboard, community employment schemes, JobsPlus and so on.  We are developing a suite of interventions which will prove their worth as the broader economy lifts.  We are beginning to see that lift already.  Last year, 10,000 people secured employment in export-orientated companies, and 10,000 in the broader economy.<\/p><p> As I said, that wider lift is beginning to emerge, and we have to build on the momentum.  I have no objection to being held to account for our targets, but it should be noted that the overall target relates to 2016.  I never said we would have an even, straight-line graph, with 20,000 jobs created in year one, 20,000 in year two and so on. That was always going to be totally unrealistic coming off a situation where the economy was shedding 90,000 jobs per year.  It is not possible overnight to turn around a graph that is falling on such a sharp trajectory.  I see the progress we have been making as a steady turnaround.  I am not looking for plaudits for it, but the path we are on is clear and, very importantly, it is sustainable.  Clearly, there is more to do and our efforts are focused on it every day.<\/p><p> Senator David Cullinane is right to point out some of the areas of opportunity, the agriculture sector certainly being one of them.  Glanbia, for example, has nailed its colours to the mast in the Senator's region with its large investment, which will, between direct employment and gains for suppliers, support 1,600 additional jobs.  The Kerry Group has committed to a major project which will provide 900 additional jobs in the high-technology end of food production.  Those projects are all backed by my Department as part of our efforts to develop the sector.  Also in the Senator's area, Dr. Willie Donnelly is doing interesting work at Waterford Institute of Technology on smart agriculture and how it can be rolled out.  There is a real opportunity there, particularly in the south-eastern area.  There is a fight-back occurring in the region and we support that ambition.<\/p><p> The Senator also referred to property issues.  IDA Ireland has applied for planning permission in Waterford in order to position itself to provide the types of property solutions that are needed.  The grant rates are set by the European Union, but the new regional aid guidelines offer some scope for adjustment in the regional aid map.  There is work ongoing in this regard.  We have moved from the initial position where there would have been real threats to C regions which would undermine their capacity to support large companies.  We managed, by and large, to fight off that deterioration in the regional aid guidelines and are now in a position to maintain support levels.  There is, for instance, a great deal happening in the whole life sciences area, as I outlined earlier.<\/p><p> In regard to tourism, I had a chance to taste some of the tourism products on offer in the Senator's area before I left yesterday evening.  We are engaged in a range of initiatives in this area.  Microfinance is entirely new for the tourism sector, for example, as is the extension of the seed capital scheme.  There are significant supports available for tourism start-ups which were not in place 18 months ago.  It is a message we are eager to get out.<\/p><p> I have met many people who expressed concerns regarding the revaluation process that is ongoing in the Waterford area.  It comes at the same time as the amalgamation whereby new rating poundages are being set in the three local authorities.  I am acutely aware of the concerns in this regard.  The basis of any valuation, as I understand it, is always the same, namely, that it derives from an estimation of the rental value which a property would secure on an appointed day.  I understand a date in October 2011 was the day appointed in the case of Waterford.  Values have not been set there since 1988 and are clearly way out of kilter, which has resulted in both winners and losers under the revaluation scheme.  I understand the point the Senator is making.<\/p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne referred to the future of the construction industry.  As we have learned to our cost, a great deal of the success or otherwise of that sector depends on the underlying demand.  We cannot simply pump it up to a level which outstretches that underlying demand.  We are hopeful that there is some recovery of demand in certain parts of the country.  We are also building the underlying demand via new ways of funding public capital projects, as I mentioned.  In addition, some of the investment in export-oriented companies will have a construction employment return, an aspect highlighted in the recent report by Forf&aacute;s on the construction sector.  There are areas where we can continue to build.  The exporting of construction services is running to something like &euro;500 million, which is quite significant in itself.  In the case of some of the services we have developed, we are able to keep people at work through the marketing of those services overseas.  It is a difficult time for the construction sector and we must do as much as we can while ensuring projects are sustainable.  That is the message from our recent experience.<\/p><p> I am happy to accept any claim of having originated a good idea that works.  We do not show any greed over here as to the source of these ideas.  If a proposal works, we are happy to take it on board.  There are no employment grants in county enterprise boards, but there are grants for the development of a business which are totally unrelated to the grants available for start-ups.  The purpose of the develop grants is essentially to encourage people who are recruiting to take on people from the live register who are long-term unemployed.  This initiative does not conflict with the other supports to which a new start-up is entitled through the tax code or otherwise.<\/p><p> I strongly endorse the point about communities working together.  All the evidence regarding successful regional strategies suggests that they come down to the ambition of individuals who get together and seek to drive progress.  All the successful clusters begin with people who put themselves out to make things happen.  It is very important as we build our local enterprise office structures that we work with people who are willing to be leaders in their own community and build a competitive edge for their region.  All of the literature suggests that the special ingredient or secret of regional success is individuals stepping up and trying to make something work.  It is our job to support them.<\/p><p> Part of that endeavour should include a debate on what is involved in a successful regional strategy.  It is not about saying that IDA Ireland should move thousands of jobs into X or Y region; that is not how successful regions work.  Rather, it is about building off one's strengths and developing strengths where they are lacking.  We need an honest debate on what we can do to encourage a stronger regional strategy.  For the Department, it is a question of considering how our services - which are enterprise-facing services - can participate in a broader regional growth strategy which plays to our competitive strengths.  The action plan for the south east has already seen leaders emerge.  Eishtec is an extraordinary example, with three individuals working to create 550 jobs out of the ashes of something else.  They have the ambition to continue to grow that enterprise.  We need an open debate on how we can help to support those types of enterprises.<\/p> <p>This probably goes back to what Senator Feargal Quinn, who is a wily old critter at this stage, said about entrepreneurship and encouraging people to develop enterprises in their regions.  Perhaps on another occasion we might discuss how we can best position ourselves to drive successful regional growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900009#H00600","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373377800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for answering the various questions put to him.  Deputy Dara Calleary referred to the promotion of these schemes.  In fairness, the committee has teased out various ideas which did not come from the manifestos of members' individual parties.  Many have been put forward and we try to feed them into the reports we produce.  I am glad that the Minister made reference to our reports during his various contributions.  A common theme during the committee's discussions is that a common-sense approach should apply in some of the schemes.  I am not necessarily referring to the Minister's Department in that regard, but certain Departments should definitely apply a little more common sense in the qualifying criteria for schemes.  There should be a way, for example, to resolve difficulties relating to someone being obliged to wait a couple of days or even a couple of months to get on a scheme.  People generally want to return to work and sometimes the State - in the guise of Departments - can get in the way with particular rules it imposes.  I understand rules must be built into schemes when they are designed.  However, applying a little common sense when they are in operation can make all the difference.<\/p><p>  Deputy Dara Calleary also referred to the way in which schemes are advertised.  Many business groups, etc., come before the committee and it is obvious that many of the individuals to whom we speak are not aware of the existence of some schemes.  There is a need for a cross-departmental advertising campaign to get the message across to businesses on what schemes are available.  Schemes such as that which relates to family income supplement do not often seem to availed of by many businesses - either by employers or employees - because it can be difficult to access them.  However, chasing them up can be a worthwhile exercise.  There is a need to advertise these worthy schemes because the level of take-up could be better.  There is definitely a need to sell them.  This is not just a job for Departments; the various State agencies involved, the chambers of commerce, etc., must also be involved.  As the Minister knows, it is not enough just to have these schemes in place, efforts must be made to promote them.  This is an issue which is not often stressed outside this room but on which emphasis is placed at almost every meeting we hold.<\/p><p>  The fact that we have been able to discuss the Action Plan for Jobs at this meeting will be of assistance in flagging some of the initiatives relating to it.  The plan is extremely good and involves getting back to basics, laying down a roadmap for where we want to go, identifying everything that needs to be done and ticking all of the boxes.  This plan is the most important which has been produced, particularly because of the initiatives it contains.  The basics are often missed and as the Minister has often pointed out, we did not do the basics during the boom years.  That is why we are in the position in which we find ourselves.  The action plan will correct the position in that regard.  Some of the initiatives within it may seem small in nature, but they are essential and must not be forgotten over time.  I compliment the Minister on the plan.<\/p><p>  If it is acceptable to the Minister, the committee would be interested in meeting him on a regular basis in order that we might scrutinise the level of progress on the Action Plan for Jobs.  I accept that he might be put on the spot to some degree at such meetings, but that is good for everyone involved because we would all have a chance to tease out matters.  I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013070900011#K00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373377800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 3.05 p.m. and adjourned at 3.30 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 July 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht: Select Sub-Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government","time":1373373000,"counter":91},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy James Bannon, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan (Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government), Deputy Paudie Coffey, Deputy Brian Stanley.

Unfortunately, he is indisposed and cannot be present.  In his absence he has asked me to make some general comments on the Department's vote for 2013 before turning to housing expenditure, which accounts for almost 50% of the Revised Estimate.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, will then address the next largest programme - water services.<\/p><p>  The Vote for the Department for 2013 amounts to &euro;1.208 billion.  This is divided into &euro;726 million in capital spending and &euro;482 million in current spending.  There is, in addition, provision for a capital carryover of some &euro;43 million.  This will be invested as follows: housing, &euro;22 million; landfill remediation, &euro;10 million; fire services, &euro;2 million; and the Leader programme, &euro;9 million.  Furthermore, an extra &euro;10 million will be made available for energy efficiency measures in the social housing sector as part of the additional investment in infrastructure and jobs announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, recently.  The total funding of over &euro;1.2 billion will be used to make maximum progress across the range of departmental programmes.  While the Department met and exceeded specific savings targets for 2012 - more such savings are planned - it must be made clear that the story is not at all one of unremitting doom and gloom, which I am sure members will be pleased to hear.  In overall terms, the provision in the 2013 Vote - when the capital carryover is included - is &euro;1.25 billion which is a very substantial amount and close to the outturn in 2012.  Within the 2013 provision there are a number of areas which show increased resourcing.  They include housing current funding - primarily for leasing and the rental accommodation scheme; water services capital investment; landfill remediation; fire services capital; the JobStart initiative in local authorities for the long-term unemployed; and the Leader and PEACE programmes.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some specific matters.  To assist in resourcing the local government sector, the local government fund will continue to receive the proceeds of motor taxation - amounting to an estimated &euro;1.1 billion - in 2013.  The general purpose grant payment from the fund to local authorities will amount to &euro;640 million this year, an increase of some &euro;3 million on the figure for 2012.  The household charge contribution to the fund will end in 2013 and be replaced by the new local property tax.  To date, the charge has raised in excess of &euro;136 million for the local government sector.  Compliance is now at the level of 80%.  The charge has been a valuable pathfinder in the context of the local property tax.<\/p><p>  On the community side of the Revised Estimate, the Leader programme - comprising axes 3 and 4 of the rural development programme - plays a significant role in addressing employment and quality of life issues in rural areas.  The 2013 provision for the Leader programme is &euro;105 million, comprising &euro;96 million in this year's allocation and &euro;9 million carried over from 2012.  It is vital that best value is achieved from every last euro available under the current Leader programme in order that we might maximise sustainable employment opportunities in rural areas and support for business creation and development.<\/p><p>  The environment and waste management programme provides for expenditure of &euro;29 million, largely to finance the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The environment fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, will provide a further &euro;60 million to be directed towards key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention, landfill remediation and recycling.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with matters within my own area of responsibility.  The necessity to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels is impacting on all public services, including the housing programme.  However, as outlined in the Government's housing policy statement, the focus will remain on meeting the most acute needs, that is, the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  Therefore, in 2013 I have continued to focus on areas where there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and to continue to direct the available resources towards those who most require assistance from the State.  In terms of the delivery of social housing, the current economic conditions and the constraints on the availability of public finances have accelerated the restructuring of the housing programme.<\/p><p>  In 2013 the social housing capital allocation has been reduced to &euro;65 million and this will have inevitable consequences for the delivery of permanent new social housing.  Some 714 units of accommodation were delivered under the local authority programme in 2012 and, with the limited funding available, I expect that a further 300 new units will be delivered in 2013.  However, the delivery of social housing this year will also be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing.  In the context of rising need, the priority must be to maximise delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need at good value.  With the reduction in capital funding, current funding for leasing and the RAS is, therefore, central to maintaining levels of output in order to meet the increasing need for social housing.  In that context, the amount of current investment set aside for both leasing and the RAS in 2013 is &euro;180 million.  Some 1,259 new leased units were delivered in 2012 and this brought the total number of leasing units in operation to over 3,700 at the end of 2012.  The funding allocated to leasing in 2013 will, in addition to covering the cost of these existing units, also provide some 1,385 new leased units this year.  The &euro;150 million allocated to the RAS in 2013 is to cover the cost of all existing rent supplement households transferred to the scheme previous to this year - some 43,210 transfers by end 2012 - and the provision of 4,000 new rent supplement transfers in 2013.<\/p><p>  The capital assistance scheme, CAS, is the main source of new housing provision for the most vulnerable, disadvantaged households and those with specific needs.  Funding of &euro;58 million was provided for the CAS in 2012, with some 454 units of accommodation acquired or built.  The 2013 allocation for the CAS is &euro;40 million and it is anticipated that this funding will deliver 300 new units of accommodation.  A further &euro;15 million has been set aside for the capital advance leasing facility to provide a capital injection for projects involving approved housing bodies, AHBs, drawing down loan finance.<\/p><p>  The voluntary and co-operative housing sector will play an increasingly prominent role in the delivery of social housing in the coming years.  Key to that increased involvement, particularly in terms of the provision of permanent new social housing units through alternative funding models, is the need for more structured regulation of the sector.  I will, therefore, be launching a voluntary regulatory code in the coming weeks as an interim measure.  In the longer term statutory regulation supported by an autonomous and adequately resourced regulator will be needed to provide an environment within which AHBs can attract sizable external investment.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to reiterate the Government's commitment to progressing regeneration projects at a number of locations throughout the country.  The ongoing importance of the national regeneration programme cannot be underestimated, not just from a social policy perspective but also in terms of the job creation and economic renewal delivered as part of any regeneration programme.  Notwithstanding the constraints on capital expenditure across the housing programme, the national regeneration programme will continue to be supported to the fullest extent possible.  The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the root causes of disadvantage in many of our large social housing estates and flat complexes.<\/p> <p>I am determined that there will be no loss of momentum in 2013 in progressing regeneration projects in Dublin city and the other priority projects in Limerick and Cork cities and a number of regional towns around the country.  Recently, I announced allocations of &euro;80 million for regeneration projects nationally in 2013.  In these challenging times, I am pleased to be in a position to provide funding for these important projects.<\/p><p> The suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities effectively delivers across a number of priority areas.  Demand under the schemes continues to remain high, with more than 10,000 households benefiting in 2012 through funding of &euro;53.4 million.  The Exchequer funding available in 2013 is &euro;35 million, which represents a cut of almost 35% on the 2012 outturn.  In order to continue supporting independent living arrangements and to ensure that the maximum number of households continue to be supported by these grant schemes, I am reviewing the structure of the schemes.  This review will seek to achieve more with the decreasing budget.  The priority is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in the operation of the grant schemes.  It is intended that the new grant structures will apply from 2014 onwards.<\/p><p> My Department's budget in 2013 for the operation of homeless accommodation and related services is &euro;45 million, representing a small decrease on the 2012 outturn of &euro;46.5 million.  When taken together with the funding provided from housing authorities' own resources, this brings the total available funding to approximately &euro;50 million.  The maintenance of funding at approximately or in excess of &euro;50 million annually in the past five years is especially significant in the context of the difficult budgetary situation within which the Department has been operating.<\/p><p> The homelessness policy statement was published last February and advocates a housing-led approach with a target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  A set of indicators will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.<\/p><p> The allocation of resources within the overall housing Estimate for 2013 and the wider Vote reflects the difficult state of the public finances generally.  However, I will conclude by confirming that the Government is committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease, the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  I will also seek to ensure that there is maximum delivery of properties available from NAMA for social housing purposes.<\/p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will complement my remarks as regards the water services programme.  We will then deal with the matters that members wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900003#B00400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373373600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the sub-committee the water services component of the 2013 Estimate.  The Estimate demonstrates the high priority given to water services despite the financial constraints.  A provision of nearly &euro;326 million is being made available for this purpose.  Of this, over &euro;286 million is allocated to implementing the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-13.  This investment is required to expand infrastructural capacity, upgrade the water supply distribution network, tackle uneconomic levels of leakage and improve operational efficiency.<\/p><p>  Good progress is being made on implementation of the investment programme, with some 208 contracts completed and a further 77 currently under way.  Funding in 2013 will allow for some 40 to 50 additional major public water services contracts to commence and the replacement or rehabilitation of some 200 km of water mains under the water conservation programme.  The competitive tendering market assists in achieving this high level of activity.<\/p><p>  In the case of the rural water programme, the 2013 allocation is nearly &euro;40 million.  The main objective is to address drinking water quality issues in the group water sector and on smaller public schemes.<\/p><p>  Work continues apace on fundamental reform of the way water services operate.  We need to generate economies of scale in the provision of services, create a greater link between usage and funding and ensure that necessary extra infrastructural investment is secured.  The water services sector needs a new financial and operational model.  Consequently, the Government has embarked on the ambitious reform programme.  There are three essential components: the establishment of Irish Water as an independent State-owned company within Bord G&aacute;is, based on a public utility model; the introduction of a sustainable funding model to support much needed investment in the sector, which will include the introduction of water charges for domestic users; and the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services.  This function is being assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  Delivery of this programme is in line with our commitments under the EU-IMF programme of assistance and the programme for Government.<\/p><p>  Water is becoming an increasingly precious and important resource.  These reforms will guarantee security of quality supply for citizens and businesses, both now and in the future, and will increase our economic competitiveness by making Ireland an attractive location for water-intensive industries such as ICT, chemicals and agrifood.  Economic regulation will drive cost efficiencies, while environmental regulation will protect our water quality.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is working with project partners - Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann, local authorities, the CER, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others - to implement these reforms, which were outlined in the water sector reform implementation strategy, published last October.  Progress has been steady.  In March, the President signed into law the Water Services Act 2013, which provides for the establishment of Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is, the installation of meters in domestic properties and the conferring of certain powers on the CER in respect of the economic regulation of water.  Local authorities and Irish Water are conducting preparatory work ahead of Uisce &Eacute;ireann's metering programme.  Commencing later this month, this ambitious undertaking will see some 27,000 meters installed per month.  Local authority staff are currently conducting a survey of all connections to the public water supply.  The procurement processes for the metering programme are well advanced.<\/p><p>  Within Irish Water, key appointments have been made.  Dr. John Tierney has been appointed as managing director.  He has a long history in local government management and will play a key role in ensuring a smooth transition of responsibility for services from local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The reform programme partners are working on a range of reform programme work streams and progressing major projects, such as a transfer of capital projects, the development of billing capability and the introduction of a financial model for the utility.<\/p><p>  Following further comprehensive legislation planned for later this year, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will become the water services authority from 1 January 2014, responsible for providing water and wastewater services to households and businesses on the public network and for billing and collecting revenue from households when domestic water charges are introduced.  Last week, the Government approved the general scheme for the water services (No. 2) Bill, which will provide in the main for the transfer of water services functions, assets and liabilities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann; powers to allow Uisce &Eacute;ireann to levy domestic and non-domestic charges; corporate governance arrangements for Uisce &Eacute;ireann; the preparation of strategic investment plans by Uisce &Eacute;ireann; assignment of economic regulation of water services to the CER; and clarification of the role of the EPA as regards Irish Water.  The legislation will reaffirm the Government's commitment to maintaining water services assets in public ownership.  The Department will be working with the Office of the Attorney General on the preparation of the Bill, which will be published in the autumn.  This will mark a new departure for water services, creating sustainable organisational and funding models for the future and building on the skills and commitment of local authorities combined with the utility experience of Bord G&aacute;is.  Legislation will provide for local authorities to act as agents of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, providing services by way of service level agreements.<\/p><p>  Some of the next milestones in the reform programme include the commencement of the water metering programme, the publication of a second Bill in the autumn, with expected enactment by the end of the year, and consultation by the CER on various aspects of economic regulation, including the regulatory framework and the domestic tariff.  The regulator's remit will be based on protecting the customer.  The EPA will environmentally regulate the new utility.  From 1 January of next year, the newly established Irish Water Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be fully operational.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline the key elements of the considerable activity that is under way in the water sector to ensure delivery of the capital investment programme, provide for its smooth transition to Irish Water and implement the major programme of reform.  The water services sector must meet the needs of our citizens and deliver the critical infrastructure required to support economic recovery.  When the reform programme is completed, we will have put in place the necessary funding and organisational arrangements to realise those key objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900004#C00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I intend to structure the meeting based on individual programmes and as programme A, the housing programme, comprises approximately 40% of the Vote, I propose the sub-committee should discuss the housing Vote for approximately 45 minutes.

On the housing budget, while the Minister of State signalled that 300 new units would be brought on this year, there are small counties in which 300 units would only make a small dent in their housing waiting lists.  Obviously, many eggs are being put into baskets of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the social leasing scheme and the buy-out.  Has the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government undertaken long-term projections on the cost thereof?  The Department has bought into leasing for up to ten years from developers and private landlords.  While this may be fair enough as a short-term measure, the Department is doing it as a long-term measure at a cost of &euro;7,000 to &euro;9,000 per unit per annum.  This adds up to a substantial cost over a ten-year period when figures of between &euro;70,000 and &euro;90,000 are incurred.  Moreover, as the aforementioned house must be released back to its owner in pristine condition after the lease has expired, a substantial financial time bomb has been written into the contracts in the form of the bill incurred to so do.  In addition, the State and local government will miss out on ten years of rent that otherwise would be going to a local authority.  Furthermore, in the case of a house built by a local authority with funding from the Department, the State and the local authority will possess an asset at the end of the five-year tenure period.  One also should take into account the fact that the family involved has a home whereas in the case of long-term leasing or the RAS, the owner sometimes decides to sell within a couple of years and the local authority must then find another house for the tenant.<\/p><p>  I refer to when the Department draws up the balance sheet in this regard, in particular if one considers the price of purchasing or building at present.  I acknowledge the main part of the Minister of State's response will be the Government cannot do this because it does not have the cash and the capital is not available.  While this is accepted, there are ways of leveraging the capital, particularly for projects like this when an asset is involved and when rental income will be forthcoming.  Incidentally, when the sub-committee moves on to the next subject for discussion, namely, water, the Minister of State will be in a position to state how this is being done because the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will suggest that once a meter has been installed in a house, an income will be forthcoming.  Similarly, once one builds a house one will have an income therefrom.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by making the point that not unusually, one local authority is bringing in &euro;3.5 million in rent.  The good news is the cost to the local authority of maintenance of the houses concerned is between &euro;600,000 and &euro;650,000 and consequently, this activity nets almost &euro;3 million for the local authority.  What if that &euro;3 million was used to pay off a capital sum?  My question is whether the departmental officials, many of whom are present today, have undertaken a long or even a medium-term value for money audit on this measure?  It is of huge concern and the dogs on the street are barking about it.  While people are discussing this issue, I note that when members have tried to raise this issue, they do not appear to get anywhere with it.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is anxious to provide social housing and is anxious to try to squeeze what she can out of the resources available to her.  However, I believe that when the present Administration took office, this measure already had been put in place by the previous Government.  While the senior civil servants obviously will go along with it, Deputy O'Dowd and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan are the two Ministers of State with the latter having responsibility for housing.  My point is that members today have been provided with Revised Estimates that show precisely what will happen and the medium to long-term consequences must be worked through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900005#D00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>For the purpose of an efficient use of time, I might take together all the questions before the Minister of State responds, as the housing heading will be discussed for 45 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900005#D00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>This probably is one of those areas on which one probably could spend the afternoon, particularly in respect of the housing element.  There is an uneven geographical spread nationally in respect of the 100,000 people on the waiting list.  From responses to parliamentary questions from a range of sources, albeit mainly from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, I have put together my own table with regard to what are the worst and least worst local authority areas.  Anyone who is waiting for a house and who has been accepted onto a waiting list will have a need and six local authorities account for 43% of all the people on the waiting list, namely, Dublin and Cork city councils and South Dublin, Cork, Kildare and Fingal county councils.  How does the Minister of State treat the spread of the housing allocation?  While it is all very well to have a national figure of 5,000 units, is that targeted in any way or is this the intention?  At the bottom end of the housing waiting list, there are six counties that account for 3%, which tend to be local authority areas such as Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal county councils.  There is a vastly different experience, depending on where one is located in the country, and I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say with regard to a targeted approach.<\/p><p>  This spills over into the rental market because one will tend to find the areas that are most under pressure in respect of housing waiting lists also will be those areas in which there will be a profile of high rents.  Moreover, even with the welcome increase in rent caps that recently has been made by the Department of Social Protection, it still is well below market rents in some areas.  However, the Department is finding it almost impossible in some of these locations to get landlords to engage with the RAS scheme or with lending leasing schemes.  Consequently, is there a profile within the Department of the variety of situations and of the situations that are under most pressure?  Is there targeting in this regard or is it simply due to one local authority being better than another at putting in the pitch for the new builds or purchases or whatever?  Moreover, while one would like to see the construction sector back at work, has an evaluation been carried out on the value for money in purchasing as opposed to building?  There is some very good value to be had and this is certainly a buyers' market.<\/p><p>  On the subject of grants, the Minister of State referred to independent living and I am aware the Department undertook a reconfiguration last year in which some areas gained and others lost out.  While I am sure the Minister of State went through it in a methodical way on the basis of need, some local authorities simply do not provide some elements of the grants.  For example, the adaptation grants for people with disabilities are offered in my local authority area but grants are not provided for repairing homes.  For example, I recently encountered a person aged 90-something who required a few thousand euro worth of work for the roof on that person's house.  The likelihood is that a saving to the State will be made on one side because clearly, money will not be provided.  However, a cost will be incurred on the other side, in that the person in question is highly likely to end up out of that house and for someone in his or her 90s, that means one is highly likely to be in a more dependent and a more cost-inefficient environment and certainly not what that person needs.  In the review, is the Department examining inequity by insisting there is a certain element of provision, even if it is at the emergency end?  It is not good enough that it depends on a postcode lottery as to whether one receives such grants.<\/p><p>  As for the RAS and the leasing schemes, it appears to me that in some places, the local authorities have shut up shop.  It would be useful to hear back from the Minister of State as to where RAS or the leasing scheme are or are not working.<\/p> <p>I would be very surprised if the non-working end did not sit more or less beside the profile suggestive of a higher number of people on the waiting list.  <\/p><p> Homelessness was mentioned.  Is there a small reduction in the number of homeless or is the number growing?  I would have expected the budget to tackle homelessness to have been protected absolutely because it pertains to an area where people are most under stress.<\/p><p> On the value for money of the leasing scheme, somebody who was speaking to me recently and who was leaving the country on a long-term basis leased his apartment, which is worth &euro;150,000, to the local authority.  He was very grateful that the local authority took it off his hands.  Over the course of 15 years, he will end up with &euro;150,000 because of the sum accruing every year over 15 years.  The property is worth &euro;150,000 now and will be returned to him in pristine condition.  The man said it was great that the local authority is taking the apartment but said it did not seem to stack up for him.  While I acknowledge that the general Government debt has to be kept at a certain level, I believe some of the measures that apply over the longer term do not seem to stack up economically.  I would welcome the delegates' comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900005#D00400","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I wish to address the effectiveness of expenditure on homelessness.

There is a departmental policy, with which I do not agree, that one cap fits all.  There are areas of the country where one can purchase houses quite cheaply.  In the midlands, in particular, one can buy a house for one fifth of what one would pay in the larger towns and cities.  This option should be examined.  After all, local authorities have invested a lot in estate management and the reinstatement of what used to be called unfinished or ghost estates.  I do not like the term &ldquo;ghost estates&rdquo;.  Since the local authorities have already invested, they should examine the possibility of buying five or six units in a small parish rather than renting them.  It would be a lot cheaper in the long run.<\/p><p>  There is considerable competition between the local authorities and voluntary agencies, such as Respond! and Cl&uacute;id.  People are allowed to move house willy-nilly and this needs to be addressed by the Department.  A person can run down a property and then be moved to another area.  They may be a public nuisance in one estate and be moved on to another.  This needs to be addressed in the Department.<\/p><p>  With regard to grants and housing adaption grants for older people, I understand most local authorities throughout the country operate a claw-back system whereby they can redeem some of the cost if expenditure exceeds a certain figure, if the person moves on or if the house is sold.  Perhaps this should be examined.  In Longford and Westmeath, if over &euro;10,000 is spent, funding can be recouped if the house is sold or transferred to a third party.  Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900006#E00300","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Before I go to the Minister of State, I have a few points I wish to make myself.  I have written to the Minister about a street in the town of Dunmanway on which a number of houses are owned by the local authority.  One was purchased in 1999 and was never fitted out or allocated; it was knocked approximately two months ago.  Other houses became vacant as tenants moved on.  In some cases, the houses were in exceptional condition and one could literally hand the key to another tenant.  The houses have not been visited, save to survey them, since they were vacated.  This gives rise to a number of issues.  The condition of a vacant house deteriorates all the time.  Most critically, the needs of those on the housing list are not being met.  The local authority is losing out on rent that would accrue from that.<\/p><p>  Circumstances are horrific.  One house is vacant since 1998. Other houses are vacant for periods running well into double figures.  The local authority will do a survey but there is no need to do so; the houses now need to be renovated and allocated.  The practice of local authorities impinges on the efforts of tidy towns committees in various towns and urban centres through the country.  The Department needs to issue a directive to local authorities.  Trying to solve the problem locally on the ground is extremely frustrating.  The only way we will see action to prevent local authority houses from being left idle is if the action is from the top down.  The Department needs to take the lead on this.  Other members in the room could probably share similar stories, but the case I describe is particularly galling.   People need to be housed although the local authority is doing very little to renovate or make ready for allocation houses that are falling down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900006#E00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1373374800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I support the statements of the Chairman.  I raised before the length of time it takes to refurbish houses for reletting.  It is causing a serious problem.  The allocation for the housing improvement grant in the Estimate is down 23%, which is quite substantial.  That is possibly why the local authorities are not renovating the houses.  The figure for the grants is down substantially also, by 36%.  Adaptation grants for people with disabilities and the elderly are urgently needed but, unfortunately, there is a shortage in funding due to the economic realities we are experiencing.  Does Minister of State or his officials look outside the box to determine whether there are initiatives or schemes that could help to try to take people off the live register?  Only yesterday, we heard about the JobsPlus scheme, which allows private employers to take people off the live register.  I urge the Minister of State to consider having local authorities engage with skilled craftsmen and apprentices who are unemployed to link them with existing housing staff with a view to refurbishing housing stock.  The Minister of State said there is a budget for ensuring sustainability and improvements with regard to energy efficiency.  That is another area.  When considering upgrading houses to sustainable specifications and the provision of adaptation grants for the disabled, we should consider some initiative to employ unemployed craftsmen so as to make the best use of our funds.

That is the number of units delivered through the CAS.  The Deputy knows the kind of strictures on us in terms of the public finances.  For approximately &euro;7,500 a year, we can house somebody on a housing list under the leasing scheme.  I know that in the longer term there is a recurrent cost every year, but given the crisis we face as a country because we are going through very difficult times, a value for money audit was carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the cost-effectiveness of leasing and it was considered to be cost-effective.

That is a significant length of time.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to keep the matter under review and that we cannot keep on leasing more and more properties without examining the ongoing cost to the State and we will do this.  For the moment, it is considered to be a cost-effective way of housing families and we must respond to those who need housing.  Even if we were to begin a large construction programme today, we would not have houses available for a number of years.  I managed to secure &euro;10 million for this year and with the money we are going to purchase units for people with disabilities.  We are looking at different ways of acquiring units.  Leasing will continue to be a part of our programme.  Obviously, leasing from NAMA is one element and we want to ensure we take the best advantage of the available NAMA units.  This can be done either through using the voluntary sector or directly with local authorities.  I recently contacted the local authorities to ask them to specifically look for NAMA units that might be available in their areas to provide housing because we want to get the best possible social dividend from NAMA.  <\/p><p>  That brings me to the point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy because many NAMA units are in the areas about which she spoke - Kildare, Dublin and Cork - in which there is very large waiting lists.  If NAMA units are available, they should be acquired for social housing.  The Deputy gave me the statistic of 43% before.  I am very conscious of it and think we need to ensure we address the difficulties in local authority areas with the largest waiting lists.  We engage with local authorities a couple of times a year at least to ensure we discuss with them how we can target their waiting lists.  I have written to them in respect of NAMA units.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a number of other issues.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, has altered the rental caps and made them more favourable in certain areas.  <\/p><p>  On the point made by Deputies Paudie Coffey and Catherine Murphy, we are progressing in moving people in receipt of long-term rent supplement to the local authorities.  We will have another memorandum to the Cabinet soon and hope to be in a position, subject to the legislation going through, where we will be able to pilot the programme early next year and then move to a general roll-out.  It will integrate the very large cohort on rent supplement into the general social housing waiting lists.  That will be an improvement for all kinds of reasons.<\/p><p>  In respect of obtaining value for money on purchases, the extra &euro;10 million for people with disabilities will involve the direct purchase of houses.  It was suggested buying houses might be a good way to achieve value for money.  Realistically, because we are asking local authorities to come back with proposals on how they can spend the &euro;10 million this year, we expect that there will be purchases, but they will specifically be for people with disabilities.  <\/p><p>  A few members raised the issue of private grants.  We are carrying out a review and want to ensure we get the best possible value for money with the amount available.  Again, there will be a small extra amount of money available this year.  I know some people felt their particular local authority was short of money.  We will have a small extra allocation that we have managed to find this year and will be able to allocate fairly soon.  We ask local authorities to keep schemes open.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to a particularly difficult case.  We ask them to keep schemes open where there might be emergencies.  We do not want them to close them at a particular time.  While people may have been disappointed with last year's allocation, it was allocated in a very fair and transparent way and one could see exactly why certain local authorities had received the amount of money they did.  <\/p><p>  We have introduced what we call a housing-led approach to homelessness.  It is based on all of the information and research we can obtain, whereby it is much more cost-effective and better for the individual if one can get him or her into a home as quickly as possible, with the support he or she needs rather than having him or her stay long term in what is meant to be short-term urgent crisis accommodation.  We are gradually moving towards that scheme, while at the same time ensuring we have hostel accommodation available for persons who are on the streets.  There has been a small increase in the number presenting as emergency homeless, that is, people on the streets.  We are working with the various homeless fora.  There is a devolved system under which, for example, in Dublin there is a homeless forum which caters for the vast majority of homeless persons in the country.  We meet them regularly.  I have set up an oversight group consisting of three individuals whose job it is to monitor what we all do to make sure we are being effective in terms of achieving results for people who are homeless because I must ensure value for money is obtained.  I have brought up the issue of the unit referred to by Deputy Humphreys with the Dublin forum, in particular, because we want to ensure any money available spent is spent appropriately.  That does present a difficulty in the sense that where people might have been living in a hostel for two years, our aim is to get them out of that hostel as quickly as possible and in a much shorter period of time than two years and support them in their homes.<\/p> <p>We have schemes that offer supports, mainly through voluntary sector organisations such as Simon and Focus Ireland, and research shows that these are effective.<\/p><p> Deputy Kevin Humphreys also raised the issues of homelessness and Traveller accommodation.  Again, I recently met a consultative committee on the latter issue.  One of the problems with moneys allocated for the provision of Traveller accommodation is that they are not always spent in the year in which they are allocated.  Unfortunately, if the moneys are not spent in the year in which they are allocated, they cannot be rolled over, except in certain situations.  We must ensure they are spent effectively.  That is why having Travellers on these consultative committees is important to ensure we respond to their accommodation needs.<\/p><p> I do not have details for the average cost per unit of voluntary housing.  We get good value for money in working with the voluntary sector.  We will have a voluntary regulatory system for the organisations working in the area soon and we will move to a statutory regulatory system.  They have the potential to raise significant funding outside of the State&rsquo;s funding.  Some of the larger organisations are exploring various ways in which they might do this, which would help us to increase the number of units.  This will be important in addressing the needs of those on housing waiting lists.<\/p><p> Deputy James Bannon has asked if we could purchase houses in ghost estates for people with disabilities who are on local authority housing lists.  If any of them is suitable, local authority housing moneys can be used to purchase them.  On ghost estates in general, we have a national committee which has representatives of all the various interests.  It is quite complex because there are owners, receivers, bankers and so forth.  There can be a whole sector of people involved in any one ghost estate.  We are making progress in this area and want to ensure we can make improvements on individual estates.<\/p><p> Deputy James Bannon also raised the issue of clawing back housing adaptation grants.  In the review we are undertaking we are examining whether there should be a claw-back of money in cases in which a house was sold shortly after the grant money was spent on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900007#F01400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373376000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Some local authorities already operate a system in which there is a claw-back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900008#G00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1373376000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>They do in the case of mortgages.

Recently, I received a table indicating the length of time it took to reallocate in local authorities.  There are significant variations between them.  That is an issue about which we want to talk to them in more detail.  We want to know why houses in some local authorities can be left for a year before they are reallocated when the average waiting time is ten weeks in others.

In his statement the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, said it would be at the rate of 27,000 households per month.  I have asked him and the Minister the following question many times and I hope we can get an answer to it today.  How much will water metering cost and from where will the money come?  I know the Department has capital of &euro;326 million, but that is for fixing leaks.  That is a separate fund.  I have tried many times to get an answer from the Minister of State and the Minister about what the full cost per household will be.  There are reports in a newspaper today on the full cost.  Sometimes, however, reports in newspapers do not have any basis and are false.  I do not know whether this report is false.  As it is in a newspaper of record, there may be some basis for it.  What will be the full cost to the householder?  In response the Minister of State will tell me that the regulator has not yet been appointed.  If the works are so far advanced that 27,000 meters are being installed, surely he can tell me whether it is the full cost of the provision of water, which would be about &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;1.3 billion.  That would not be adding in the cost of meters per household.  Alternatively, will it be a lesser sum, possibly &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million divided among the 1.3 million householders?  Is it a total figure composed of the capital and the operational cost, which is about &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;1.3 billion, according to the Department's figures, divided by number of households?  Obviously, commercial water rates would be part of this, which, unfortunately, a huge section of the population do not pay, although they should.

How much of the capital budget will be retained or is it expected that it will be reinforced by charging people towards the capital costs of developing further infrastructure?

I am conscious that local authorities have operated their own networks on an individual basis and that the work will now be co-ordinated in the overall Irish Water network.  Is there provision for an overall co-ordinated asset management system for water networks?  One notes that approximately &euro;1 billion per annum is being invested in water networks when the level of leakage into the ground is over 50%.

It must be fair, because if it is not fair it will not work.  This must be a sharing of knowledge of facts and it must be transparent.  One must be able to query and understand all of the charges.  At the end of the day, consumers will accept it if it is fair.<\/p><p>  The big challenge for Uisce &Eacute;ireann is the ethos and the philosophy of why we are doing it, how it must work, how transparent it is, how one can query the system, how the regulator decides and how Irish Water plans.  All of those matters must be open to full scrutiny in terms of those processes.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coffey sought reassurance that Irish Water would be focused on asset management.  The assets, I understand, are to be transferred from 1 January.  He referred to mapping them, etc.  I understand there is work going on with local authorities and with the Department - and, I presume, Irish Water - in that regard.  That is a critical issue to get right.  It is also important because if Irish Water must raise funds in the international market, the company must be transparent and the full facts must be known.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900011#K00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1373377800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>As a follow-on to that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900011#K00600","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1373377800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900011#K00700","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1373377800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>-----who will approve future investment?

One is the model.  There was a reference in the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the household charge as a \"pathfinder\" in the context of the local property tax.  It was a good word and I must dig that out and use it again.  It is an ingenious use of language on the property tax.<\/p><p>  I am interested in finding out about the methodology for the allocation - if I am correct, it is 65:35 this year and 80:20 from next year.  The needs and resources model has been traditionally used.  Essentially, I make an argument that this works against developing areas, in that their needs are not established as the population grows - they become established over time - and the resources are not there to meet the needs.  I am curious as to what methodology will be used to ensure there is an equitable distribution of the money that goes into the equalisation fund.<\/p> <p> On a smaller point, in regard to the &euro;6.3 million that is going to the local authority archives service, it seems there is a very fragmented approach to the storage of a very valuable archive.  Has consideration been given to a regionalised approach or is some of that happening already?  There may well be duplication and some benefit might be gained from doing it in a more collective way.  There is very valuable information in those archives and we have to be very careful to maintain them in good condition.<\/p><p> My final point relates to the planning tribunal.  Is there an estimate of the residual planning tribunal cost that is still to come?  An amount of money is included in the Estimate but to what does this relate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900011#K02200","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373378400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>With regard to the Local Government Fund, the last speaker mentioned harmonisation and equalisation.  While I do not want to sound parochial, I come from the Waterford constituency, where three local authorities are being amalgamated - Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council - and Tramore Town Council and Lismore Town Council are being disbanded.  The Minister of State will be aware the Valuation Office carried out a revaluation of properties in that constituency, which will cause an upheaval to how the local authorities are funded, particularly given the new amalgamated status.<\/p><p>  What is happening is that the legacy system - the valuation system - will now be implemented in what is a planned system of funding local government through amalgamations and trying to create new efficiencies.  I know the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has said it is his and the Department's intention that rates should not increase.  However, quite the opposite is happening, particularly in Waterford.  It is a low rate base county, in any event, and it has traditionally depended on the Local Government Fund to keep services going.  I ask that the Minister of State would look at Waterford, perhaps as a pilot project, and then look at the wider national issue with regard to rates equalisation and harmonisation in the new scenarios, particularly under local government reform.<\/p><p>  This will become a very serious issue in terms of how services are funded and delivered.  With the implementation of the property tax in particular, people are going to demand more accountability from local authorities and the Department as to how their euros are spent, rightly so.  We need to look closely at how we will align local government funding with future demands and with the new structures that are being proposed in regard to the property tax, water rates and all of that.  I would welcome feedback from the Minister of State or the officials on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900012#L00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1373378400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>With the reductions planned for local authorities from the next elections, the major consideration is the lack of funding for many local authority projects.  Having served on local authorities over the years, I know that lack of adequate funding was always the main complaint.<\/p><p>  To follow on from Deputy Coffey's point, only this morning I had a meeting with Leitrim County Council in regard to rates issues.  Most businesses are struggling at present and the biggest initial investment each year is the cost of the rates.  My meeting with officials of Leitrim County Council this morning concerned what could be done on behalf of one business, and I want to know whether there is any form of appeals process.  This business person has appealed on two or three occasions, and each time the rateable value of the business has gone up.  The business is in a small village with a population of a couple of hundred.  This man is trying to survive and rear a young family, but no consideration whatsoever is given by the people carrying out the valuations, who are not engaging in any way.  Are these people untouchable or can they be touched?  I raised this issue last week with the Minister in regard to new legislation.  These people should be made accountable.  An inspector recently gave the impression that the Valuation Office has great sympathy for business, but when the valuation came back up from the country, the official in charge decided it would be at the same level as previously.<\/p><p>  Members will know that small businesses, which are the lifeblood of this country, are closing daily because people cannot pay the rates.

On local government funding and the property tax, an interdepartmental group is examining the various issues in detail at present.  Obviously, a model will have to be worked out in regard to how the 80:20 allocation is administered and how the entire Local Government Fund is administered.  The interdepartmental group will be bringing forward proposals in the context of budget 2014.  That work has not yet been completed but, obviously, there are different issues in different parts of the country.  The fact is we need appropriate recalibration to ensure all of the issues are dealt with, and that work is ongoing at present.  The figure of 80:20 has been reached in terms of the amount that is retained and then goes into the general fund.<\/p><p>  Deputies Catherine Murphy, Tony McLoughlin and Paudie Coffey raised issues around valuation, equalisation and so on.  I will deal with those issues first before I go back to Deputy Murphy's more specific questions.  On the specific issue of Waterford, I know the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is very conscious of the various local authorities that are being amalgamated and also those that will be subsumed under the new local government proposals.  I have some experience of this because there is already an ongoing process whereby Limerick city and county are being brought together.  There was an issue with the Limerick county rate being lower than the Limerick city rate, and a gradual process is underway to bring them closer together.  The intention is to do something similar in Waterford.  The Minister is aware of the concerns of local business people in the different authority areas, so this will be strongly borne in mind.<\/p><p>  The valuation process, to which Deputy Coffey referred, adds another layer of complication to the issue.  To address the concerns of Deputy McLoughlin, the valuation is an independent process, for very good reason.  I know the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and his officials are very conscious of the need to ensure there are not undue costs on businesses generally around the country, because businesses are struggling due to the current economic situation.  It is an ongoing process in Waterford and there is a timeframe during which all of these changes will take place.  We are very conscious of the issues, and communication will be continued with regard to the implications.<\/p><p>  On the other issues raised by Deputy Murphy, as she said, there is &euro;6.3 million for the archives service.  There are already some measures in place with regard to the sharing of work - for example, there are joint archivists who are shared among local authorities.<\/p> <p>Regarding interaction between libraries, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, has a library unit to provide centralised supports to local authorities.<\/p><p> In all areas of local government, we are trying to find ways to share experience, services and efficiencies in terms of procurement, etc.  There is more of a coming together than there was previously.  This also applies in respect of archive services, which are valuable to the public, as has been rightly stated.<\/p><p> The notional figure in the current Vote for the Mahon tribunal is &euro;2 million.  We have needed to estimate how much will be required.  The 2012 estimate for the tribunal's overall cost was &euro;196 million.  Of that, &euro;101 million has already been paid by the Department, leaving some &euro;95 million due in third party costs.  The timing depends on when bills are submitted.  People with bills are being urged to submit them as quickly as possible.  It has been agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the costs will be met centrally, but we must propose a notional figure on the amount that we expect to be spent this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900012#L00400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373379000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Does that account for all legal fees or do some remain to be determined in light of whether people co-operated, etc.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900013#M00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1373379000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>It is as much as we can estimate in accordance with our current information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12013070900013#M00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1373379000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

I acknowledge that it needs to be independent, but it is working in an inherited system that is not fit for purpose, given the current economic reality.  The Government is doing good work by creating efficiencies in local government and how services are delivered.  We have broadened the tax base through the introduction of the property tax, in return for which people rightly expect the delivery of services, and water charges.  We have proposed a new sustainable system, yet the valuation system is dated and is still working to the older model.  Waterford's problem with this, particularly given the amalgamation and the issue of rates equalisation and harmonisation, is that the rates for the large multinationals in my constituency have decreased despite their being able to pay rates.  Small shops and retailers in small villages, towns and the city centre have seen their rates increase by 300%.  This cannot work.  I am asking the Minister of State in the presence of her senior officials to examine this issue closely.  It is happening in my constituency now, but it will happen across the country as the rates valuation process gets under way.

My Department also promotes the Irish language, supports the Gaeltacht and assists the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of almost &euro;255 million is available to my Department for these purposes in 2013, with a further &euro;8 million allocated to the National Gallery of Ireland Vote. <\/p><p>  Between 2008 and 2013 the overall programme expenditure provision, excluding departmental administration for my Department's four programme areas increased by more than &euro;262 million or 54%.  In broad terms, the 2013 allocations to my Vote group are as follows: some &euro;133 million for arts, culture and film, including almost &euro;61 million for the Arts Council; some &euro;47 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage; almost &euro;42 million for the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands and over &euro;40 million for North-South Co-Operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies - Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga. <\/p><p>  As members will appreciate, a consequence of the significant fiscal deficit facing the country is that we just have not had the resources available to fund all the services that we would like to provide.

In that context, I continue to place emphasis on supporting jobs in the audiovisual and wider arts sectors and in the Gaeltacht; investment in the culture and heritage sectors that will support cultural tourism as one of the most important elements of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product; complying with EU Directives, including investment in alternative solutions for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in special areas of conservation and supporting the built heritage, the strategic development of our national parks and the development of our waterways in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements. <\/p><p>  I propose now to provide some further detail and my ministerial colleague, Deputy Dinny McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish Language and Islands programmes.  Some &euro;133 million has been allocated to the arts, culture and film subheads, including the National Gallery of Ireland for 2013.  This funding makes an important contribution to protecting jobs and stimulating creativity across the country.  Ireland's cultural and creative industries also play a major role in defining a positive image for Ireland abroad. <\/p><p>  My Department continues to place emphasis on front line services, as well as on prioritising supports to artists.  For example, the priority for the national cultural institutions in 2013 is to keep venues open and to maintain services to the public as far as possible.  This is to ensure that these institutions can continue to attract large numbers of people, including overseas and domestic tourists. <\/p><p>  In relation to film making activities, I was very pleased that the Minister for Finance in his 2013 Budget Statement confirmed that he was extending the film tax relief scheme, section 481, until the end of 2020.  This is a major vote of confidence in the audiovisual production sector by the Government and will assist in giving the sector continuity and certainty for the future and allow projects to proceed in the knowledge that this important underpinning of the industry will be there for the next seven years.  In 2012 it sustained 7,500 jobs, reflecting an aggregate investment of some &euro;260 million.<\/p> <p>The largest single portion of capital funding for the arts will be channelled through the Irish Film Board, in recognition of its importance from a cultural and employment perspective.  One of the key reasons Ireland continues to be chosen as a film location is the work the board does to promote Ireland in international film and television markets.  The positive impact of this work is that it creates jobs in Ireland, leads to spending on local goods and services and promotes Ireland on the big and small screen to audiences of millions internationally.  Given the significant investment in arts infrastructure in recent years, there is now a focus on ensuring resources are made available to support the operation of these facilities.  Nevertheless, a small number of significant capital projects will continue to be supported this year, including the Solas cinema project in Galway, the Garage Theatre in Monaghan and the St. John's Square project in Limerick city.<\/p><p> The valuable work of the Arts Council in supporting the intrinsic cultural, tourism and economic value of the arts throughout the country has been recognised.  This is reflected in the 2013 current allocation of almost &euro;61 million.  While this is a reduction of 4% on last year's provision, it will allow the council to continue to support arts organisations of varying sizes, from national bodies such as the Abbey Theatre to small local groups across a very broad range of individual art forms and practices.<\/p><p> In April my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and I announced a further extension to the successful JobBridge national internship scheme which will provide for new internships in the arts sector.  In association with the Arts Council, the new strand will provide exciting opportunities for those interested in careers in the arts.  It will allow them to gain hands-on experience and enrich their skills.  It will foster emerging talent in the arts and support local arts groups in theatre, film, visual arts, dance, music, literature and other areas of the arts.<\/p><p> Almost &euro;8 million is provided for the Vote of the National Gallery of Ireland, in addition to the &euro;125.5 million in funding provided for the arts, culture and film sector by my Department.  In 2013 the gallery will continue to focus on delivering the best service possible within the resources available.  Earlier this year I announced that additional resources of &euro;10 million would be made available across 2014 and 2015 to facilitate the refurbishment of the historic Dargan and Milltown wings.  Preliminary work in this regard will commence later in 2013.<\/p><p> I wish to speak about the heritage programme area.  My Department remains committed to the conservation and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage for the enjoyment of present and future generations and national and international visitors.  A provision of &euro;47 million has been made available in this regard.  A further &euro;1.2 million in funding has been carried over from the 2012 capital provision.  Following a critical review in 2012 under the public service reform programme, the funding provided for the Heritage Council in 2013 will support the council in facilitating the grant-aiding of heritage projects from various sources and engaging with and supporting local government and communities in capacity building and support.  While the scope to provide resources for the protection of the built heritage is constrained by the current contraction in the public finances, my Department will continue to provide funding for conservation works to heritage properties and national monuments in State care.  In addition, the structures at risk fund which was established in 2011 to assist with works to safeguard structures in private and civic ownership that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts will continue in 2013, with an allocation of &euro;475,000.<\/p><p> My Department is helping to increase the awareness of our rich heritage among international visitors and citizens.  It is doing this by maintaining close links with local government, the Office of Public Works, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council, by participating in major events such as the ploughing championships and by establishing a presence online through the development of its website and new social media channels.  I am particularly hopeful the historic towns pilot initiative which is being funded by my Department in 2013, with an allocation of &euro;240,000, will contribute to the heritage-led regeneration of three of Ireland&rsquo;s historic towns - Westport, Listowel and Youghal.<\/p><p> The key national heritage outputs in 2013 will focus on the maintenance, development, management and operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This includes meeting the running costs of the six national parks and 78 nature reserves, undertaking development and improvement works to visitor facilities, funding conservation-related scientific surveys and reporting to meet obligations under EU directives.  The dispersed locations of national parks and nature reserves mean that they bring significant economic and employment opportunities to rural communities.  Despite the current economic challenges, I intend to invest in visitor facilities in these parks and reserves to maximise their sustainable use and contribution to national economic recovery.  It is estimated that there are approximately 3 million visitors to NPWS properties each year.  They play an increasingly significant role in increasing Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a tourism destination and investment location.<\/p><p> Turf-cutting and the protection of designated raised bogs continues to be a key concern.  I remain determined to address the turf-cutting issue in a way that is fair, balanced and supportive of those affected.  The compensation package approved by the Government as part of a special effort to resolve the turf-cutting issue and avoid the imposition on Ireland of major fines by the European Court of Justice will continue to be a major priority within the 2013 capital provision.  Therefore, I have ensured funding towards achieving a resolution of this difficult issue has been allocated from my Department&rsquo;s Voted expenditure and the environment fund for a redress package for those affected.  Some &euro;6.55 million will be made available for turf-cutting issues in 2013 between the Vote of my Department and the environment fund.<\/p><p> Just under &euro;42 million has been allocated to the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands in 2013.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of these areas in his statement to the committee.<\/p><p> A provision of almost over &euro;40 million is available this year to support the two North-South Implementation Bodies within my Department's ambit - Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga which comprises Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency.  The Minister of State will speak shortly about An Foras Teanga.  Waterways Ireland which is responsible for the inland navigable waterway system receives 85% of its funding from the State and 15% from Northern Ireland.  A provision of over &euro;25 million is being made available from my Department this year.  Members will be aware that funding for these bodies is provided by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in accordance with budgets approved by the North-South Ministerial Council.  The 2013 budget is indicative only.  It is subject to ongoing discussion with the co-sponsoring Department in Northern Ireland and the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council in due course.<\/p><p> I would like to refer briefly to two areas of significance within my Department's ambit - the EU Presidency and the decade of commemorations.  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union offered a new platform for cultural links with our key European partners.  I oversaw the accompanying cultural programme which represented an important opportunity to showcase Ireland&rsquo;s cultural heritage and artistic talent and to win positive publicity for Irish creativity on the European stage and further afield.  Audience attendance has been strong, while feedback and media coverage have been very positive.  In Berlin there were more than 1,200 attendees at the opening concert by the Gloaming.  Visitor numbers to the \"Changing States\" art exhibition in Brussels have exceeded 8,000.  The Centre Pompidou in Paris will attract approximately 500,000 visitors during the Eileen Gray exhibition.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware of a number of very important commemorations in the coming period.  The decade from 1912 to 1922 was one of considerable economic, political and social change, not just in Ireland but in Europe and globally.  I am proud to serve as chairman of the all-party Oireachtas consultation group on centenary commemorations which is dealing with the commemorative programme for the decade of centenaries.  The programme will respect the various traditions on the island in a way that is sensitive, fair and reflective of our growth as a people of shared, disparate and, sometimes, conflicting interests, heritage and culture.  I look forward to working with partners in both the North-South and east-west contexts as the various commemorative events take place in the years ahead.  <\/p><p> I will be happy to expand on any matter Deputies may wish to raise after the Minister of State has made his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900002#A00500","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373385600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm Meastach&aacute;in 2013 sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n do mo Roinn a chur i l&aacute;thair an chomhchoiste seo.

The Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, set out the real challenge facing the Government in meeting the required level of public expenditure in the current climate.  It is a particularly tall order.  We realise how major that challenge is and commend the Minister and his Minister of State for the efforts they are making, at least, to some extent.<\/p><p>  Important work is being done by the Arts Council and its allocation of something over &euro;60 million is significant.  This year's allocation is down by 4% compared with a figure of 3.2% last year.<\/p> <p>One wonders, when we are told the climate is generally improving and that the cuts this year are to be less excessive than last year, why it is that we are seeing such a significant cut in the money being made available to the Arts Council.  We know the Arts Council funds local arts centres across the country, and we know those centres are very effective at bringing art into the local community.  What we do not know, and Minister may be in a position to address this, is the extent to which governance of those centres has been looked at by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or, indeed, by the Arts Council.<\/p><p> The Minister and I have exchanged comments about, say, the Belltable in Limerick in recent times, following its closure.  However, the closure of the Belltable, which was regarded as one of the more successful centres in the country, raises questions about the financial management systems that are in place in other arts centres.  It is in everybody's interest that the systems and governance would be beyond question and that the financial management would be astute and effective in the current climate.  The Minister might comment on that and he might also indicate how the Department works with the Arts Council to ensure there is an even distribution across the country, having regard to population and so on, of the moneys that are available.<\/p><p> With regard to the Irish Film Board and the work being done in that area, I salute the Minister for Finance for what he has done in extending the tax relief to 2020.  In recent years there has been much harmful speculation as to whether the relief was going to be ended.  This removes all of that and we have certainty in place until 2020.  That is good for the audiovisual sector, which is highly productive.  Is the Minister in a position to indicate what level of direct funding he is in a position to make available, and what funding he has made available in recent years, to production companies for the production of films in this country?  Can he point to a film and tell us that the Irish State subvented it to the tune of, say, &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or otherwise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900004#C00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373386800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Ministers and their officials.

Will the Minister explain how much Comhaltas will receive in 2013 and what other bodies are funded through this measure?  He might also outline to the committee what are the criteria to receive and qualify for funding under that measure?<\/p><p>  Subhead A3 concerns the acquisition of works for the State to enhance the national collection.  Is the Minister aware of any art pieces that the banks, particularly the covered institutions owned by the State, might care to donate to the State?  Is he aware specifically of any pieces that might be in the ownership of IBRC, for example, in its Treasury Room, which may be of interest to the State and to the Minister in terms of the public's enjoyment of the art, given we effectively own some of the covered institutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900005#D00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1373386800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, on their work during the Irish EU Presidency.  One of the things that came very much to the fore was the promotion of the arts, whether it was Irish music, song or dance.  We often show the best features of Irish culture when we have visitors, whether they are visitors from Europe or visitors such as the Queen, President Obama or the Kennedy family, who were with us recently.  There were some excellent performances and I would suggest the music, song and dance were probably better than some of the speeches.<\/p><p>  I want to raise with the Minister the issue of the Solas cinema project in Galway, which is promoted by Ms Leila Doolin.  There was great co-operation with the city council in Galway and though the attempt to get funding together was difficult, I understand the project is going ahead.<\/p><p>  Representatives of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann appeared previously at the committee, among other Irish music contributors.  They made the point that there was an issue with funding.  I raised the point that much of the funding has been reduced, whether that is local authority or VEC funding.  The arts bodies in the local authorities often assume that Comhaltas is getting money from the State but it is unfair to Comhaltas to expect it to continue with the kind of funding it is getting.  Given that every county has a fleadh, every province has a provincial fleadh and there is an all-Ireland fleadh, and given the great culture brought to places like Cavan and Derry in recent times, it is important that this funding to Comhaltas would continue.  I would be interested to know why there is a difference in funding for 2012 and 2013.  We must bear in mind there have been reductions at local authority level and even in the small discretionary grants made by VECs and others bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900005#D00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1373386800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers for their presentations.

I am a member of that commemorative committee.  We are getting the most fantastic submissions and we meet relatively regularly.  It is an incredibly important ten years ahead.  I would have thought that, in terms of lifting the population and engaging people both at local and national level, we should be seeing that reflected.  There was no mention in the Estimate of an amount of money.  As I know many things will be funded, I would like to hear the Minister's view in regard to what is likely to happen in the next year.<\/p> <p> On the areas that are self-funding, sometimes it is the ones that are not included about which one would ask a question.  For example, the role of the chief herald has to be filled from within the National Library of Ireland, yet from what I can see that is likely to be a self-financing post.  It strikes me that the embargo should be relaxed for that because it produces a return.<\/p><p> I looked through the Estimates to see if there was an increase in the amount of money available to upgrade technology, for example.  I compliment the Department on the work it has done on its website in terms of the linkages to different sets of records, but there is a good deal of out-of-date technology in the National Archives of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.  It must be quite costly just to maintain microfilm machines and so on but it strikes me there should be some initiative to upgrade the technology to digitise or computerise it, which would be better value for money.  The fact that it is not included in the Estimates raises a question.  When the 1911 census went live it had 4.5 million \"hits\" in the first 48 hours.  There are real opportunities in this, and some of the areas can be self-funding.  We can charge for services, for example.  We pay for services already.  We pay to get a certificate.  The indexes for births, marriages and deaths recently transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but the actual records should go live, as they are due to do in Northern Ireland.  There is an income to be gained from that.  There is a real interest in this, and there is not any resistance on the part of people in terms of paying for the record.  They pay for that record already and I do not understand the reason that is not being considered from the point of view of the positive contribution it can make, whether it is this Department or another Department.  I would favour it being under the remit of one Department as a one-stop shop, but I am interested to hear if any analysis has been done on any potential income that might be raised from that source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900005#D00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373387400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the range of questions they have asked, all of which are relevant.  I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's questions.  As regards the Arts Council funding, the reduction in Arts Council funding was not commensurate with funding in other areas.  I deliberately protected the Arts Council funding because of its important contribution to the rest of the country.  There is a very good production by the Arts Council which shows the level of grant in 2012 and also the distribution of those grants across the country.  I would strongly advise people to look at that because it shows the regional distribution and also the recipients of the grant.  Having been involved in organisations that benefited from Arts Council grants in the past I appreciate their relevance and the fact that without Arts Council funding there is no doubt that organisations would go out of existence.  For those reasons I deliberately supported additional funding for the Arts Council last year that was not commensurate with the reductions in other areas.  Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l will see that reductions in the past two years were considerably less than those in the previous years.  That was a deliberate policy on my part.<\/p><p>  As regards the governance of centres, we discussed that previously and the Deputy raised it in the D&aacute;il.  I agree with him.  My officials, having responded to what the Deputy said, are examining ways to bring in, along with the Arts Council, the main recipients of Arts Council funding, especially the centres throughout the country, to examine their governance and determine whether we can provide them with a more sustainable approach.  We can also advise them on programme and staffing arrangements and how they can use schemes such as JobBridge to ensure their survival and sustainability for the future.  That will happen.  I will let the Deputy know when it is on, and he or any other member is welcome to attend.<\/p><p>  Regarding the film industry, it is similar to the Arts Council in that I give the money to the Arts Council and the Arts Council spends it.  That is the way it should be.  It is at arms length from me and I cannot influence it in any way.  In that sense, I may have had more influence with the Arts Council before I became a Minister than now, because I cannot even make a recommendation.  That is the way it should be.  That is the arms-length approach that we copper-fastened in this committee room some time ago when the 2003 Bill was being debated.  It is the same principle with regard to the Irish Film Board.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the number of productions that were helped over the line because of section 481 and funding from the Film Board also.  Projects such as \"The Vikings\", a television drama series, realised approximately &euro;23.5 million.  The series was received very well in America and it is back again for a further series.  \"Ripper Street\" yielded &euro;11 million for Ireland.  It was supported by the Irish Film Board and by section 481.  The production is back in Ireland, having completed last year's series.  Another series, \"Quirke\", was very successful also.  It had a smaller budget of &euro;7.3 million overall but was still very successful.<\/p><p>  The animation industry is thriving and what is happening in it is very exciting.  For example, an investment of &euro;6.6 million was made in series three of \"Roy\", which has been very well received.  Also, films such as \"The Guard\", which was very successful, would not have been made but for support from section 481 and also from the Irish Film Board.  <\/p><p>  The film board has been quite successful despite the fact that it is on reduced funding.  It probably finds it difficult to compete with Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland can put up more capital funding.  That was demonstrated by the fact that Northern Ireland won the Dracula project over us despite the fact that there would have been a desire to make it here.  At the same time, with the limited funding available to us, we are funding some very good films.  One example of a very small film that was made in my part of Ireland was \"Pilgrim Hill\", which was about rural isolation.  It was made for &euro;5,000.  It got additional development funding from the film board of approximately &euro;10,000 and it has realised a considerable amount of money at the box office.  It has done very well and has outperformed films that probably had investments of &euro;1 million.  The film board is supporting smaller productions also, which is only right.<\/p><p>  We are working closely with Limerick City Council towards resolving the problem with the Belltable.  I hope we will get a resolution because the Belltable will be very important in Limerick next year when it will be the City of Culture.  It would be ironic if one of the City of Culture's prime attractions remained closed.  There are other issues with the Belltable of which members may be aware.  For example, there is a noise issue, but it is hoped those matters can be resolved.<\/p><p>  Deputy Nash asked a number of questions, including a particular reference to the outturn in 2012 compared to the increase in 2013 under subhead A2, non-pay costs.  Actually, the provision for non-pay costs in 2013 is less than the allocation in 2012.  I expect to find savings again in 2013, and therefore I expect that the outturn in 2013 will not be higher than the 2012 outturn.  In other words, savings were made.<\/p> <p>This year's provision was less than last year's provision but the outturn was lower.  We hope to make further savings this year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900006#E00200","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373388000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>What kind of projects are involved under Vote 34, subhead A2, non-pay items?

Deputy Nash asked about subhead A7 and the contribution to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  The contribution this year will be &euro;1.59 million which is a reduction of 5% on last year.  I recognise that Comhaltas is one of the most important cultural bodies in the country and it yields a considerable return for the investment made.  The Fleadh Cheoil is the biggest outdoor event in the country attracting massive numbers which will increase in this very important year as Derry is the European city of culture and the fleadh will attract 300,000 people if not more.  Comhaltas operates in every community in the country, including my own community.  We set up a Comhaltas branch a few years ago and there are now 60 young children playing music who would not have played only for the presence of Comhaltas.  It also operates a programme in the local primary school whereby every youngster from second class upwards can play an instrument while some children in sixth class can play five instruments.  This would not have happened without Comhaltas.  I have no problem defending the allocation I make to Comhaltas because of its contribution to Irish society, communities and all the volunteer work these people take on for the love of Irish music, song and dance.  It is money which returns a significant multiplier.<\/p><p>  I refer to important pieces of art held by the main banks-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900007#F00300","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1373388000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>If I may intervene, I asked the Minister what other bodies are funded under subhead A7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900007#F00400","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1373388000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>For example, Music Network, NAPD, National Association for Principals and Deputy Principals, Other Voices, which is Philip King's project.  We had a very successful philanthropy scheme last year.  The programme for Government gave a commitment to promote philanthropy as much as possible in order to make up for the shortfall in funds.  A pilot scheme was introduced last year with &euro;210,000 which yielded almost &euro;1 million.  This was a strict evaluation for the arts community.  It encouraged people to start looking beyond the Arts Council or the local authority for funding and to instead connect with the business community and to identify people who would be well-disposed towards funding the arts.  That philanthropy scheme was successfully funded under subhead A7 and it worked very well overall.<\/p><p>  I refer to paintings and other artistic objects held by the banks and which could or should come into public ownership.  For example, AIB provided 39 very important and iconic pieces.

I am trying to encourage other companies and businesses to do something similar by supporting artists and buying pieces from them and there has been a response to that request.  They are buying pieces from emerging artists as well as from the big names.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kitt mentioned the cultural programme which was very well received.  An investment of approximately &euro;3 million funded 400 events in Ireland and all over Europe.  A major event was held in Berlin which was attended by 1,200 people and received rave reviews.  I attended the opening event of the cultural programme which featured The Gloaming.  People were spellbound by the music of The Gloaming, Martin Hayes and Iarla &Oacute; Lion&aacute;ird.  This was a European audience but they were very impressed with the quality of the Irish music and the sean n&oacute;s singing.  Half a million people went to the Eileen Gray exhibition in Paris and there was also great interest in the Francis Bacon exhibition in the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux Arts which I opened.  I thank the artists and Culture Ireland, Christine Sisk and all her staff, for organising a very good cultural programme in what are challenging circumstances.  The artists benefited from the programme and also the country benefited.  The funding of &euro;3 million was a considerable reduction from the funding levels of 2004 but we got very good value for our investment.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kitt referred to Solas in Galway. This is proceeding in stages.  There is an issue with local funding.  I have been in discussion with the local promoters.  It is hoped the matter will be resolved in time but there will need to be more of a contribution from the city of Galway because this project costs &euro;8 million and the city will be the main beneficiary.  Deputy Sandra McLellan referred to subhead A7 and to capital expenditure in that area.  Places such as the Athlone art gallery benefited to the tune of &euro;500,000; Dublin City Council artists' studios; the Garage Theatre received over &euro;500,000 last year.  Some funding has been allocated for this year, including to Na P&iacute;obair&iacute; Uileann.  I can provide the Deputy with a list of our contributions.  The art and architecture of Ireland project received &euro;100,000.<\/p> <p>The Theatre Royal in Wexford was allocated &euro;30,000.  It is an extensive list, all of which, in my view, represent money well spent.  They are important and sustainable projects.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about the commemorations programme, in which I am aware she has a great personal interest.  It is fair to say that the decade has been marked very comprehensively to date.  The failure by large sections of the media to give coverage to those commemorations is a separate issue.  We had several events to mark the anniversary of the passing of the Home Rule Bill, in Iveagh House, the House of Commons and Waterford City Library.  That issue did receive some coverage; <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, for instance, produced a special supplement on the Home Rule Bill and RTE broadcast a number of relevant programmes.<\/p><p> It is probably true to say that people are more interested in the present than in the past.  However, our efforts in this regard are continuing.  We are promoting the commemorations programme through the website, Century Ireland, which had received, at last count, more than 100,000 hits.  I do not have the up-to-date figure, but it has been a great success in a short space of time.  If one wants to know what happened 100 years ago this week, the website will link to articles in various newspapers and to commentaries by recognised historians.  It is a very useful resource.<\/p><p> As the Deputy knows, several important anniversaries are fast approaching.  In the case of the Dublin Lock-out, for example, there has been a great deal of preparation in conjunction with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which has included restoration of tenement buildings in Henrietta Street.  We also have plans to commemorate the establishment of Cumann na mBan next April and, this coming November, of the Irish Volunteers.  I am confident we will commemorate these events properly.  There will obviously be a major build-up to 1916.  The anniversary of the Easter Rising will be very much a flagship commemoration, with a focus not only on the military event itself, but also the whole cultural movement which inspired that event.  Preparations are already under way in this regard.  The Department has facilitated interviews - more than 60 thus far - with the descendants of participants in the Rising, which are very revealing.  Very few children of those people are still alive, but we have spoken to grandchildren and other family members.  We intend to bring all the families together in Dublin Castle in November.  Some of the participants in 1916 went their separate ways following the unfortunate split in 1923, but they were all together in the GPO.  It is very important that everybody feels part of the commemorations, which is something that can easily be achieved with good will on everybody's side.  The Dublin Castle event will be the launching pad for our programme of 1916 commemorations, and members of the 2016 Oireachtas Commemoration Committee will be invited to attend.<\/p><p> Deputy Murphy also asked about efforts in the area of digitisation.  As she is probably aware, work is under way on the letters from the leaders of 1916 to family members.  Dr. Susan Schreibman, a foremost digital expert based in Trinity College, presented a proposal to the Department in this regard and we have agreed to provide the modest funding.  It is one of several digitisation projects happening at this time.  The Deputy's query regarding the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland will be addressed in legislation I present in the autumn session.  We hope to begin preparatory work very shortly on the digitisation of the 1926 census.  The difficulty is that there are legal issues regarding the publication of those data, if not for which we would have made more progress.  The Central Statistics Office has concerns regarding the implications for census-taking in the present if the data are published.  That creates a problem but does not prevent us from taking down the boxes and having the documents digitised.  We hope to start the process very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900007#F00700","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373388600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Given the absence, for a variety of reasons, of census data from the 19th century, a reliable census substitute becomes very important.  The key resource in this regard is the register of births, marriages and deaths which, although not comprehensive, provides a great deal of information from 1864 onwards.  The last Social Welfare Bill provided for the transfer of the indexes, and I understand they are already online on the website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  Has there been any progress in making the actual records available?  In Northern Ireland, for instance, the records, which are held at Chichester Street in Belfast, are going online by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  The hit rate for the Century Ireland website and the 1901 and 1911 censuses shows there is a huge opportunity and a very decent income to be made from transferring the historical records online.  We might follow the example of Britain where a threshold of 100 years was chosen for births, 75 years for marriages and 50 years for deaths.  Making those records available as a type of census substitute for the 30 or 40 years in question would be a game changer from a genealogy perspective.  I do not understand why there has not been a rush to do it, particularly when a great deal of the work has already been undertaken over several years in Roscommon.

I commend the Minister on what is being done by his Department in Westport, Listowel and Youghal.  It does, however, raise questions about the network of heritage towns across the country and the level of financial aid the Department is in a position to provide.<\/p> <p>In the context of the funding that is available, has an assessment been carried out in respect of discovering how effective has been the designation of many of these towns?  In my constituency, for example, there are two heritage towns.  If one were to poll people on the streets of Kildare, they would say that its inclusion under the heritage towns initiative was a positive.  However, if one were to poll those in Athy - which is also a heritage town - I am of the view that one would obtain the opposite reaction.  One wonders how we can ensure - in the context of the availability of funding and through the use of the Minister's good offices and those of his Department - that more of the type of work being undertaken in Westport, Listowel and Youghal can be carried out at other locations throughout the country.<\/p><p> During the years of the Celtic tiger - and also in the preceding decades - there was considerable investment in the great houses of Ireland.  However, I am concerned about the huge deterioration of thatched cottages throughout the country.  When people come to Ireland - particularly those who have not visited for many years - and travel through the countryside, they are taken aback by the \"bungalow bliss\" with which they are confronted and also by the very impressive nature of some modern houses.  Increasingly, however, we are losing our stock of thatched cottages.  We will very much regret their passing when they are gone.  I accept that there are practical difficulties involved.  For example, the cost of thatching and that which relates to insurance are both prohibitive.  In the past five to six years in particular there has been a dreadful decline in the number of thatched cottages.  There is a need for active engagement on this matter and the Heritage Council, the Minister's Department and local authorities must develop innovative ways of ensuring the preservation of the properties to which I refer.  As the advertisement says, \"When they're gone, they're gone\".  When our thatched cottages disappear, they can never be replaced.<\/p><p> The Department is to be commended on the work it is doing through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  One continually hears positive reports about this work from people throughout the country.  I acknowledge that the Minister has minimised the cut in respect of the National Parks and Wildlife Service but will he indicate the level of funding that is available to it?  Good work has been done with regard to preserving endangered species.  The entire country became engaged in a story relating to the fate of our golden eagles a few years ago.  People watched with fascination in order to discover what would happen in the context of the preservation of those magnificent birds.  They became angry when it was discovered farmers or other individuals had poisoned or shot some of them.  There are other species, such as the red squirrel and the red deer - the latter may not be endangered but the sika deer has come to dominate in some parts of the country - about which I am concerned.  In the context of the Revised Estimates before the committee, what level of funding is available for the National Parks and Wildlife Service to allow it to address the matters to which I refer and to continue the very good work it has been doing?<\/p><p> Waterways Ireland is a North-South body which is doing very positive work.  As one traverses the country, one can see the benefits of the investment that is taking place.  As a result of the awfully inclement weather in recent years, particular problems have arisen in various parts of the country with regard to river maintenance, particularly in the context of weirs.  I am aware of cases where the Inland Fisheries Board - which is charged with protecting and increasing fish stocks - became concerned about rivers not having weirs.  Farmers do not like weirs which are often - wrongly in my opinion - for causing flooding in particular areas.  How are the matters to which I have just referred addressed in the Revised Estimates.  There are some issues raised by Deputy Kitt in respect of which I may be obliged to intervene again later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900008#G00500","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373389200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>On heritage, I wish to comment on the historic towns initiative pilot scheme.

Will this initiative be extended to other heritage towns in the future?  Will there be a second tranche of funding for the towns included under the pilot scheme?  Will the Minister indicate if particular projects are going to be put in place in respect of the three towns to which I refer?<\/p><p>  There have been some very disproportionate cuts to the funding allocated to the Irish language sector in recent years.  There has been a 6.4% reduction in the funding for Gaeltacht support schemes, a 9.4% reduction in the moneys for Irish language support schemes and a 4.4% cut in respect of the islands.  As far as I am aware, the Government has not yet implemented the provisions of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 in full.  In that context, I understand a number of statutory instruments remain to be put in place.  It is clear that there is a lack of resources available in the context of language planning.  How does the Minister justify the limited spending in this regard and the reduction in funding in respect of the schemes, etc., to which I refer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900009#H00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1373389200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Deputies &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and McLellan referred to heritage towns.  When they were first designated, heritage towns attracted a huge amount of interest.  At the outset, the branding in this regard was very effective in the beginning and people witnessed the benefits of it.  Signs were placed on the outskirts of towns to indicate that they were heritage towns and this led to them attracting a great deal of interest and prestige.  The scheme, which came under the remit of F&aacute;ilte Ireland - and Bord F&aacute;ilte before it - was allowed to lapse and no one took responsibility for it.  When the residents of heritage towns and their representatives indicated their disappointment to me in this regard, I decided that we should do something about such towns.  I mentioned the matter to one of my officials, Mr. Martin Colreavy, who proceeded to discuss it with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As a result, the latter developed the historic towns initiative pilot scheme in order to revitalise the entire programme.  Overall, there are 34 heritage towns throughout the country.  For a variety of reasons, F&aacute;ilte Ireland chose three of these for the pilot scheme and despite the fact that its budget is extremely tight, the Department provided &euro;240,000 - &euro;80,000 per town.  We expected that F&aacute;ilte Ireland might provide the same amount of funding but it could not do so as a result of the constraints relating to its budget.  It did, however, provide a total of &euro;90,000 - &euro;30,000 per town.  We also asked the towns themselves to provide &euro;80,000.  I suppose it is a nice pot of money.<\/p><p>  We asked the towns to indicate what they would do with the money they received.  They each came up with programmes in this regard and these have proven to be very effective.

I hope that the historic towns initiative will be rolled out to the remainder of the 34 heritage towns, at a rate of three each year.  In view of the fact that there is a successful template in place, I am sure it can actually be rolled out to those towns.

It is working well.<\/p><p>  On the question of thatched cottages, there is a little thatched house in the village I come from but unfortunately, some time ago the thatch got burned and at present a thatcher is on site restoring it.  This little house is in the centre of the village and is a landmark.  I agree with the Deputy that people stop to take photographs of it every day.  People associate the thatched cottage with Ireland, especially the west.  A visiting tourist gets a surprise when he or she sees a thatched house.  I see that every day with people stopping to take photographs of the thatched house in my village.  At present we provide funding for structures at risk, if a local council proposes funding for a thatched house because of its age and heritage value, that would be considered by the Department.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provide a package for thatching houses, as it is expensive to have a house thatched and the insurance is prohibitive.  The thatched house in my village is in community ownership but this is the second fire in the cottage.  The cost of insurance is becoming more relevant now than previously.  The thatched houses are under review and if we had the possibility of funding, we would like to target it at them.<\/p><p>  A figure of &euro;110,000 is allocated in the Revised Estimate for the protection of the golden eagle, the red kite and the white-tailed eagle.  These projects are going well.  The scheme for the red kite in Counties Wicklow and Dublin has been quite successful.  The introduction of the golden eagle and the white-tailed eagle in County Donegal has also been quite successful.  I agree with the Deputy that these are important schemes and it is very important that we preserve the species that are under threat or in danger of extinction.  The white-tailed and golden eagle and the red kite were endangered species.  I agree with Deputes that some of the rangers in the National Parks and Wildlife Service have a very difficult job.  They are advising people not to cut hedgerows because of nesting, not to burn commonages because of ground nesting birds and not to cut turf in protected bogs, which is forbidden by Irish and European law.  Some rangers were threatened on social media and in other ways, which is very unfair on them and on their families.  I hope that with the end of the turf cutting season this will stop.  I was very concerned by this campaign because the rangers are doing a difficult job protecting nature, which will be beneficial for our country.  They are public officials and should be treated with respect.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to the designation of heritage towns and I can now tell Deputy McLellan that as long as I am in this job I will be putting the emphasis on extending this scheme.  The scheme has got off to a very good start and we now have the tools to designate other towns and extend the scheme.<\/p><p>  I can confirm for Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l that the contribution to Waterways Ireland is more than &euro;25 million and that includes the major maintenance work.   Maintenance absorbs most of the money because it is very difficult to maintain the system, which is approximately 1,000 kilometres.  Much of the work must be done by people because one cannot get machinery to do that type of work.  About 95% of the navigable waterways are available for navigation from April to October.  We must constantly examine all of the waterways because obstructions can occur if materials are dumped in the waterways.  Remedial work must be undertaken continuously on the 1,000 km of waterways.  It is a very important resource and links all the island.<\/p><p>  I will now hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900010#J00300","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1373389800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900010#J00400","speaker":"1000"},{"type":"speech","time":1373389800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State addresses the committee, may I ask him a question?

Since I learned to read there has been an Irish language newspaper.  Decades ago there was an Irish language newspaper <i>Am&aacute;rach<\/i>, which was followed by <i>Inni&uacute;<\/i>, then <i>L&aacute;<\/i> and then <i>Gaelsc&eacute;al<\/i>.  It is regrettable that <i>Gaelsc&eacute;al <\/i>has been discontinued, but it was subsidised by &euro;400,000 per annum and the subsidy on each copy ranged between &euro;6 and &euro;7.  It was not economically viable.  I know that Foras na Gaeilge is looking at other ways to replace what has gone.  <i>Foinse<\/i> is issued weekly as an adjunct to one of the national daily newspapers.  There is a vacuum.  It is envisaged that a new service will be provided some time in the future.  I understand there is an online newspaper available but people like to have a newspaper in their hands.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan referred to the reduction in funding for Irish language and Gaeltacht activities.  Of course, our Department, like every other Department, suffered a reduction in funding.<\/p> <p>We are no different from those in the health and education sectors.  Nevertheless, we are maintaining front-line services for those who use the Irish language, in the Gaeltacht and on the islands.  The reduction is more pronounced in the capital budget rather than the current budget from which front-line services to the Gaeltacht are maintained.  For instance, this year the Department has a total allocation of &euro;8.223 million for language schemes in the Gaeltacht.  This includes current funding of &euro;6.723 million and capital funding of &euro;1.5 million.  This funding is to support worthy schemes to support the speaking of the language and its development in Gaeltacht areas and I am glad to state there has been no reduction in any of the schemes.  This year the Department is maintaining the schemes it operated last year, including, for instance, sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, under which approximately 24,000 students from different parts of the country attend Gaeltacht courses on an annual basis and for which &euro;4.2 million has been allocated.  In addition, there is the family support scheme which I announced in April 2012, for which &euro;2.5 million is available in 2013.  Its purpose is to advance the 20 year strategy on the Irish language.  The Department is concentrating not on the infrastructure of the Gaeltacht but on giving priority to schemes that will protect the language and give incentives to parents and young people to have Irish as their first language.  For instance, the Department is in touch with parents even before their children attend school.  When children are born, parents are given an information package at a cost of approximately &euro;40 - the Department has already distributed approximately 1,500 - outlining the advantages and reasons they should consider having Irish as the child's first language.  As I stated, 1,500 such packages have been distributed and it is envisaged that a further 1,000 will be distributed before the end of the year.  In addition, funding is available for Irish language support schemes outside the Gaeltacht, for which &euro;4.2 million is available in 2013, comprising current funding of &euro;4.1 million and capital funding of &euro;100,000.  Nevertheless, despite the percentages to which the Deputy referred, I am confident that the work will continue and that the Department will continue to support the schemes in place.  <\/p><p> Did the Deputy also refer to the islands?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900010#J00600","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373390400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Yes, I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900011#K00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1373390400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The Department also has responsibility in this regard.

A sum of &euro;5.9 million is available for passenger, cargo and air services, as well as transport services on the mainland.  The Department is confident that this amount will be maintained.  The issue with which it is grappling concerns the ferry services that have been arranged, as well as the cargo and air services to the Aran Islands.  Questions arose last year and I am glad that negotiations are under way to continue the service.  The current contract expires at the end of August and the Department is confident, as the negotiations are ongoing, that it will continue for a further year after 31 August, with the possibility of it continuing for a further year.  The Department is, of course, obliged under European Union regulations to carry out a feasibility study of the need for a continuation of this transport, but I am fairly confident that for next year and probably the year after it will be possible to maintain it.  As I stated, the capital moneys available for the islands have been reduced drastically.  Nevertheless, &euro;100 million has been spent on capital developments on the islands in the past ten years.

That, in itself, was a challenge because of environmental and other reasons.  The next process will be the CPOs to get the land.  In many cases, hopefully, we can acquire the land by agreement.  That will be the next challenge.<\/p><p>  There is an inter-agency group sitting.  It is something I established, where the local authorities and the statutory organisations, North and South, have all come together around a table and are looking for alternative sources of funding too rather than merely funding from the Dublin Government.  Originally, the agreement was that this would be funded by Dublin and the funding for it was identified with the sale of property at the time.  During the Celtic tiger, the property, down in the docklands, etc., was quite valuable.  However, with the collapse of the property market, that potential source of funding was not there to the same extent, although, with the property market now recovering, that property could become valuable again.  Hopefully, it will and can contribute to the overall costs.<\/p><p>  The next stage would be the acquisition of the land in order to provide the canal and the inter-agency group is looking at possibilities.  Also, my counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA, is looking at possible funding for the small portion that is in the North.  Funding may be available for that from the Northern Executive and, maybe, Westminster.  That, obviously, would help.  Wherever we can get funding for this, certainly we will be striving to get it.  It will be incremental.  We will have to approach it on a staged basis but the important point is to get it started.<\/p><p>  It is a good North-South project.  It links North and South.  There also could be some possibilities under European funding, for example, there was funding available for the Ballyconnell canal and some of that was derived from European funding.  We will be looking at every possible source of funding in order to get the project off the ground and to complete it over a period of time.  Besides, Waterways Ireland, from its own capital budget, may have some small amount of funding available to initiate the project as well.  I will be looking at identifying funding from different sources and, hopefully, over a period of time, we can provide the canal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22013070900012#L00800","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1373391000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>That concludes the select sub-committee's consideration of the Revised Estimates for Vote 33 - Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Vote 34 - National Gallery of Ireland.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, and their officials, an t-Uasal &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, Ms Killoran, an t-Uasal &Oacute; Raghallaigh, an t-Uasal &Oacute; Coigligh and Mr. Donnelly, for attending today's meeting of the select sub-committee.
