It is interesting that there has been approximately a 400% increase in the number of families sleeping in emergency or temporary accommodation for the homeless since October 2014.  That is a rise from 800 families in that situation to 2,177 in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, we only had an average of eight new families presenting as homeless in Dublin every month, but that rose to 40 families per month in 2014, and has risen to 70 per month in the first half of this year.  Clearly, therefore, the situation is getting worse year after year.  For far too long the last government denied the existence of a crisis and only belatedly declared it a national emergency.  It published many strategies which were lacking in detail, implementation and execution in terms of their impact on building new houses.  For example, fewer than 274 new social houses were constructed in 2015, and only 28 of those were directly built by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee on Housing and Homelessness, chaired by Deputy John Curran, did a lot of good cross-party work in coming up with solutions.  The Minister has announced his response today.  My key question to the Taoiseach concerns the execution, administrative and statutory capacity to deliver the scale of houses required to meet the challenges.  Very few council houses were built by councils in 2015 and 2016, to date, yet we are now looking in the plan at up to 47,000 new social houses.  One must question the current capacity of the system to deliver that number.<\/p>  <p>  Is it not the case that a separate statutory institution or agency is required with wide-ranging powers to drive home house-building and deal with what is, by any yardstick, a national emergency?<\/p><p>Anybody who listened in this morning to \"Morning Ireland\" will have heard that we have had children living in hotels in Dublin in recent years, the impact of which on families, mothers, fathers and children was eloquently and graphically articulated.  It is a true blight on our society.  Notwithstanding all the strategies in the world that we publish, I am concerned about the capacity to execute delivery of this plan.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the statutory administrative capacity to deliver it exists?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468933500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>As we speak, the Minister with responsibility for housing is attending with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and others at the formal launch of the Government's housing action plan and so the Deputy's question is very pertinent and appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  We have made no secret that the issue of providing accommodation and proper housing for people, both social and affordable, and dealing with homelessness is a key priority of Government.  That is why &euro;5.3 billion is being provided, with 47,000 houses to be provided by 2021.  Obviously, execution of the plan is an important point.  The consultation with the entire spectrum of interested parties has been thorough.  I commended Deputy John Curran and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness on the report they produced.  There is an appendix at the back of the plan dealing with each proposal brought forward by the Oireachtas committee, which is right and proper because these formed part of the detailed conversations and discussions that were held by the committee on this matter.  The plan contains five pillars.  It will be debated in the House this evening and tomorrow, during which time Deputies from all sides and all parties will have an opportunity to comment on it.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in recent years, local authorities have not measured up in the building of social housing to the extent needed.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has looked at this carefully and has provided local authorities with a &euro;200 million fund for access to sites that are currently inaccessible, either by bridge or road and to allow councils to design their own schemes in respect of certain conditions being applied.  He has also provided for expedited capacity for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to allow it deal directly with applications that are usually first lodged with the local authorities and then transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, such that in a situation where there is no further requirement for information, an answer will be given one way or the other inside 18 weeks.  This is a serious attempt, following serious discussions by Government, to deal with this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The first pillar of the plan on housing and homeless deals with homelessness.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has pointed out everybody should read the long and detailed first chapter of the plan because of the impact of homelessness.  It is not appropriate that families and children in particular would be in inappropriate accommodation, bed and breakfast establishments or hotels.  Obviously, the plan is set out in detail and is not only costed but timelined.  It will be overseen by the Cabinet sub-committee and monitored carefully by the Minister.  It is a case now of seeing if local authorities can measure up to the challenge they have been given with the resources they have been supplied with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468933500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The question is whether the Taoiseach blames the local authorities for the mess of the past five years or their inability to get to grips with it as it continued to grow.  I recall being in the House for Leaders' Questions during which the Government denied for a long time that there was a problem.  The Focus Ireland statistics in regard to homelessness among children increased in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  It was a market-led approach and we were told the market would correct but it did not.  We got the same response to rent allowance for three years.  The Government told us there was no way it was going to increase rent allowance.  There was an ideological resistance to it.  At long last the rent allowance has been increased.  Following engagement, discussions, party conferences and so on, it has happened.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is fair to blame the local authorities.<\/p><p>Yes, they need to be looked at as well but it is a scandal that there are any empty houses in local authority housing stock given the emergency.  It is incredible.  Deputy Cowen submitted a freedom of information request.  There are still 2,700 empty local authority houses throughout the country.  In the name of God, does anybody realise that there is an urgency and an emergency out there?  There are people coming to our clinics who would take those houses in the morning, but what does the Government do?  It puts a limit on 30,000 houses, over and above which a local authority must seek permission.  The local authority must go through an eight-stage process, which has reduced to four stages.  Local authority officials are telling me that this has made it worse.  The Taoiseach needs to cut through a lot of this.  I put to him that given the emergency with which we are dealing, we need national administrative and statutory capacity to knock heads together and get delivery.  That is the only way it is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900004#B00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468933800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The plan will be debated in the D&aacute;il today and tomorrow.  It is important to say that local authorities have performed very indifferently in many cases.  Some are better than others.  However, they were not responsible for the complete collapse of the housing sector.  We know what happened to the construction sector in general.  Obviously, many builders went out of business while many others emigrated and the economy did not have the capacity to develop these things.<\/p>  <p>  All these issues are being looked at in great detail by the Minister and his officials across Government, not just in one Department.  This is also to address the unacceptable number of families in emergency accommodation and involves looking at moderating rental and purchase price inflation, particularly in urban areas.  We are aware of this.  There was never a denial of the fact that there was a problem.  There was always an acceptance and understanding that the construction sector had collapsed from building 90,000 houses down to fewer than 10,000.  There is also the issue of addressing the affordability gap for many households wishing to purchase their own homes.  The Minister will refer to opportunities to deal with that which will present themselves later.  Other issues include the rental sector, void units and empty houses throughout the country that could be purchased.  The Minister has addressed all of these issues in considerable detail through the five pillars, and I hope Members will give their views during the discussion today and tomorrow.

The Government and Fianna F&aacute;il blocked this motion.  The Taoiseach claimed that the allegations relating to the sale of Project Eagle had nothing to do with NAMA as an entity.  Yet it emerged last week that the chairperson of NAMA, Frank Daly, wrote to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, in March to say that a member of NAMA's advisory board in Northern Ireland might have contravened the Ethics in Public Office Act while serving on the board.  The Taoiseach will recall that this board member was alleged to have been charging clients fees for advice relating to NAMA.  It is also alleged that he had an unethical working relationship with the head of asset recovery at NAMA which gave him access to sensitive commercial information.  It is further alleged that he was lobbying on behalf of fee-paying clients to reduce loan repayments.  In return, he would receive cash payments - the so-called fixer fees - and all this is very well documented.<\/p>  <p>  Frank Daly's letter to SIPO rubbishes the notion put forward by the Taoiseach that the sale of Project Eagle has nothing to do with NAMA.  It has everything to do with NAMA and there are serious questions for NAMA to answer in respect of all this.  However, the Taoiseach says there is nothing to see.  In respect of the SIPO complaint, NAMA needs to explain why it waited until March 2016 to write to SIPO when it was aware of the issues involved in March 2014.  All of this is on the public record.

On the question of value for money, we fully support the ongoing examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the disposal by NAMA of the loans of Northern Ireland debtors.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, as Deputy Adams is aware, is best positioned to independently review the transaction in this jurisdiction.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is required by law under section 226 of the NAMA Act to produce a report every three years assessing the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall targets.  NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July 2015.  At that appearance, the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that his next section 226 report required under law would look in detail at a sample of NAMA disposals and a sample of properties held by it for investment and, furthermore, that a specific review of Project Eagle under section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act would be undertaken.  I am quite sure Deputy Adams supports the integrity and credibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That report into Project Eagle, as I understand it, is practically completed.  It will be debated by the Committee of Public Accounts, which is the accountable body in respect of NAMA.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts both hold NAMA accountable here.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that he intends to issue a report under section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act following this review of Project Eagle.  This is consistent entirely with the law and with his powers of investigation to scrutinise and report on operations or regarding any aspect of NAMA's work that may arise through its annual audits or special reports about any aspect of NAMA's work.  Mr. Daly was doing his duty of seeing that everything was above board in respect of the law and his responsibilities.  The Department of Finance and NAMA have received a draft of the report and are providing comment to the Comptroller and Auditor General on that draft report.  Officials of the Comptroller and Auditor General have also confirmed that, given their independent role, any queries related to the timing, content or any other specific aspects of their reports should be directed to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the first instance.  I am informed by NAMA, as I said before, that the loan portfolio in question was sold following an open process to the highest bidder for what it was worth.  On the question about allegations made against certain individuals in Northern Ireland, NAMA paid no moneys to any party on this loan sale against whom allegations of wrongdoing are now being made.  As I said previously, anyone with any evidence of wrongdoing needs to immediately report it to the relevant authorities.  I am aware that two individuals were held for questioning as part of the UK National Crime Agency's investigation into the sale of Northern Ireland assets owned by NAMA.  I am advised also that the NCA has confirmed to NAMA that no aspect of the agency's activities is under investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900006#D00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468934400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I reassure the Taoiseach that of course I support the Comptroller and Auditor General, but his role is restricted and limited.

This week, he is saying it is okay and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is dealing with it.  Last week he said, \"the Minister for Finance has a view that no specific line of inquiry here can stand up and be usefully pursued by a commission of investigation.\"  This is the same Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, whom Frank Daly said he briefed in full on these matters, including on the scandal of the &pound;15 million fixer fee.

I gather from media reports that this report was considered by Government today and will be published this afternoon.  The media reports made clear that the Low Pay Commission has recommended an increase of 10 cent per hour to the minimum wage.  It is fair to say that this is a disappointing recommendation for the thousands of low-paid workers in the Irish economy.  For a full-time worker, this would translate to just about &euro;200 per year, hardly enough to lift a family out of poverty, I think we will all agree.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the Low Pay Commission was a progressive move and the issue I raise here today is no reflection on the membership of the commission.  Instead, I will focus on the Government's role.  In the UK, their Low Pay Commission has been tasked with raising the minimum wage to at least 60% of median earnings by 2020.  That was the specific target given to it by the British Government.  During the general election, that was the policy that my party advocated.  We expected to see the minimum wage rise to &euro;11.50 an hour by 2020, an increase of approximately &euro;5,000 a year.  The programme for a partnership Government, published by Fine Gael published with its Government partners for this term, was less ambitious than what the Labour Party set out during the election, but it still included a commitment that it would support an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 an hour over the next five years.  Unfortunately, it appears the Taoiseach has not done anything to achieve that target set out in the Government programme.  Instead of achieving a level of &euro;11.50 within five years, if we continue at the current rate of recommendations today, we will not see that target reached until 2029.<\/p>  <p>  My questions are straightforward.  Why has the Taoiseach not changed the terms of reference for the Low Pay Commission to mandate it to deliver an increase in the minimum wage to at least &euro;10.50 an hour within the five years set out in the programme for Government?  Will the Taoiseach agree to implement such changes so that the Low Pay Commission will have a mandate before it produces its next report?<\/p><p>In light of the recent work that has confirmed the consensus on the living wage to be approximately &euro;11.50 per hour, will the Taoiseach revise the commitment in the programme for Government to reach that level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900007#E00400","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468935000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for his question.  The Low Pay Commission is an independent entity set up by the previous Government to bring a structure and a realism to claims for increases in the minimum wage.  As the Deputy is well aware, the Low Pay Commission was set up because of the nature of the way claims were being put forward prior to that.  The former Minister of State, now Senator Gerald Nash, did much work on that with the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was interested in having a low pay commission to bring about independent objectivity.  One of the first decisions of the previous Government was to reverse a cut in the minimum wage that had been brought about before, and it increased the wage by 50 cent.  This is an independent entity.  The Government approved the publication of the report today, 19 July, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation now has three months to consider the implications of the report before coming back to the Government in September.  There is a minority report, as the Deputy is aware.  There are nine members on the Low Pay Commission and three of those had a different view.  The report must be considered carefully by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Howlin is well aware from his own experience, the Low Pay Commission values its independence and would not want to be in the position of being directed.  The &euro;10.50 rate referred to in the programme for Government was an indication of what might be achieved over a five-year Government.  Whereas the recommendation is for an extra 10 cent per hour, this is clearly an indication of how seriously the employers and specialists in the area view the implications of the decision from the British referendum on EU membership.  They have made their judgment and I consider taking the possible implications of that into account.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will consider the report in its entirety and has three months to come back to the Government.  She will do so in September.  As the Deputy is aware, we favour having a position where work is seen to pay and there is an incentive for people to go to work.

At best, it is yet another mirage and false dawn for those who desperately need solutions to the housing crisis.  At worst, I believe it to be a cynical exercise in spoof and dishonesty in that it masks a move to retreat from the provision of local authority housing to the privatisation of housing provision under the guise of a promise of an increase in social housing provision.<\/p>  <p>  If that contention is not true, the Taoiseach will be able to answer a simple question - an answer that is not contained in the report.  How many local authority houses will be built between 2016 to 2020, the years of this plan?  I am being very specific; my question is about local authority houses.  I am not asking about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, leasing arrangements, public private partnerships or approved housing bodies.  I am asking about council houses.  How many will be built?  It is not in the report, it was never in Deputy Alan Kelly's report and the Taoiseach never answers that question.  I believe what is clearly spelt out in this document is that this is all about more incentives, grants and supports for private developers and vulture funds, in the hope of creating a mirage that the private, for profit sector will deliver the social housing we need when it will not.  What we need are council houses.<\/p>  <p>  If I am wrong, the Taoiseach should tell me.  Will he give me the specific figures?  How many council houses will be built next year and in subsequent years?  I suspect the Taoiseach will not be able to give me the answer to the question.

The Deputy will not be able to answer my question either.  Some 47,000 social housing units are to be delivered by 2021, supported by an investment of &euro;5.35 billion.  That is real money that is on the table.  However, Deputy Boyd Barrett will not be able to answer the question as to the impact of a housing delivery unit being set up in the Department with responsibility for housing.  This unit will work with every local authority to improve the opportunity to build council houses.  There will be a provision of money for the building of bridges, roads or access points, as the case may be, to get access to sites that are currently inaccessible.  Councils will have the opportunity to design their own houses.  The planning process will be expedited so that these things can happen.<\/p>  <p>  The overall objective is to deliver 47,000 houses by 2021.  It is impossible for any chief executive to say today that X number of council houses will be built by year end.  When we take into account these facilities, the housing delivery unit in the Department and the opportunity for local authorities throughout the country to avail of the incentives to open up sites they have not been able to open up before, to expedite planning and to design their own houses, the answer to this question will become clearer as we move along.<\/p><p>The overall objective is for 47,000 houses with &euro;5.35 billion on the table to make it happen.

Some local authorities perform better than others but voids and the regeneration of neglected houses into liveable units are opportunities for social houses to be provided by local authorities.  <\/p> <p> It is not possible to answer the Deputy's question directly because the answer lies in the incentives and facilities being made available to local authorities and the chief executives of those local authorities to get on with it and prove they can measure up both to the numbers and the timetable that has been set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900009#G00600","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468935600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I did not know this was questions to People Before Profit - I thought it was questions to the Taoiseach.

That confirms that we are just getting a rehashed, slightly upscaled version of the Kelly plan.  There are big headline figures but when one scratches beneath the surface, it is all dependent on \"incentives\" to the private sector in the shape of infrastructural grants and the transfer of public land.

Now we mourn the death of 84 people, and the serious injuries suffered by many more, after the latest in this appalling litany of outrage.<\/p><p>Each of these attacks has been the same in its dreadful consequences, but each has had its own distinctly horrific features.  People have been killed for who they were - journalists or Jews.  People have been killed as they enjoyed an autumn Friday evening out, as they travelled to work or through an international airport and now, just after they had watched spectacular fireworks by the Mediterranean at the end of France&rsquo;s national day.<\/p><p>In each case, they have been killed as they enjoyed - and because they enjoyed - the freedoms offered by our western civilisation.  The freedom of expression and the freedom of religion.  The freedom to have a drink, to listen to music, for men and women, gay and straight, to be together on a night out.  The freedom to travel and to work.  The freedom to come together to celebrate the eternal values of France - liberty, equality and fraternity.<\/p><p>Those who were murdered on Thursday night were French and foreign, young and old, male and female.  Families were wiped out or shattered forever.  The innocent faces of the youngest victims are deeply poignant, but so too is the face of the 73 year old grandmother who was the first person to be killed, and in a bitter irony, she was only one of many Muslims to be killed by someone purporting to act in the name of Islam.<\/p><p>We do not know if the killer acted alone or as part of a conspiracy, even though his attack was claimed by ISIS.  His methods were cruder than those used in previous attacks.  It does seem clear that he was a deeply disturbed and unstable person - at first glance, similar to those responsible for so many gun attacks in the United States of America, most recently in Orlando.<\/p><p>Ireland stands by France.  France is a great nation, the birthplace of republicanism and of universal human rights.  These values are more precious than ever in our turbulent and dangerous world and must be protected.  I look forward very much to greeting President Hollande in Dublin on Thursday, as will President Higgins, and to conveying to him in person the deep sympathy and outrage felt by the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>We must do all we can to combat evil and to protect our citizens.

Ireland works very closely with France and other international partners, and within the EU significant progress has been made on a wide range of counter-terrorism legislation and other practical measures of co-operation, though there is also a very long way to go.  There is also an intensified focus on combating and rooting out the ideology of hate, an ideology totally inconsistent with true religious belief.<\/p><p>It is a sad reality, however, that no defences can guarantee absolute safety, above all, against an attack so chillingly rage-filled and basic as that of Bastille Day, but we cannot allow ourselves to be cowed or beaten by terrorism, and we will not.<\/p><p>The best response is to continue to live our lives in accordance with the values of our society because in the end, liberty and love will triumph over repression and hate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900011#J00100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468935900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and on my own behalf, I want again to join with Deputies in sending our sincerest sympathy to the families bereaved by this appalling act of terror, which raises the threshold of inhumanity to an incomprehensible level.

There is a natural urge to find refuge in broad definitions of the enemy.  New types of terror require new and robust responses.  The democratic will cannot be defenceless in the face of those who seek to destroy it but, equally, we must never forget what it is we defend.  There are those who love nothing more than to attack the values of Europe by refusing to acknowledge anything that distinguishes it from places dominated by cruel and dominant governments.  Nothing will ever convince them.  However, Europe is a continent which is defined by a respect for democracy and human rights beyond any other region in the world.  France must not stop being France because of these attacks and Europe must not stop being Europe because that is exactly what the terrorists want.  They want us to act like them and they want to inspire an extreme reaction.  They want to make things immeasurably worse for the communities from whence they came.

We also remember them.  They died in the former French colony in Baton Rouge.  It is as if the bodies keep falling since that day when something happened that we could never have imagined, when someone flew a plane into a trade centre.  Now, someone has used a truck in a way we could never have thought of.  There is a sense that we should just shout &quot;Stop&quot; - that we need a different constitution, a bigger constitution.  We need a different Bastille Day, one with peace and mercy at its core.  As others said, all we can do is kneel with the parents of those who died near that Nice strand and remember the words of the Trojan mother Hecuba when she said in response to her child being thrown from the walls of the city, crushed and broken:<\/p><blockquote>Oh to clasp thy tender limbs, a mother's fondest joy!  Oh to breathe thy fragrant breath! ... Why have ye in terror of this child been guilty of murder never matched before?<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900015#N00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I ask Deputies to stand as a mark of respect for those who have died, and thoughtful of those who remain injured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468937700,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Members rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1468937700,"counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I call on the rapporteur for the business committee, Deputy Jim Daly, to announce the Order of Business for the week and to move the proposals regarding arrangements for the taking of that business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900016#O00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1468937700,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Today's business shall be No. 11, motion re Standing Orders 141 and 146A, and No. 12, motion re business of select committees, without debate.

They looked at the way the force was deployed, the way resources were deployed, its mechanism for following through on investigations and its information relating to the time for investigation of every particular type of crime in each division.

Many residents - families and their children - are living in fear.  The Taoiseach met with some of them recently and he quite rightly praised and commended their resilience and steadfastness.  Since then, as well as the fear arising from the gang feud and the ongoing drugs trade in that area, there is also a concern that once the media focus moves off onto other issues the commitments and promises of support from the Government will not be delivered.  The Taoiseach will know that what the people want and need is an integrated plan for the social, economic, educational and community development of their community.  They are looking for funding, projects, jobs, counsellors, homes, teachers for children, Garda youth diversion projects, addiction services and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach asked recently for the terms of reference of the community coalition in Dublin's north inner city and, with their permission, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald provided him with this.  He agreed to meet with representatives of the coalition and bring back proposals to them about the task force and its terms of reference and so on.  I do not want to presume or make judgment on what the Taoiseach said earlier but, if I heard him properly, he said he was going to the constituency tomorrow and appears to have agreed the terms of reference.  Will he give us some sense of the terms of reference and recommit to consulting in good faith with the people he met, given the seriousness of the issues involved?  It is all about empowering people.  These people have empowered themselves.  The Taoiseach said in an earlier discussion here that there appeared to be a gap between what has happened in here and what is happening down there.  I challenged the Taoiseach on this.  I said it is not that there appears to be a gap; there is a gap.  The Taoiseach made a firm commitment about consultation and going back to consult with the folks he met previously.  I ask him to give us as much information as he can on that.  <\/p>  <p>  I request an update on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Garda Inspectorate report, Changing Policing in Ireland, and I also request that he address the concern about a whole range of Garda appointments that were made.  I do not want to go through them all, as I do not want to take up other people's time.  A whole range of promotions were made which could and should have been made by the policing authority, but there was a rush to do this at the request of the Garda Commissioner before the authority was authorised to do it.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about this?  It strikes me as being something that does not bode well for what we are trying to do in terms of a new beginning to policing, or at least the effort to reform the garda&iacute; so that it is a service that its men and women deserve and that those whom they mind deserve also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900020#S00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1468939800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>A number of questions were asked.  Deputy Howlin raised the membership of the Cabinet committee on justice reform, comprised of myself, as chair, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Attorney General.  As others are needed they will attend.  The terms of reference are to provide political oversight of the delivery of commitments in the programme for a partnership Government, to reform the policing, justice and legal systems and related issues.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned the Inspectorate report.  In November 2014, the Garda Inspectorate published a comprehensive report on crime investigation, and significant work is continuing to implement the recommendations.  That includes a review of crime counting rules by the CSO, the establishment of a data quality team in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, significant reorganisation and amalgamation of Garda national units, and the establishment of a criminal justice steering group to provide greater co-ordination between all bodies operating within the criminal justice system.  The Garda has established a new incident recording process and a working group has examined the need for increased investment in Garda ICT as part of the upcoming capital programme.  The Garda has established a victim support office in every local Garda division and, in addition, the previous Government put in place measures to ensure and enhance ongoing public confidence in policing in Ireland while continuing to support the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their day-to-day duties of keeping communities in the country safe.  On the Garda Inspectorate report on management and structures, the T&aacute;naiste put in place a process to seek the views of the Garda Commissioner, to whom the bulk of recommendations are directed, and other bodies to whom recommendations are directed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned modern technology.  As he is aware, &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital programme, is being invested in the Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This major investment will allow the garda&iacute; to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on an important set of reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on crime investigation.  A considerable amount of the new Garda ICT solutions have been delivered over the past five years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system, the deployment and support of Garda and community CCTV systems, an automated number plate registration, ANPR, system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Davitt House in Castlebar.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial additional investment under the capital programme out to 2021 will facilitate progress on a range of other important reforms that arise from the Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  Examples of some of the new systems to be developed include new computer-aided despatch to ensure responsive and co-ordinated deployment of garda&iacute; in the community, mobile technology to give garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it, investigation management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations, and an upgrade of the ANPR to enhance policing of road safety and compliance.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is an interest in supplying increased numbers of CCTV systems as well.<\/p> <p> In respect of Deputy Adams' question on gangland crime, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has been in close and extensive engagement with the Garda Commissioner and senior officers on the measures to tackle the appalling crime situation in certain areas where gangs operate and significant progress has been made in the investigations which are under way.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and I have assured the Garda that whatever resources are necessary will be made available to it.  On the basis of that assurance, the Garda, day in and day out, is incurring substantial additional expenditure, including overtime expenditure.<\/p> <p> On 8 June, the Government approved substantial additional funding to be provided to the Garda.  An additional allocation of &euro;55 million is being made available this year for the purpose of tackling organised crime.  These additional moneys are made available based on information from Garda management regarding the level of funding required to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation.  This will allow for concentrated policing targeting gang-related crime and the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through the support for Operation Thor, which has been successful, and continued support for measures against terrorism.<\/p> <p> Underpinning all of that has been the reopening of Templemore and the decision to increase the Garda strength to 15,000 by way of recruitment.  While in the short term substantial funds continue to be made available for overtime working measures to accelerate the planned programme of recruitment, they are being worked on now so that additional new garda&iacute; can be provided as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I note that the Criminal Assets Bureau is one of the few areas of public expenditure that was largely ring-fenced from reductions in public service staffing during the economic crisis.  Its staffing complement now of approximately 70 is similar to what it was in the late 2000s.<\/p> <p> In respect of Garda measures to deal with gangland crime, the new special crime task force has been put in place.  This will operate in co-operation with other agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.

I am satisfied that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  We work closely with the devolved administrations in the context of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council.  In preparing for the European Council meeting, I had a wide range of discussions, including with the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister and with the Scottish First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, whom I had also met at the British-Irish Council in Glasgow on 17 June.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Scotland enjoy excellent and close relations, as, indeed, we do with the UK as a whole.  The recent visit by President Higgins underlined once more the strength of the ties between the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  The First Minister, Ms Sturgeon, was anxious that European leaders would be aware of her concerns about the future situation and status of Scotland following a UK departure from the Union.  I undertook to mention those concerns during the European Council meeting, which I did.  This was in the context of a wide-ranging discussion on the referendum outcome and its consequences, on which I reported in detail to the House on the 5 July.  I look forward to ongoing contact with the First Minister and her administration at political, diplomatic and official levels.  We will have an opportunity to meet again at the extraordinary meeting of the British-Irish Council on Friday of this week in Cardiff.<\/p>  <p>  It is self-evident that the outcome of the referendum on EU membership has generated significant debate in all parts of the United Kingdom and beyond.  Many aspects of the next steps in this process require clarification that will only emerge now that the new British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has been appointed.  In my discussions with Mrs. May last week, we discussed a range of issues of mutual interest, not least the importance of continuing to work together to build on the excellent relationship that now exists between Ireland and Britain, including our joint support of the peace process and the wider development of co-operation between these two islands.  We agreed to stay in touch and to meet each other in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900021#T01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468940400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  With a new Government in place in London, there is emerging a basic shape of the approach that may be taken by the United Kingdom Government to negotiations with the European Union.  Mr. Davis, the new British Secretary of State responsible for Brexit, has suggested that he is fine with simply seeking a trade pact and that he may delay the triggering of Article 50 until next year.  That would have significant implications for Ireland, and particularly Mr. Davis's narrow view of the negotiation parameters with Britain.  It could involve the return of a customs border here, if his thinking gains any further momentum.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Davis also seemed somewhat confused as to the status of what he termed \"southern Ireland\", when asked about this country on Sunday.  He seemed to be unaware of our constitutional status, to put it mildly.  Could the Taoiseach, at the earliest opportunity, ensure that a member of Government holds an early meeting with Mr. Davis to update him on our perspectives on it?<\/p>  <p>  More specifically concerning Scotland, it is clear that we need to stay closely in contact with the Scottish Government on an ongoing basis.  I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to implement a suggestion I made to increase staffing in our European embassies and delegations - the Taoiseach made that clear at the leaders' meeting last week - but the Taoiseach needs to make a similar commitment to increasing the staff levels at our Edinburgh consulate, which was set up quite a number of years ago and which has played a valuable role in developing relationships between Ireland and the Scottish Government and, indeed, the Scottish Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach was correct in raising the matter at the European Council meeting because it is the elephant in the room in some respects as well.  It is relevant in terms of what may happen down the road in Scotland, if it was ever to secede from the United Kingdom.  That is something that may take some time to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply the British-Irish Council and the broader sets of relationships.  I note the key issues, apart from Mr. David Davis saying it is about trade.  For us, it is obviously the retention of and, ideally and optimally, the UK's access to the Single Market to avoid tariffs between Ireland and Britain, but also the common travel area.  The retention of the Single Market on the island of Ireland is critical, as is the avoidance of a hard border.  I suggested an all-island dialogue on Brexit which would involve community groups, non-governmental organisations, the economic stakeholders, unions, business, etc.<\/p><p>Apart from the political constitutional elements, I am looking at a civil dialogue involving civil organisations.  The Taoiseach is broadly committed to that.  It would allow people from the civic and social side in Northern Ireland to make a contribution to such a national dialogue on the implications of Brexit and the optimal outcome for the island of Ireland that could be achieved in the context of negotiations between the Republic of Ireland, within the European Union and with the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>To be frank, that leaves aside the constitutional and political issues under the umbrella of the Good Friday Agreement, which should be dealt with separately.  I made it clear in my remarks at the weekend that there is no evidence now there has been any shift in terms of public opinion <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>a united Ireland, as per the Good Friday Agreement.  All the evidence up to the Brexit referendum was to the contrary and that public opinion was not moving in the direction of a united Ireland in previous polls.  It is important not to use Brexit as a kind of basis for an immediate Border poll or anything like that.  I just want to make it clear that my position on that has been very consistent and understood.  Much work must be done on that question.<br\/><br\/>On the Brexit issue itself, there is a very clear need for substantive dialogue, including with Scotland and others.  I do not believe the full implications of this have been readily understood.  As a former Minister, I went on trade missions to Scotland and we engaged with their universities.  They are particularly strong on research and the application of research to business ideas and industry.  It seems that many partnerships that have developed between Irish companies and companies in the UK or Northern Ireland could be in jeopardy as a result of Horizon 2020 funding being cut from partners in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  When in Brussels recently, the first person I met at the airport was a young person involved with a Northern Irish company who was very concerned about the partnership that had been developed.  Where do such people now stand in terms of funding?<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach got some criticism on the Scottish issue.  We need voices on the UK side to surface as they will suddenly realise the implications of this for them if some proper negotiating platform, broader than just a trade agreement, is embarked upon.  That needs to happen organically within the UK on issues like research, education, the Erasmus programme and so on, all of which could be cut off from young British people as a result of the decision to leave the European Union.  There are a panoply of issues beyond trade and many people in the UK would be anxious to have some continuing engagement with them in any new agreement arising between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<br\/><br\/>Will the Taoiseach indicate if he will take practical steps on the dialogue issue, including inviting in civil and social groups?  When can we expect a national conference or a plenary session of such stakeholders to take place and enable us to start the process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900021#T01900","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468941000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will see to it that Mr. Davis is contacted at an early stage to have the full range of our constitutional position fully outlined for him.  I will ask the relevant Minister to deal with that fairly quickly.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in Edinburgh at the last British-Irish Council, we spoke about the possibilities of increased business and trade between Ireland and Scotland before the decision.  The Deputy is aware that Scotland has opened an office in Dublin.  We will look at the question of beefing up the capacity in Edinburgh.  I was very impressed with their approach when I met people in Glasgow about the possibilities for Irish business.  The British-Irish Council meets in a special session in Cardiff this week on Friday to speak about the Brexit position, the Single Market and the CTA.  They will all be points of discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to think there will be an opportunity for everybody to have their say on this.  It may well be necessary to do it separately from the formalities of the Good Friday Agreement structure.  As I stated before, although there is no mandate from here to negotiate for Northern Ireland, it is very important that we have a responsibility as co-guarantor of the agreement to understand the challenges that Northern Ireland businesses and entrepreneurs feel they face arising from Brexit.  The Deputy is quite right in that many of these issues have not even been thought of in terms of how there will be an impact from the decision of the electorate to leave the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  When I was in Donegal yesterday, the point I was making was that when the Good Friday Agreement was drafted, people were long-sighted enough to put into the agreement a clause whereby a time might arrive - we are now 20 years on - when a secretary of state could invoke the clause on the basis of sufficient support for a Border poll.  That does not apply now because there is not sufficient support.  I make the point that in years to come, it may well be that with Britain having left the European Union and Northern Ireland having voted to stay in the European Union but remaining a member of the United Kingdom, there may be general negotiations and discussions.  The Deputy made the point, quite rightly, about Scotland wanting to join the European Union if it leaves the UK.  We should be able to make the arrangement on a long-term basis if it arises in future that a secretary of state triggers that clause, which will by then have been in the Good Friday Agreement for many years.  That is if Northern Ireland would want to extract itself from the United Kingdom to join a country that continued as a member of the European Union.  The only point I was making was that the discussions should be long-sighted and visionary enough to cater for that kind of issue if it happened.  I am not saying it will happen and I do not see any evidence of a Border poll now.  Some time in the future, they should not have to go through the process of a long drawn-out application to join the Republic, if that was the wish, but to be a member of the European Union as well.  These are the kinds of issues that should be encompassed in this.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy because under the Horizon 2020 programme we have 500 partnerships with Britain in universities, research, scientific analysis and so on.  This is very worrying as the Commission has informed some of those people that funding might not be likely to continue.  There are also many thousands of Irish students going to college in colleges of technology and universities in Britain, so the issue of what happens with them must be discussed.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the question of electricity supply.  Northern Ireland depends on the Republic of Ireland.  We have interconnections with gas.  These are important elements.  If Britain is to leave and no longer be subject to the regulations in so far as climate change is concerned or the other implications of EU directives, these will all need to be discussed.  We will also need to discuss what applies in terms of the law currently.  If there is a single island electricity market underpinned by legislation in Dublin or Westminster, when Britain leaves we presume the legislation will continue to be enforced.  In the longer term, part of the European Union philosophy is not to have any energy islands and we should be connected to mainland Europe.  Currently that connection comes through Britain with undersea and land connections.  These are all part of the dialogue we must have.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to think we could put the best possible proposition together to have that kind of discussion from political parties, non-governmental organisations, business people, trade unions and everybody else who wants to have a say.  We are working to devise what might be an appropriate operation to allow that to happen.  I hope we can do that in September but I will consult the leaders opposite for their views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900022#U00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1468941600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>On a point of order and the way questions are grouped, this was a question about discussions between the Taoiseach and the Scottish First Minister which interacted with a raft of further questions.

His reply was worth waiting for.<\/p><p>There was purpose to the question.  In light of the fantastic economic figures released last week, I thought we might be adjusting completely our social and public sector policies.  I am sure the Taoiseach read the article in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>last week.  It opened by stating:<\/p><blockquote>The Irish have written some notable works of fiction - James Joyce and Flann O'Brien produced imperishable classics.  Now there is a new addition to the national [canon] - the official narrative of the country's economy.  According to data released on Tuesday, it grew by 26.3 per cent last year.<\/blockquote><p>Arising from this and the previous Government's policy of creating a tax haven in the country and other such incentives for multinationals to locate here, we are now disguising the real economic figures and making ourselves an international laughing stock.  I do not know how the Taoiseach was greeted in Europe last week but the idea that there has been a 26% growth in the economy -  I do not know if even Soviet Russia in the 1930s exceeded these figures - means we have all now heard the phrase leprechaun economics being bandied around internationally.<\/p><p>Has the Taoiseach reconsidered this country's policy of having the lowest rate of corporation tax in Europe, particularly when we have the most acute housing emergency?  The Government has just released a plan which, unfortunately and sadly for those on housing lists, will continue to see people waiting up to 15 years to be housed and puts housing in the lap of the private sector.  Meanwhile in the real world, while these figures were making us a laughing stock, according to Social Justice Ireland the number of people living in poverty in Ireland has increased by more than 110,000.  Today, more than 750,000 people in the State live in poverty and 18% of adults with incomes below the poverty line are in employment.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach had a mantra during the election about making work pay.  In actual fact, work does not pay for a huge number of people in the country.  I am sure the Taoiseach has also noted the Low Pay Commission's derisory and insulting awarding of a 10 cent an hour increase to the minimum wage.  Many have commented that it would have been better if no increase had been awarded because a 10 cent increase just adds insult to injury.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his sacred policy of multinational domination of the economy?  The policy allows them to have brass plate operations here and to source so much of their operations here they are distorting economic figures.  It is now impossible to determine the rate of growth.<\/p><p>I will finish by mentioning the pursuit of Apple.  Will the Taoiseach now drop his opposition to the European Commission's pursuit of Apple for back taxes in this country?  These are estimated to amount to &euro;17 billion.  Imagine the houses we could build if we had &euro;17 billion to hand.  Will the Taoiseach consider bringing into effect the headline rate of corporation tax, which would increase our fiscal space of &euro;2 billion this year alone?  Those are the kinds of things we need to do to solve the housing crisis and not the kind of thing released earlier on today, which offers little hope to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900023#V01100","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1468941600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I do not accept the premise of Deputy Coppinger's response at all.  She states that we created a tax haven in the country.  We did no such thing.  Not only that, we have been very much upfront with the OECD in terms of the presentation of our corporate tax position.  We abolished the double Irish concept.  We got rid of the stateless concept.  We were the first country to have a fully compliant regime in terms of the OECD requirements for countries.  We have introduced the first fully OECD compliant knowledge development box with a tax rate of 6.25%.  We defend strongly our corporate tax rate of 12.5% and will continue to do so.  I note that other countries intend to reduce their corporate tax rate as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned last week's CSO figures.  We dealt with them.  Obviously, they do not reflect the average growth in the economy.  The figures were impacted by the scale of aircraft leasing in the country, contracted manufacturing in other countries where firms are based here in Ireland, the transfer of public limited companies, plcs, to Ireland and the transfer of significant amounts of intellectual property rights to the country.  These are all issues which impact on our economy, but clearly the figures produced last week do not impact in terms of job creation and job numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform has been dealing with quite a number of issues.  It is important to reflect on the benefits of a rising economy on social injustice, unfairness and inequality and to demonstrate that Government does care about the quality of people's lives.  My visits to the north inner city are a case in point.  Within 100 yards of the IFSC, I witnessed people who deal in misery for money on the streets.  Garda resources and facilities are needed to deal with these things and clean up these places.  We also need to help those who have been waylaid.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, we have protected the primary weekly social welfare rates.  We have put in place a proactive approach to helping those who are unemployed through the provision of Intreo offices.  We held a referendum on children's rights.  We strengthened child protection through the National Vetting Bureau.  We published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which is going through the legislative process now.  We launched the new junior cycle reforms.  We increased the time spent on literacy and numeracy skills in all primary schools and introduced a comprehensive action plan on bullying.  We ended the practice of sending 16 year olds to St. Patrick's Institution.  We published the national positive ageing strategy and the national dementia strategy.  We established the Child and Family Agency.  We increased provision for special needs assistants to 12,600 until the end of 2016, which is an increase of 2,300.  We put in place the Irish refugee protection programme to take in 4,000 persons to the country.  We approved amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act to give the Garda greater power to deal with the problem of illicit trade in street medicines.  We introduced a two-week period of paternity leave and associated social welfare payments.  Priorities for this year include the new model of in-school speech and language therapy and the implementation of the national plan for equality of access to higher education.  They also include expanding the preschool provision under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which will see the number of children benefiting rise from approximately 67,000 to 127,000 in the programme next year.  We published the Government's action plan for education inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example to Deputy Coppinger.  We have been dealing with the issue of resource teachers for years.  This is a sore point with people and rightly so because it means an awful lot to those for whom it should mean most - the students.  The model was developed by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, with Mr. Eamon Stack.  It was discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee twice under the last Government.  It was piloted in 47 schemes and the feedback has been positive.<\/p><p>We are going to roll it out nationally in a way that does not create any losers in the short term and at a once-off cost of &euro;72 million.  The situation in regard to some learning support schemes was wasteful and inequitable.  In one example, if school A has 250 students with ten needing learning support while school B has 250 students with 75 needing learning support, both would get the same level of learning support under the current system and that is inequitable, wasteful and harmful to those who do not get the necessary support.  We are changing all that with a model designed for Ireland by the NCSE which will eliminate that type of situation and will mean the accompanying stress and pressure will not be put on parents and children.  All these matters are important and reflect inequality, unfairness and social disadvantage so we must focus where we can on using the resources of a rising economy to deal with them.<\/p> <p> As I said to Deputy Adams on a previous occasion, there needs to be an output from this type of investment in order that we can help people.  Last week I met reformed alcoholics, reformed drug addicts and women who had suffered the most horrendous physical violence in their relationships and who have tried hard over the years to make a comeback and live their lives again.  We must and will continue to work in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900023#V01200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468942200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>That was a cook's tour of everything.

The Road Safety Authority, RSA, carried out a public consultation on the issue, following which draft provisions were developed for consideration.  Due to the complexity of the issues involved, the Department, working together with the RSA, agreed that legislation could only be progressed following legal advice and careful examination of how robust and effective any measures would be.  I am of the view that enabling legislation to provide for the regulation of written-off vehicles is an issue which requires action in the current Road Traffic Bill.  This Bill has passed all Stages in the Seanad and is due to be introduced in the D&aacute;il.

The term \"write-off\" refers to cars involved in crashes that are so seriously damaged that they either need major repairs done for them to be classed as roadworthy or should never appear back on the road.

I am grateful to Deputy Troy for addressing the matter in a wider form.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing capacity in our public transport system and improving the quality of public transport services is key to addressing congestion in the greater Dublin area.\u00a0 More than &euro;200 million has been allocated for investment in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area in 2016 under the capital plan.  The capital investment works currently being undertaken by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the greater Dublin area include the Luas cross city project, which is on schedule to open at the end of 2017; the Phoenix Park tunnel, which I expect to open for services later this year; the city centre re-signalling project; and investment in the bus fleet and bus priority measures.  These will greatly enhance the capacity of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area when completed.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, funding is being\u00a0allocated\u00a0to\u00a0a wide range of projects in the greater Dublin area aimed at developing sustainable transport modes such as cycling, walking and public transport.  Investment is also being made in integration measures designed to encourage the use of public transport, such as real-time passenger information, the Leap card, the national journey planner and on-board Wi-Fi.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area\u00a0for 2016 to 2035 sets out a comprehensive vision for public transport in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades.  The NTA is now drawing up an integrated implementation plan to outline how it will go about delivering the strategy's objectives over the first six-year period within the strategy's overall 20-year horizon.<\/p>  <p>  While investment in the public transport system is critical to addressing congestion, ultimately, a public transport response on its own cannot ensure\u00a0that there is a sustainable match between transport demand and transport supply.  Neither can\u00a0traffic management measures\u00a0or\u00a0additional roads investment achieve this in isolation.  Congestion can only be managed by combining all of these responses.

The capital plan that was published last September is very unambitious with regard to what will be delivered.  Meanwhile, we have the construction of cycle lanes.  The number of cars coming into the city is decreasing and the reduction is not being compensated for by ensuring the provision of public car parks on the outer roads.

If we want to get people into the capital city and moving freely around by way of public transport, cycling or walking, where are they to leave their cars when they commute?

It is something we are addressing as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for TII, under the Roads Act, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of local authorities, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended.  Works on these roads are funded from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each authority.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  As a result of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in the funding available for road expenditure over the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The capital plan, published in September 2015, outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  It provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects, including PPP already underway.  The transport element of the capital plan is based on a gradual buildup over the plan period in capital funding for the road network from the current relatively low base towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully recognise the importance of maintenance and renewal work on the roads, as Minister I have to work within the capital and current budgets available to my Department.  In view of the continuing constraints on State funding, my Department has emphasised to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating their resource income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900028#AA00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1468944600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct; it is the statutory responsibility of local authorities to maintain roads.

It is no wonder people are annoyed at the condition of the roads.  It is not just me: my colleague Deputy Michael McGrath has also tabled a question on road projects.  I met with a delegation of councillors from Monaghan who were infuriated with the condition of the roads.  It is not good enough to say it is the statutory responsibility of the local authorities.

The start of year capital and current expenditure allocation for 2016 is &euro;402 million.  The steep decline in expenditure on roads during that period spans several Administrations and several years.  It is inevitable at this stage that we are in a situation which is critical, admittedly, in certain places but it is not just the result of spendthrift or generous spending on roads at certain times in the past decade, it is also the result of the fact that as the Deputy is aware, we have an extraordinarily high number of roads, 100,000 km, which is amazing and is way above the EU average.

The sorry situation now is that many roads are unsafe because we have not invested enough in road restoration.  The figures the Minister outlined from 2007 to 2015 include new constructions.  We have not had new roads constructed in recent years but we have had a siphoning off of money raised from road tax for the establishment of what in the words of the Minister is a super quango, namely, Irish Water.

The fact that we have to spend so much money just on the maintenance of the roads because the network is so extensive is indicative of the problems, which is going to remain with us for a long period.

They will also be aware that there was no round of the sports capital programme in 2009, 2010 or 2011.  There were, however, rounds of the programme in 2012, 2014 and 2015.  Almost 1,600 applications were received under the 2015 round of the programme, evidence of its ongoing importance.

The Minister of State said that there were 1,600 applicants last year, which will give him an understanding of the level of interest in the sports grant application process.  He will also recognise how valuable these sports grants are to sporting clubs right across the State, particularly to sporting clubs and groups in disadvantaged areas.

The severe delay in the allocation of sports capital funding is now a major concern for various sports clubs and organisations that have been waiting for investment to progress with plans and proposals to upgrade or develop facilities for some time.  It is critical that the Government build on the many years of investment in this area.  As the Minister has indicated, he relaunched the scheme in 2012.  Many clubs, on the basis of having submitted an application on the first day, have now progressed plans to move on further.  The Minister of State also created the air of uncertainty.  He said he would take a special interest in this.  Judging from his response to a previous parliamentary question, I am sure his colleagues below in Killarney received a rush of expressions of interest.  Even that has created an air of uncertainty.  From a political point of view, it has to be acknowledged that money has been allocated to the Department.

I could not make it clearer that no decision has been made on this issue and that both the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I are committed to it.  I point to the years 2012 onwards in that regard.  The timeframe in which any allocation or announcement would be made allows the potential for something to happen in 2016.  The only confusion and uncertainty out there is, I think, generated by people who almost hope in a way that we might not be able to do it.  Our aspiration is that we will be able to do it.  The clubs are certainly looking for it, and individual sporting organisations have over the last number of months been engaging with the Department on an online basis anyway.

On the issue of driving in another jurisdiction on a temporary visitor basis the right to drive in another jurisdiction on a national licence is based on international road traffic conventions.  These allow people to drive in signatory countries for up to a year as visitors.  Ireland and the UK are parties to such conventions.  This will remain the case regardless of what EU-UK arrangements may emerge.

I am not sure who is the more formidable adversary in this House this time, but I will give her the same answer I would have given Deputy Wallace.  The Deputy will be aware that the daa holds statutory responsibility for the management, operation and development of Dublin Airport.  In line with this responsibility, it is a matter for the daa to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to facilitate the development of the airport and that there is sufficient capacity to meet existing and future demand.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the runway development was subject to a rigorous environmental impact assessment, EIA, as part of the full planning process.  At that time, the environmental impact statement, EIS, clearly stated that the impacts of the runway on carbon emission would not be significant and that mitigation measures such as improved aircraft engine efficiency, efficient airport operations and international climate agreements would address aviation carbon emissions.  I also note that the 2020 national reduction targets under EU Decision 406\/2009\/EC (Effort Sharing) do not include international aircraft emissions so the north runway project will not have any direct impact on these targets.<\/p>  <p>  Aviation emissions are to be addressed separately under an agreement reached at a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, in 2013 to establish a global market-based measure for aviation emissions.  It is anticipated that the details of that global scheme, which will apply from 2020, will be finalised at the ICAO general assembly in September 2016.  Currently, aviation emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, EEA, are subject to an emissions trading scheme known as the EU ETS scheme.  This scheme imposes a cap on the emissions of individual airlines such that all intra-EEA flights to and from Dublin Airport are covered by this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900033#FF00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1468947600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct in saying that the daa is responsible for airport development but the rigorous EIS that was carried out will be 13 years old by the time the new runway is operational in 2020.

There is a certain conflict in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the issues are very pertinent.  Aviation is responsible for about 5% of global carbon emissions.  In respect of best practice, some environmentalists would say that there should be a moratorium on usage.  If one looks at Dublin Airport, particularly post Brexit, one can see the number of passengers the airport now gets and the number it would need to offset the costs of the second runway that will inevitably drive up the number of flights and emissions.
