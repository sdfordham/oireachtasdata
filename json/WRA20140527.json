The section requires a Commencement Order, which has not been made.  Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval.  A pre-notification of state aid was made to the Commission on 20 February last.  The purpose of the pre-notification is to facilitate the easier passage of the measure through any formal State-aid notification.

It is the Central Bank's view, based on the feedback generated, that the MART as designed and implemented has supported an increased focus on long term solutions.  The Deputies will be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 30 April that, based on the information submitted for end-December 2013, the banks have proposed sufficient numbers of solutions to meet the targets of proposing solutions to 50% and concluding solutions for 15% of accounts in arrears greater than 90 days. <\/p><p>  The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for the six MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.\u00a0 The latest publication, in respect of the end of March, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.\u00a0 For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December to around 62,000 in March 2014.\u00a0 This data, as well as the Central Bank quarterly mortgage arrears publications, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that its MART publication of March 2013 clearly indicates that where a lender relies on legal action to address an arrears situation it must be able to demonstrate that an alternative arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate.  It is important to point out that in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, the strong view of Government is that repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.\u00a0 My officials in their regular meetings with the lenders have expressed the clear view of Government that the lenders should make every effort to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.<\/p><p>  It will now be necessary to build on the measures implemented by Government such as the reform of the insolvency service process, the mortgage advisory service and the mortgage to rent scheme.\u00a0 The issue of mortgage arrears is a major problem that needs to be resolved, not only for an individual borrower, but also for the long term economic and social health of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU State Aid Negotiations","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[23034\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the length of time it takes the European Commission to approve budget day announcements which are subject to state aid rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

For example, in 2006, Ireland demonstrated its commitment and leadership in the area of debt relief by contributing its full financial share of over &euro;116 million to the two main multilateral initiatives to address debt relief, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, while other States opted to pay for this debt cancellation over a much longer period and in smaller instalments.  Furthermore, Ireland has pledged its share of the profits from recent IMF gold sales, totalling 12.94 million SDR (Special Drawing Rights), the asset reserve used by the IMF, which equates to some &euro;15 million.  This will subsidise lending to low-income countries, which may currently borrow at zero interest from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), the IMF's concessional lending vehicle.<\/p><p>  As more and more countries graduate from the multilateral debt relief initiatives, the question of how they can maintain their debt at sustainable levels has become more relevant.\u00a0 It is for this reason that Ireland contributes &euro;100,000 annually to the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System programme operated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and which provides software solutions and technical assistance to developing countries to manage their debt sustainably.<\/p><p>  As the Caribbean countries are not priority countries for Irish Aid -which supports the world's poorest countries, focusing in particular on sub-Saharan Africa - there is not a specific focus on the Caribbean region. \u00a0However, Ireland has been supportive of the Caribbean countries, particularly those dealing with emergencies, and has contributed to a number of funds established for these humanitarian causes.

It now appears that this will be the form of the initial tax measure that is being considered by the participating countries.  This means that in effect these countries, some of which do not apply any financial transactions tax currently, are now considering a tax along the lines of that which already applies in Ireland, the UK and certain other countries.  The rate at which such transactions would be charged remains to be finalised but it was proposed in the draft Directive that transactions in shares would be subject to a charge of 0.1%, which is\u00a0lower than that which currently applies in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[22225\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will revise tax reliefs for pensions in order to encourage the investment of funds here.

The position from a tax perspective is that the investment income and gains of pension schemes and pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners are generally exempt from taxation while they remain in the scheme or arrangement.  This tax exempt treatment of investment growth together with the exemption from tax on ongoing contributions paid into pension funds are intended to encourage individuals to provide themselves with an adequate income in retirement.<\/p><p>  It is not clear from the question what changes to the current tax relief arrangements the Deputy has in mind.  She might note, however, that trustees of pension schemes have a duty under trust law, the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, and Investment Regulations made under that Act to be prudent in the management of pension scheme assets having regard to the liabilities that must be met by the schemes and to structure the investment of those assets, accordingly.  In essence, this means that pension trustees, in particular, and those to whom they may delegate the responsibility for managing pension scheme assets or pension savings, generally, must invest solely in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.  Moreover, the general tax exemption for pension fund investment returns which I have described does not distort or influence decisions as between investments and I have no plans to change the tax relief system in a manner that would.  In addition, changes to tax relief arrangements that would favour pension fund investment in Ireland over such investment in other EU States could give rise to compliance issues under EU law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[23037\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether revenue to the State from the sale of solid fuel products is being put at risk from the significant cross-Border price differential that exists since the recent increase in the rate of carbon tax which applies to such products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.<\/p><p>  In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State.  Compliance with the Regulations is being enforced by local authorities.  A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal.  This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards.  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.<\/p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.  Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but\u00a0I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012\/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st   May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2. <\/p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the provisional yield returned for SFCT from 1st May 2013 to 31 December 2013 was &euro;7.3 million, ahead of the forecast yield for that period of &euro;6 million.

To achieve this, the SBCI will operate as a higher tier lender, providing funds to on-lending institutions.  On-lending institutions will include Irish commercial banks and could also include foreign banks, specialist funds and other finance houses engaged in lending activities.  Credit is the lifeblood of all businesses and SMEs will now be able to access loans of greater duration, with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost facilitated by the SBCI and its on-lending partners.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board's rental index, which provides a geographical breakdown of trends in the residential rental market, shows that monthly rent levels were up by 7.6 per cent on a mix-adjusted basis in Dublin in the year to Q4 2013.

It is a matter for the Agency to decide when and how much to borrow in the light of those needs, commercial considerations surrounding the raising of debt on the markets and the need to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.  All monies raised through Government debt borrowing are paid into the Central Fund\u00a0and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas.  \u00a0<\/p><p>That said, there are a number of options available to individuals who wish to help support the Government's work in promoting economic growth and employment.  The National Solidarity Bonds were introduced to provide a wider range of options for retail investors.  The Minister for Finance in announcing Budget 2010 launched the 10-year National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which was to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment.  Following the success of the launch of the ten-year National Solidarity Bond a four-year National Solidarity Bond was launched in 2011.  \u00a0<\/p><p>The NTMA's other State Savings products, available through any Post Office, allow people to support the Exchequer through Savings Bonds, Savings Certificates and Instalment Savings.  There are also possibilities in place for people interested in investing in longer-term Government bonds.  Irish sovereign bonds are available through seventeen Primary Dealers recognised by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  The NTMA has published information on their website () which gives the names and contact details for institutions which sell bonds to the public, and the fees they charge.  \u00a0<\/p><p>The NTMA will continue to encourage personal savers to purchase the National Solidarity Bonds and all the other NTMA State Savings products.  The NTMA keeps the suite of State Savings products and the interest rates paid on them under constant review to ensure that the products remain competitive and attractive to retail investors.  These products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances.  \u00a0<\/p><p>I am happy to confirm that the Government remains committed to exploring alternative means of financing capital projects.  The recently published Construction Strategy includes a commitment that a High Level Working Group chaired by my Department will be established to explore the issue of sustainable bank and non-bank financing options for the construction sector.  In addition the Government has announced the creation of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy.  Within its existing statutory investment policy and in line with the ISIF announcement, the NPRF has undertaken a number of investments and initiatives under which NPRF capital will be invested on a commercial basis in Ireland.\u00a0 The NPRF has in particular committed to invest in infrastructure (&euro;250 million) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects (&euro;118 million).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA04650"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[22176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review capital gains tax reliefs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I have no plans at this time to carry out a general review of existing capital gains tax reliefs.  In recognition of the economic climate in recent years I and previous Ministers for Finance have sought to obtain an additional contribution from capital gains tax by increasing the rate as outlined in the following table.<\/p><p><b>Disposals Made<\/b><table><tr><th>Date<\/th><th>Percentage<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>on or before 14 October 2008 <\/td><td>20%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>from 15 October 2008 to 7 April 2009<\/td><td>22%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>from 8 April 2009 to 6 December 2011<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>from 7 December 2011 to 5 December 2012<\/td><td>30%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>from 6 December 2012 onwards <\/td><td>33% <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Capital gains tax is one of a suite of taxes that plays an important role in the overall taxation system in place in Ireland.  In terms of equity, it is appropriate that those who make capital gains should make a contribution in tax terms so that the entire tax burden does not only significantly fall on those who pay income taxes.  Capital gains tax also plays a role in mitigating opportunities for tax avoidance by discouraging the conversion of income into capital gains to reduce tax liability.<\/p><p>Reliefs play an important role in relation to most taxes and capital gains tax is no different in this regard.  Targeted business related capital gains tax reliefs are provided principally to ensure that business, while paying its share of capital gains tax, is not unduly hampered in terms of developing and growing its business or in passing on businesses to the next generation of business people.\u00a0 The following capital gains tax reliefs are all geared towards assisting business:<\/p><p>- Appropriation to and from stock in trade (section 596 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997)<\/p><p>- Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997) (subject to a commencement order due to requirement for EU State Aid approval)<\/p><p>- Retirement relief (sections 598\/599 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>- Transfer of business to a company (section 600 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>- Replacement of Qualifying Premises (certain rented residential premises (section 600A, TCA 1997) [now only available in limited circumstances]<\/p><p>- Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997)<\/p><p>- Disposals to authority possessing compulsory powers (section 605 TCA 1997)<\/p><p>- Transfer of assets on company reconstructions or amalgamation (section 615 TCA 1997<\/p><p>- Reliefs in relation to inter-group company transactions (sections 617 et seq.).<\/p><p>All reliefs are reviewed periodically and maintained, adjusted or abolished by reference to the circumstances that exist at the time relative to those that gave rise to their introduction.\u00a0\u00a0Take Roll-over relief (Section 597), for example.  Roll-over relief was introduced in 1975 when capital gains tax was first enacted.  It allowed chargeable gains on disposals of business assets to be deferred provided the proceeds of disposal were reinvested in new business assets.\u00a0 This relief was reviewed and was removed in Finance Act 2003 from 4 December 2002 onwards, except in the case of eligible taxpayers who had rolled-over assets prior to that date.  The abolition of rollover relief in late 2002 must be seen in the context of the introduction at that time of the single 12.5% rate of corporation tax on trading profits.Another example of a business relief that was reviewed and amended is the capital gains tax farm retirement relief which was amended in Finance (No 2) Act 2013.  This was extended to allow relief to a farmer who farmed for 10 years, has no children to whom to pass on the land, and who lets the farm for a period following retirement from active farming before ultimately disposing of the land.  Prior to this such a farmer would not have been entitled to retirement relief.<\/p><p>Certain reliefs are introduced from time to time with a view to achieving a particular objective in particular circumstances.\u00a0 Examples of such reliefs include:<\/p><p>- relief for certain disposals of land and buildings (section 604A TCA 1997 -introduced by section 64, Finance Act 2012).  This short-term relief was introduced to provide a stimulus to the property market at a time when there was virtually no activity in it.  The intention being that the impact would be both direct (on estate agents, surveyors, etc) and indirect (on construction related activities) as well as encouraging the sale of commercial premises and long term investment in productive assets, thereby assisting in the creation of longer term employment.  This is a targeted relief which only applies to certain land and buildings acquired during the period 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  Any such property acquired must be held for 7 years in order to qualify for full relief.  Any disposal within the 7 year period gets no relief.<\/p><p>- Relief for farm restructuring (section 604B TCA 1997   introduced by section 48, Finance Act 2013).  This relief was identified as desirable to assist farmers to become more viable by enabling them to restructure their land holdings without incurring a capital gains tax.\u00a0 This relief is a more focused form of relief than the more general roll-over relief that was in the main abolished from 4 December 2002.<\/p><p>- Entrepreneur relief (section 597A TCA 1997,introduced by section 45 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).  This is a CGT relief for individuals who reinvest the proceeds of previous asset disposals into new business ventures.  The commencement of this relief is subject to EU State Aid approval.<\/p><p>Lastly, I announced in my Budget 2014 speech, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that I would commission a review of tax reliefs available to farming.  This review will include CGT reliefs available to farming.  Any recommendations of the review will be considered in the context of Budget 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700051#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Schemes","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB00075"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[23036\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB00100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the introduction of a State-backed insurance scheme for first-time buyers in the absence of a significant increase in supply in the short to medium term will lead to an unsustainable rise in property prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Eurogroup meeting on 20 June 2013 agreed on the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI).  There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that \"The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.\"  Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. <\/p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting on 5 May 2014 considered a proposed resolution to the outstanding issues on the operational framework of the ESM's DRI put forward by the Eurogroup President, Mr Dijsselbloem.  This proposal was broadly supported and is expected to be put to the Eurogroup on 19 June 2014 for a decision.  After this national approval procedures must be completed.  It will not be possible to apply for the DRI until it is in effect.  The DRI will come into effect once the SSM is in place and operational.  This is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year.<\/p><p>  Finally, both I and my Government colleagues will ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.\u00a0 I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Stress Tests","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[15987\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has seen the letter sent from Mr. Mario Draghi in relation to EU-wide stress tests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In particular I note that Mr Draghi has highlighted that the Balance Sheet Assessment completed in 2013 by the Central Bank of Ireland is different to the SSM comprehensive assessment as it was not forward looking and did not include a\u00a0stress test.  The Deputy will be aware that the SSM comprehensive assessment comprises three components:<\/p><p>  \u00a0- A supervisory risk assessment;<\/p><p>  \u00a0- An asset quality review (AQR); and, <\/p><p>  \u00a0- A stress test.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding Mr Draghi's comments in relation to the difference between the two exercises, the AQR component of the SSM comprehensive assessment\u00a0is similar to the Balance Sheet Assessment completed by our own Central Bank and is the starting point for the stress test.  At the conclusion of the Balance Sheet Assessment it was confirmed that, having recognised additional provisions, each of the banks'\u00a0capital ratios were above the minimum regulatory requirement.  This, together with\u00a0the large amount of new capital that has gone into the banks in recent years, leaves\u00a0our banks well positioned going into the\u00a0SSM comprehensive assessment and stress tests.<\/p><p>  I also note that Mr Draghi makes reference to the\u00a0&quot;still very large stock of non-performing loans&quot; which is a matter we have clearly been focused on for several years.\u00a0 I take comfort in this regard\u00a0in the progress of each of the banks\u00a0in achieving the resolution targets set by the Central Bank for both residential mortgage and SME exposures.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Finally, Mr Draghi refers to &quot;the completion of the banks' restructuring and reforms&quot;.

Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of the FTT would have a significantly negative effect on Sovereign Debt Markets and may impair the good-functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for States.<\/p><p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst the Member States, including some of the participating countries.\u00a0 These concerns have led to the recent issuing of a communique by the\u00a0participating Member States, announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives.  However, significant technical and legal discussions will continue to be required at the Council Working Party before\u00a0the text of the proposed Directive can be finalised.  With this in mind, the targeted implementation date for the FTT has been rescheduled to 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland already has a tax on certain financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.\u00a0 The\u00a0yield from this charge in 2013 is estimated to be just above &euro;250 million. It now appears that this will be the form of the initial financial transaction tax measure that is being considered by the participating countries.  This means that in effect these countries, some of which do not apply any financial transactions tax currently, are now considering a tax along the lines of that which already applies in Ireland, the UK and certain other countries.  The rate at which such transactions would be charged remains to be finalised but it was proposed in the draft Directive that transactions in shares would be subject to a charge of 0.1%, which is\u00a0much lower than that which currently applies in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[23024\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the various economic indicators are positively positioned in the run-up to budget 2015; the extent to which he expects to be in a position to continue to meet the conditions laid down by the troika and at the same time address the specific issues likely to have a socioeconomic impact; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The data\u00a0flow in the opening months of this year have been encouraging.\u00a0 Sales in the retail sector were up\u00a0by around 8 per cent in the first quarter\u00a0when compared with the same period last year,\u00a0with\u00a0core sales (which excludes motor trades) up\u00a0by around 2 per cent in the quarter.\u00a0 This has been\u00a0supported by a\u00a0strenthening in  consumer confidence.\u00a0 The\u00a0ESRI\/KBC consumer sentiment indicator\u00a0was at its\u00a0highest level in over\u00a0seven years in April, while\u00a0the unemployment rate, having peaked at over 15 per cent in early 2012, remains on a downward trajectory, falling to\u00a011.7 per cent in April.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Having decided to maintain the tourism VAT rate at 9 per cent\u00a0as part of Budget 2014, I am particularly encouraged to see that\u00a0positive momentum in\u00a0the sector in 2013 appears to have carried into this year, with\u00a0trips to Ireland up by 7.3 per cent in the first quarter when compared with the same period\u00a0 last year.<\/p><p>  Developments in the construction sector have been equally encouraging in the year to date, with PMI data suggesting that\u00a0activity in the sector expanded at is fastest pace since January 2006 in March, marking a seventh successive month of expansion for the sector.  No sector was harder hit by the economic downturn than the construction sector and the Government remains committed to supporting\u00a0a continued recovery in construction in the years ahead.

We left the EU-IMF programme at the end of last year\u00a0having\u00a0put in place the structural reforms required to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.

While the Government's main focus since coming to office has been on job creation and economic recovery, we have also used our time in office to set about making some long overdue reforms to our parliament.  The extensive packages of Oireachtas reforms introduced since this Government took office in March 2011 are designed to improve the working of the Irish parliament. <\/p><p>The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of the D&aacute;il recesses and introducing additional sitting days.  A comparison of sitting days between this Government's first three years in office, when the D&aacute;il sat 372 days, and the first three years in office of the previous FF, Green &amp;amp; PD coalition, when the D&aacute;il sat 286 days, shows an increase of 86 sitting days.<\/p><p>The first phase of the D&aacute;il Reform Programme was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included:<\/p><p>&middot;An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste<\/p><p>&middot;Topical Issue Debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment Debates to give TDs an opportunity to raise issues directly with Ministers from the relevant Department.<\/p><p>&middot;Friday sittings to allow TDs to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il<\/p><p>&middot;An appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a TD is unhappy with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question<\/p><p>&middot;A Pre-Legislative review system where Ministers could give the Heads of a Bill to the Oireachtas Committee to review the issue before the legislation was published.<\/p><p>&middot;Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16 and providing a system of pre-legislative review.<\/p><p>In the summer of 2012 further reforms to the Oireachtas Committee system were introduced which streamlined the structure and allowed additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.<\/p><p>In September 2013 the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Government Chief Whip announced the second phase of D&aacute;il Reforms proposed by the Government and the D&aacute;il debated and approved changes to Standing Orders in October 2013.  These reforms are being phased in over a period of time, with the first reforms being introduced in November 2013 and other reforms being phased in since then.<\/p><p>The changes will allow more public involvement in the law making process:<\/p><p>- A Pre-Legislative Stage before an Oireachtas Committee is now a requirement for all non-emergency legislation.<\/p><p>- A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage will be required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>- This allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law making.  The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups and crucially, this will take place before the legislation is drafted.<\/p><p>- Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill.<\/p><p>A new system which requires the Government to outline its priorities to the D&aacute;il on an annual basis has now been introduced.  The first such debate was held earlier this year.  It includes:<\/p><p>- The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste addressing the D&aacute;il setting out the Government's annual priorities.<\/p><p>- Each Minister also addressing the D&aacute;il setting out their Department's plans for the future.<\/p><p>- The Government will publish a number of supporting documents for the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has been expanded: <\/p><p>- In April the Stability Programme Update is presented to the EU and Committees can review this and report before the Budget in October.  <\/p><p>- The Budget and Spending Estimates will be published in October and Committees will scrutinise the Budget and the Estimates earlier.<\/p><p>The use of the guillotine has now been reduced by introducing a new system of drafting and enactment of legislation, including a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year, and increasing the time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il by extending the sitting day and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesday and Thursday.  To date in 2014 the guillotine has not been used in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The way legislation in the Chamber is debated has been improved:<\/p><p>- At First Stage the proposer of a Private Member's Bill now has 5 minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain their reasons for drafting the legislation.<\/p><p>- At Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage shall have a speaking slot, of the same length as the Minister or Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on its findings.<\/p><p>- At the end of the second stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies chosen by the Ceann Comhairle who had previously spoken. <\/p><p>The Friday sittings have been expanded:<\/p><p>- The D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bill and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system.  This expansion of the Friday sittings has been introduced as a result of the growth, from 16 in 2011 to 58 in 2013, in the number of Private Member's Bills being published by TDs since the introduction of Friday sittings from 16 in 2011 to 58 in 2013.  The D&aacute;il will now debate three or perhaps four Private Members' Bills each month.<\/p><p>- The new Friday sittings also allow Committees to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il for the first time.<\/p><p>- A Minister or Minister of State will speak during the debate to outline the Government's response.<\/p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply and if this is not the case the TD who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister from that Department is available, when it will be given priority.<\/p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes.  An ordinary oral question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached and the Deputy will be given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. <\/p><p>A new system of Post Legislative Review will be introduced requiring a Minister to report to the relevant Oireachtas Committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of the Act. <\/p><p>The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 has been passed and the Standing Orders necessary to establish Oireachtas Inquiries put in place by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Both Houses have now passed motions to establish a Joint Committee to set up a Banking inquiry, which will be the first Oireachtas Inquiry under the new legislation.<\/p><p>No parliament is perfect and the process of parliamentary reform is always an ongoing one.  The Oireachtas Reforms announced last autumn are currently being implemented but work is already underway on the next phase of D&aacute;il Reform.  The next phase will build on the changes introduced since the Government took office in 2011 and focus on the outstanding commitments in this area in the Programme for Government. <\/p><p>Any Member of the House who has D&aacute;il reform proposals can contact the Government Chief Whip to discuss those proposals in detail and they will be considered as part of the ongoing process of D&aacute;il reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Boston College Archives","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[22178\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the release of the Boston College papers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[22705\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700052#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views regarding threats and use of provocative labels such as touts\u00a0being made against persons who co-operated with the Boston College tapes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am also appalled by the reported abduction of a further 11 girls on 4 May.  Through our development policies and programmes, Ireland is a strong supporter of the rights of women and girls, and in particular the right of girls to education.  I have given my full support to the demands of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, that the girls be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I welcome the support now being provided to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the US, to help find the missing schoolgirls.  I also welcome the decision on 22 May by the UN Security Council Al Qaida Sanctions Committee to impose financial sanctions and an arms embargo on Boko Haram.  The primary responsibility to secure the safe release of the school girls rests with the Nigerian authorities.  I urge the Government of Nigeria to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to ensure that the girls can return safely to their families, and to education.  <\/p><p>  At its meeting in Brussels on 12 May, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions expressing the EU's concern at the recent terrorist attacks in northern Nigeria and the suffering caused to the population.  The Council strongly condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls and called for their immediate and unconditional release.  It underlined the EU's readiness to support the Nigerian authorities in the resolution of this despicable crime and their ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, in full respect of human rights.  The EU is already supporting the Nigerian authorities to strengthen their capacity to provide security and combat terrorism.  An EU support programme to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of terrorist suspects will begin later this month.  It will include EU technical assistance to counter violent extremism and radicalisation.  <\/p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja is working closely with our EU partners and others on the ground and maintaining contact with the Nigerian authorities in their efforts to locate and free the missing schoolgirls.  Officials from my Department have also been in contact with the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin to express concern at the ongoing situation and to request regular updates on the actions by the Nigerian authorities to recover the abducted schoolgirls. <\/p><p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2014, Ireland highlighted attacks by Boko Haram during discussions with the UN Special Representatives for Violence against Children and Children and Armed Conflict.

This is a joint venture with An Post which enables applicants to lodge applications through some 1,000 post offices across the country and some 70 post offices in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Passport Service endeavours to return a passport to all those who submitted properly completed applications through Passport Express within 10 working days.  82% of Passport Express Applications were processed within 10 days during 2013.  However passport demand in Ireland is seasonal.  Almost 50% of all passport applications are received in the four months April &ndash;July.  Notwithstanding the best efforts to plan in advance for such seasonal pressures, spikes in demand can still occur.  In particular this year two sharp peaks in demand as a result of naturalisation ceremonies occurred in January and March when approximately 8,000 new Irish citizens applied for their passports within a relatively short period of time.  Moreover, on 7 May, the Passport Service received nearly 7,000 applications which is the single largest daily recorded intake of passport applications in the history of the state.  Inevitably this has resulted in some delays in passport turnaround times.  The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.<\/p><p>  In an effort to improve the delivery of Passport Express and other services, the Passport Service has taken additional measures to deal with these short delays and the current increase in demand for the summer holiday season.

Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea a coastal state has exclusive rights within its EEZ over fishing (although all EU member states have transferred their competence for conservation and management of sea fisheries to the EU), the production of energy from water and wind, the protection of the marine environment and the conduct of marine scientific research.  A coastal state also enjoys exclusive sovereign rights to the recovery of oil and gas from the seabed beneath the EEZ, although this is governed by the separate legal regime of the continental shelf.<\/p><p>  The Maritime Jurisdiction (Boundaries of Exclusive Economic Zone) Order 2014 was made by the Government on 11 February last and, together with the Continental Shelf (Designated Areas) Order 2014 made on the same day, gives effect to the 'Agreement between the Irish and British Governments establishing a single maritime boundary between the Exclusive Economic Zones and continental shelves of Ireland and the UK', signed by the British Ambassador and myself in Dublin on 28 March 2013.  A map of the new boundaries is set out in the annex to the Agreement and I have sent a map to the Deputy directly.  The 2013 Agreement was necessary because, although Ireland and the UK negotiated an agreement on continental shelf boundaries in 1988, no agreement on the EEZ boundaries above the continental shelf was attempted at that time.  The two countries' declared EEZs therefore overlapped at the edges.  The new Agreement establishes the agreed 1988 continental shelf boundaries as the boundaries for both the continental shelf and the EEZs above, with some small technical adjustments necessary to take account of the 200 nautical mile EEZ limit.  <\/p><p>  The Agreement brings legal certainty to boundary issues.  This in turn will improve the protection of fisheries.  While EU member states have transferred competence to the EU for the conservation and management of sea fisheries they remain responsible for enforcement of EU fisheries law within their own jurisdictions.  Under the new Agreement therefore it will now be clear which State is responsible for law enforcement in EEZ areas that previously overlapped.  Likewise there will now be clarity about which state is responsible for licensing renewable energy projects within EEZ boundary areas and for protecting the marine environment in those areas.  <\/p><p>  Following the making of the two Government Orders the Agreement entered into force on 31 March 2014.

For Ireland an overriding priority for the partnership, and one which informed our participation in Mexico, is to renew momentum on strengthening aid effectiveness at country level.  Ireland has a strong record on making aid more effective, on harmonising and aligning our aid behind the development efforts of our partner countries.  This has been recognized clearly by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee.  A continuing commitment to aid effectiveness is a key element of the Government's policy on international development, One World One Future.<\/p><p>  The progress that has been made in delivering on the principles and commitments of effectiveness since the Paris Declaration has improved the impact of aid and strengthened partner countries' own development efforts.  Joining donor support together behind national policies and programmes and using it to strengthen country systems has been critical to achieving the enormous progress we have seen in improved health and education services, in effectively dealing with the challenge of HIV and AIDS and in the greater efficiency, oversight and accountability of public expenditure and services.<\/p><p>  However, our experience at country level since the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in 2011 shows that, in some contexts, the momentum behind the effectiveness agenda has waned.  The quality of dialogue has declined; mutual accountability mechanisms seem to be less important, there are fewer examples of joint programmes and collective analysis and a risk of increasing fragmentation of development efforts.  The emphasis on development results is often being understood as solely about donors' domestic accountability, rather than also as a means of strengthening partner country systems' ability to deliver development results for their citizens.<\/p><p>  With this in mind, I hosted an event at the Mexico meeting, at which an initiative was launched by Ireland, Mozambique, Finland and Switzerland to develop and implement a Joint Agenda for Action to renew momentum on effectiveness in Mozambique.  The objective of this event was to build on the relationships and structures that have been put in place, to further strengthen Mozambique's development cooperation architecture, which already involves donors, Government and civil society, and to adapt it to better deliver on the principles adopted at Busan in 2011.<\/p><p>  The Joint Agenda for Action will consist of a number of measures, to be implemented over the next two years that will:<\/p><p>  - Enhance national Ownership and Leadership of development cooperation partnerships<\/p><p>  - Focus Results and Policy Dialogue on national development priorities<\/p><p>  - Incentivise, and better specify, Accountability and Transparency<\/p><p>  - Build a more Inclusive Partnership by opening up existing mechanisms to new players.<\/p><p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Mozambique will work closely with the Government of Mozambique in supporting the implementation of this initiative in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700053#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[23193\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"in view of the recent National Commemoration of the Irish Famine, and Ireland's own experience with famine, if he will address the ongoing failure of the international community to deliver aid to those starving to death in Syria as caused by the Assad's regime policy of starve\/surrender; if he will insist that aid is delivered across Syria's borders to hundreds of thousands of Syrians in need of food; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>Our National Famine commemoration, as well as marking a very tragic and deeply important part of our history, also serves as an opportunity to remind ourselves that famine is still a contemporary issue in the world today, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people who live with food insecurity and hunger.  One such example is Syria where the protracted and tragic conflict has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need.  Access to food, water, electricity and medical supplies has been interrupted in areas witnessing armed activities. A growing number of family breadwinners have become unemployed and soaring food and fuel prices across the country have exacerbated the situation.  As the number of fatalities surpasses an estimated 150,000 people, there are now over 9.3 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.8 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries. The conflict has been characterised by ongoing and persistent violations, by all parties to the conflict, of international humanitarian and human rights law, including the denial of humanitarian access to those in need. UN Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted in February 2014, expressly demands that all parties &ndash; and, in particular the Syrian authorities, promptly allow rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, including across conflict lines and borders, to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches people in need. The Resolution further calls upon all parties to lift the sieges of populated areas and recalls the prohibition under international humanitarian law of the starvation of civilians as an instrument of combat. <\/p><p>  The second Report of the UN Secretary General on the implementation of this Resolution, presented to the Security Council on 23 April, highlighted the ongoing issue of limited humanitarian access, despite the related demands made to both the Syrian Government and armed opposition groups and noted that none of the parties to the conflict have adhered to the demands of the Council. In her subsequent briefing to the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, noted that, in the two months since the adoption of the Resolution, &lsquo;far from getting better, the situation is getting worse&rsquo;. USG Amos noted, in particular, the continued denial of humanitarian access to populations in need by all parties to the conflict.<\/p><p>  Despite the immense constraints on their operations, humanitarian agencies continue to work to provide life-saving assistance to the beleaguered Syrian population. In a one month period between March and April, food assistance for 4.1 million people was dispatched by the World Food Programme, an increase of 11% on the previous month. However, obstacles to humanitarian access in besieged and hard-to-reach areas &ndash; home to almost 4 million of Syria&rsquo;s citizens &ndash; only allowed for the delivery of food assistance to some 300,000 people. <\/p><p>  For our part, Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and we are one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment to Syria and the region over the period 2011 to 2014 amounts to over &euro;26 million. <\/p><p>  I have already approved the release of &euro;9 million towards this pledge, bringing our contribution to date to over &euro;23 million. Of this &euro;9 million, almost &euro;4 million is for operations within Syria, of which almost &euro;3 million is specifically for food assistance. <\/p><p>  Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians. On 22 May, Ireland joined with our EU partners, as well as a number of other UN Member States, in co-sponsoring a Security Council Resolution to refer the conflict in Syria to the International Criminal Court to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian assistance in Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[23212\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"considering Armenia&rsquo;s decision to turn away from the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership initiative and join the Russian-led Customs Union, the specific bilateral engagements his Department had with the Armenian Government; and if he discussed the issue of Armenian-EU relations with his European counterparts.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department met representatives from the Armenian Embassy last October, following the decision by President Sargsyan that Armenia would join the Eurasian Customs Union, and would not proceed with the initialling of an Association Agreement with the European Union.

The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and also includes the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises.  However, the credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  When first proposed in Budget 2014 it was initially estimated that the changes would yield around &euro;18 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in a full year. However, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, which allowed a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it to surrender it to a secondary carer, the expected yield is now estimated at &euro;16 million in 2014 and &euro;23 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  It is essential to regularly review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the OPFTC.  It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the OPFTC played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.

We are endeavouring to obtain legal certainty on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation and this will be made publicly available in due course.  At this time, I propose to set out the position as it currently stands.<\/p><p>Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland,\u00a0the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.\u00a0 The Central Bank is in\u00a0contact with the\u00a0MFSA\u00a0in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited,\u00a0the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information.<\/p><p>Setanta was regulated at\u00a0EU regulatory level in accordance with a\u00a0directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events. I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU\u00a0law is, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following\u00a0negotiations that were completed at European\u00a0level in November, 2013,\u00a0a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department and the Central Bank will\u00a0be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened. The European Commission has indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.<\/p><p>On\u00a016 April 2014, Setanta\u00a0determined that the company was insolvent. This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.\u00a0Setanta\u00a0was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and Mr Paul Mercieca was appointed as Liquidator. Officials from my Department together with officials\u00a0from the Central Bank\u00a0met\u00a0with the Liquidator and his\u00a0representatives in Ireland\u00a0on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders. The Liquidator confirmed that all policyholders\u00a0who have not already done so should arrange alternative cover without delay as claims are unlikely to be paid in full and he has commenced issuing letters to policyholders informing them that their insurance cover will be cancelled within 7 to 10 days, in accordance with their policy documents. <\/p><p>In the circumstances, I would\u00a0strongly advise\u00a0policyholders that it is no longer in their best interest\u00a0to maintain policies with Setanta as the company is\u00a0not in a position to meet claims in full.\u00a0 This is in order to\u00a0avoid\u00a0prolonging\u00a0a situation where policyholders would continue to drive vehicles insured by Setanta in circumstances where their potential claims are unlikely to be paid in full.  The Central Bank also strongly recommends that Setanta Policyholders should make alternative insurance arrangements without delay to avoid this situation and they have advised that they should contact their insurance broker or an insurer directly without delay to seek alternative cover.<\/p><p>The provision of motor insurance cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.<\/p><p>The Liquidator\u00a0has advised that\u00a0arrangements are in hand for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonuses&quot; certificates from Setanta.  Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates will be honoured by other insurers and we are aware that many insurers are being flexible surrounding requirements for documents.<\/p><p>In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement'\u00a0is available to policyholders of Setanta.\u00a0 The current Declined Cases Agreement was drawn up in 1981 and is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland. I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he\/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.\u00a0 I understand that Insurance Ireland\u00a0is also making information available to\u00a0those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through\u00a0their service at\u00a0(01) 676 1914 or by email at\u00a0.<\/p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.  The officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.<\/p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation\u00a0which was established by Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland.\u00a0The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.  The question of issuing an instruction to MIBI does not arise.  However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the\u00a0Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).<\/p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the\u00a0ICF.  All ICF\u00a0payments are subject to the limit of\u00a065% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF. <\/p><p>The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. However, unpaid premium would fall to be claimed from the Setanta Liquidator in due course.\u00a0 I do not, at this time, have plans to waive the insurance levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[22185\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700054#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive the tax refund they are due.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that correspondence was received from the taxpayer by Revenue in March 2013, requesting issue of a Tax Credit Certificate to the taxpayer's then employer.

These restrictions are in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until a credit union has addressed particular concerns advised to that credit union. The recent publication of the Central Bank's first PRISM risk assessment report on credit unions highlights issues identified in a number of areas including lending. The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis.\u00a0Section 14 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012\u00a0provides for the appeal of certain decisions of the Central Bank, including\u00a0some lending restrictions,\u00a0to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. <\/p><p>  Where lending restrictions are imposed they tend to take the form of a restriction on individual loan size or on commercial lending activity and in some cases, a limit on the total lending permitted each month. At this time\u00a0fewer than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within the month, while close to 40% of all credit unions have a restriction on commercial lending activity. Currently, the average loan rate in the sector is just over &euro;6,000 and about a dozen individual credit unions\u00a0have lending restrictions that limit the amount loaned to less than &euro;10,000. This ensures that the vast majority of credit unions can continue to make loans significantly   greater than the average loan for the sector. <\/p><p>  Section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act\u00a01997 permits a credit union to have up to 30% of its\u00a0loan book outstanding for more than\u00a05 years and up to 10% of its loan book outstanding for more than 10 years.\u00a0Based on the most recent\u00a0information provided\u00a0by credit unions to the Central Bank in the December 2013 quarterly prudential returns,\u00a0average lending over 5 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0some 11%, while average lending over 10 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0about 2%. These figures\u00a0indicate that, in general, credit unions are currently well\u00a0within the limits as set down in the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>  The Section 35 requirements require that a credit union must not approve further agreements for additional credit where an existing loan has been rescheduled unless a member's ability to repay all credit owed and the proposed additional credit has been clearly established. Where such circumstances have been established, a credit union may grant additional credit to a member with a rescheduled loan where that rescheduled loan has performed in accordance with the new terms\u00a0 for an appropriate period, in most cases not less than one year.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank issued a\u00a0prudent lending circular for credit unions and expects credit unions to apply prudent lending standards to the granting of all new loans or top-ups of existing loans and to have systems in place to ensure that such applications are fully assessed to confirm the member's ability to repay the loan. This includes assessing a member's creditworthiness before concluding a credit agreement, which is required under Regulation 11 of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 for credit agreements between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000. \u00a0<\/p><p>  On foot of recommendations from the Commission on Credit Unions, section 11 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 substantially amends section 35 of the 1997 Act. These amendments provide for new Central Bank regulations to deal with a range of lending issues including:<\/p><p>  - the classes of lending that a credit union may engage in, for example business lending;<\/p><p>  - the duration of loans;<\/p><p>  - large exposures; and<\/p><p>  - concentration limits.<\/p><p>  Section 11 will be commenced in tandem with new Central Bank regulations on lending, which are to be introduced as part of the tiered regulatory approach recommended by the Commission. This tiered approach will address a range of areas including lending, investments, savings, borrowings, additional services, reserves and liquidity.  The Central Bank has recently held the first of its consultation processes on the tiered regulatory approach\u00a0and is considering the views submitted by credit unions and others.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the safety of members savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole\u00a0are central to any actions taken by the Registrar of Credit Unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700055#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Regulation","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700055#WRE01450"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[22305\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700055#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he favours the three tiered regulatory approach to credit unions as proposed by the Commission on Credit Unions or the two tiered approach currently being proposed by the Central Bank of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>The Commission on Credit Unions in its final Report recommended a tiered regulatory approach for credit unions.

In instances where a residential property is occupied by an individual who is permanently and totally incapacitated, the property may be exempt from LPT. These two LPT reliefs are outlined below. <\/p><p>Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value for LPT purposes of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided, or approved for grant aid, by a local authority and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property. The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed. Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot; <\/p><p>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals. In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted. <\/p><p>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B depends on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves. &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working. Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.\u00a0 The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.<\/p><p>Following representations and a review of the reliefs by Revenue, I announced on 2 May that I intend bringing forward legislation amending section 15A to remove the requirement that any adaptation work on the residential property must be grant-aided, or has been approved for grant-aid, by a local authority as one of the qualifying conditions for the tax relief. I also intend to remove the requirement, by way of legislation amending section 10B, that a permanent and totally incapacitated person must have benefitted from a Court or Injuries Board award or a public trust fund, to qualify for the exemption.<\/p><p>My officials wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advising her of my intention to amend the legislation with retrospective effect. In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.\u00a0 The Commissioners have recently published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue. The Guidelines are available on their website at: .  I am informed that Revenue will examine each application and may seek additional information if considered necessary before determining whether the person is entitled to a reduction in the market value of the property or to the exemption, whichever one is being claimed. <\/p><p>The Commissioners have also advised that no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the reduction in the market value under the LPT legislation and the liable person declared the reduced valuation when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return. Similarly, no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the exemption and the exemption was claimed when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return.\u00a0 The reliefs will continue to apply for all years up to 2016, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700055#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700056#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[22402\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700056#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when Ireland will apply for retrospective recapitalisation, through the European Stability Mechanism, of the moneys used to save Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>The Euro-area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 that \"it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns\", and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism could recapitalize banks directly. <\/p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting on 20 June 2013 agreed on the main features of the European Stability Mechanism's Direct Recapitalisation Instrument (DRI).

Cash interest payable in 2014 is currently estimated to be just under &euro;0.8 billion, the increase compared to 2013 largely reflecting the fact that a full year's interest is payable this year.

The 2010 Act created two statutory posts, a Head of Financial Regulation and a Head of Central Banking.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The current Head of Financial Regulation, or Deputy Governor (Financial Regulation), is Cyril Roux.\u00a0Mr Roux\u00a0was appointed as Deputy Governor (Financial Regulation) of the Central Bank of Ireland in October 2013.

He is one of three executive members of the Central Bank Commission and is a member of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). <\/p><p>  Prior to joining the Central Bank, he was First Deputy Secretary General of the French resolution and supervisory authority (ACPR) where he oversaw the prudential supervision of half of the credit institutions, including specialised mortgage lenders and foreign banks, the prudential supervision of most of the insurance and reinsurance sector, international affairs and accounting.\u00a0 Prior to joining the ACPR,\u00a0he was the Deputy Secretary General of the French insurance supervisory authority (ACAM).\u00a0 He also spent 10 years at AXA Insurance in a variety of posts. <\/p><p>  He\u00a0holds a PhD in Economics from Harvard University.\u00a0 He is a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique (France) and a member of the French Institute of Actuaries.\u00a0 He earned a bachelor's degree in Literature, summa cum laude, from the University of Paris - Sorbonne.<\/p><p>  Prior to Mr Roux, the position of Deputy Governor Financial Regulation was held by Matthew Elderfield. <\/p><p>  Prior to taking up his position at the Central Bank of Ireland,\u00a0Mr Elderfield\u00a0was Chief Executive of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) from 2007-2009, with responsibility for supervision of all financial services companies in Bermuda, including the third largest global reinsurance centre.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Prior to joining the BMA, he spent eight years at the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) as a Head of Department in a variety of posts, responsible for exchange and clearing house supervision, for secondary markets and listing policy and for banking supervision. <\/p><p>  Before joining the FSA,\u00a0he established the european operations of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and held posts at the London Investment Banking Association, the British Bankers Association and a Washington-DC based consultancy firm.<\/p><p>  In March 2011, he was appointed as an Adjunct Professor at University College Cork. <\/p><p>  He\u00a0graduated from Cambridge University in 1988 with a Masters degree in International Relations, and earned a Bachelors degree in Foreign Service, cum laude, from the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University in 1987.<\/p><p>  Prior to Mr Elderfield, the position of Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator was held by Patrick Neary. <\/p><p>  Mr Neary\u00a0was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator in February 2006. Prior to this, he held the position of Prudential Director of the Financial Regulator from 2003. In this role his responsibilities included the protection of consumers' deposits, funds and policies. <\/p><p>  He is a fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (FCCA).

The Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, as announced in March 2013, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have so far been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgages in difficulty where the mortgage is more than 90 days in arrears.  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has now concluded its audit and assessment of a sample of the banks' end 2013 target returns.  Based on the information submitted, the Central Bank has advised that the banks have indicated they have met the targets of proposing solutions to 50% and concluding solutions for 15% of those in arrears greater than 90 days.<\/p><p>  The consumer protection provisions of the Central Bank are contained within the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their PDH mortgage and it applies to all regulated mortgage lenders.  The CCMA is issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of this Code.  On the BTL mortgage aspect, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which falls within the remit of the Minister for Housing and Planning, provides the main regulatory framework for the private rental sector and prescribes the statutory rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank published the revised CCMA in June 2013.  As part of the financial institutions' delivery of full implementation of the revised CCMA, the boards of directors of all mortgage lenders were required by the Central Bank to sign off that all of the provisions of the revised CCMA had been fully implemented and tested and that staff training had been completed.  Compliance with the CCMA will continue to be central to the Central Bank's work programme throughout 2014 and an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA will be conducted later this year.<\/p><p>  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them, or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender.  Under the CCMA, borrowers have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.  If the borrower is not\u00a0satisified with the outcome of the appeal or complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p><p>  The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, in respect of the end of March, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December to around 62,000 in March 2014.

The\u00a0Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy of 2% is applied to home, motor and commercial insurance under the Insurance Act 1964 and came into effect from 1 January 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02050"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[23049\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kildare is due a refund on their tax liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no record of a refund claim from the person concerned.

This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission who report that the workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.<\/p><p>Resolutions offered to SME customers in difficulty are assessed on the basis of the borrowers maximum affordability.  The restructures are often complex due to multiple debt connections. \u00a0Irish banks\u00a0are advancing the process of restructuring their SME loan books.  I am informed by Bank of Ireland that the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 gives comprehensive additional asset quality disclosures on all of its Loan Portfolios from page 380 to 423, including details of forbearance measures on its SME loan portfolios from page 416.

It is important to highlight that the ECB Comprehensive Assessment will not get into loan restructuring.  The objective of the review is focused solely on determining whether the banks have enough provisions against their loans and capital. Irish banks have just undergone such an exercise, their second in less than three years, which led to a substantial increase in their loan loss provisions at year end.  As I have stated previously, I do not anticipate any capital issues for the Irish banks arising from the Comprehensive Assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stock Exchange Issues","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02650"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[23057\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700058#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Allied Irish Banks since its January 2011 listing on the Enterprise Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange has been subject to Market Abuse (Directive 2003\/6\/EC) Regulations 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>As the deputy is aware AIB is quoted\u00a0on the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM) of the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) since January 2011 and complies with its listing rules and requirements.

In general online purchasing is made by persons registered for VAT to individuals.  Online sales made by an Irish company to persons in Ireland are subject to Irish VAT in the normal manner.<\/p><p>  With regard to goods sold online from another EU Member State, EU VAT law provides specific rules for the supply of goods between EU Member States, to determine where the goods should be taxed.  In the case of goods supplied by a business in one EU Member State to a customer who is not registered for VAT in another Member State, generally the place where the goods are taxed is the place of the supplier.  Therefore, a UK business supplying to a consumer in Ireland would charge UK VAT on the purchase.<\/p><p>  However, where a business in one Member State supplies a large amount of goods to customers in another Member State, the rule of distance sales applies.  Distance selling for VAT purposes occurs where a supplier in one EU Member State sells goods to a person in another EU Member State, who is not registered for VAT, and the supplier is responsible for the delivery of the goods.  This includes mail order, phone and internet sales.  Under the distance selling arrangements, sales to customers in other Member States who are not registered for VAT are liable to VAT in the Member State of the supplier provided that the threshold appropriate to the Member State of the customer is not breached.  However, where total sales to a particular Member State exceed the threshold in any particular Member State, the supplier must register and account for VAT in that Member State.  The distance sales threshold in Ireland is &euro;35,000.  This means that where the value of distance sales to unregistered persons in Ireland by a supplier in another Member State exceeds or is likely to exceed &euro;35,000 in a calendar year, that supplier must register for VAT in Ireland and must account for VAT at the appropriate Irish rates.<\/p><p>  With regard to online sales made by businesses located outside the EU to customers in Ireland, such goods are subject to VAT and customs duties on importation.  However, the low value consignment relief provides that goods not exceeding a total value of &euro;22 may be imported without payment of VAT.  This is an administrative measure provided for under EU VAT law.  In addition, goods not exceeding &euro;150 may be imported without payment of customs duty, so that goods valued between &euro;22.01 and &euro;150 will qualify for relief from customs duty but VAT will still be chargeable.<\/p><p>  In relation to quantifying the amount of taxation forgone in the State as a result on online purchase of goods from outside the State by Irish residents, tax data is not collected in such a manner as would make such statistics available.  However, with regard to collecting taxes that are due in the State from online sales, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully aware of the potential for tax evasion as a result of eCommerce and online trading generally.  Revenue's overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are most appropriate for dealing with the specific risks presented in individual cases including those trading online.  Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system and the capture of data from multiple sources.  One of these sources is trading information received from merchant acquirers, which contains indicators of cases involved in internet trading.<\/p><p>  Revenue's extensive range of measures and activities, designed to address shadow economy activity, includes exploiting the potential of new and emerging technology towards the identification of tax evasion associated with online trading and business activity.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[19454\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will direct the National Asset Management Agency to publish its property portfolios in its entirety in order to make vacant properties visible and possibly available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>NAMA has acquired loans from the five participating institutions and is not the owner\/operator of properties.

The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  I understand from the Central Bank, that where the proceeds of an endowment policy are insufficient to repay the capital element of an endowment mortgage, borrowers should be given ample time to make alternative repayment arrangements.  Borrowers are afforded the protections of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears in cases where the mortgage is in arrears or in pre-arrears and is secured by the borrower's primary residence.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.  The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers.  These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis.  A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank s website www.centralbank.ie.  People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.

While the repossession of a principal dwelling house consequent upon mortgage default should only be considered as a last option for a person in genuine difficulty, repossessions do arise and this can be expected to continue as long as the mortgage crisis remains.  It should be noted, however, that when repossessions do arise, most are of a voluntary nature and\u00a0the legal repossession route only arises in a minority of cases.<\/p><p>  \u00a0The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a primary dwelling mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, as announced in March 2013, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have so far been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgages in difficulty where the mortgage is more than 90 days in arrears.  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has now concluded its audit and assessment of a sample of the banks' end 2013 target returns.  Based on the information submitted, the Central Bank has advised that the banks have indicated they have met the targets of proposing solutions to 50% and concluding solutions for 15% of those in arrears greater than 90 days.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that its MART publication of last March 2013 clearly indicates the where a lender relies on legal action to address an arrears situation it must be able to demonstrate that an alternative arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate.  Furthermore, if such a decision is made by the lender, the cooperating borrower has the right to appeal a decision not to offer an alternative repayment arrangement.<\/p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.  Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.  However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties.  The Deputy may wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department in respect of the end of March, some 62,000 principal dwelling mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013\u00a0provides\u00a0the power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.  In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not, insofar as is\u00a0reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.<\/p><p>  The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.  Even after the commencement of the legal process, it will be possible for lenders and borrowers to reengage and it will be in the best interests of the parties if that\u00a0happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":448,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[23244\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the National Asset Management Agency has been required to take any urgent, special steps to make suitable accommodation available to deal with the crisis of homelessness.","asker":"954","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>The Deputy\u00a0may be aware that NAMA has identified over 4,600 residential properties, controlled by its debtors and receivers, as being available and potentially suitable for social housing provision.

In general terms, no specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector.  Therefore, that part of the debt interest bill that relates to general borrowing used to recapitalise the banks can only be estimated.<\/p><p>  Capital injections into Irish banks from 2009 to 2011 can be separated\u00a0into three categories. (1) Capital injections that were made under Ministerial direction by the NPRF Commission amount to &euro;18.8 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland preference shares in 2013).  There is no interest cost associated with these payments as they did not require borrowing.  (2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010.  There was an interest holiday on the IBRC promissory note repayments in 2011 and 2012 and thus zero interest was payable for these years.  In 2013 promissory note interest\u00a0of &euro;214 million was payable up\u00a0to the date of IBRC's liquidation.  General government interest is also payable on the EBS promissory note for all years with an average of &euro;12 million payable between 2012 and 2014.  Under the terms of the promissory note an annual payment &euro;3.085 billion was to be made to the beneficiary banks.  This payment was made in cash in 2011, and the IBRC element\u00a0(&euro;3.06 billion) was\u00a0paid by way of a government bond in 2012.  Both these payments impacted the national debt and incurred general government interest costs of approximately &euro;0.3 billion in each of the years 2012 to 2014.  The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion.  The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin.  The margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues.  This gave rise to payments of &euro;0.65 billion in 2013 and an estimated &euro;0.8 billion in 2014.  The Deputy should note that these payments contribute significantly to the surplus income of the Central Bank, up to 80% of which is paid to the Central Fund in the following year.  (3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector.*  Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer, the impact can be estimated using the average rate of interest on government debt.  The average rate of interest on general government debt for 2013 is given as 4% in my Department's Stability Programme Update, 2014 published last month.  Using this interest rate to estimate the impact of injections into the banking sector from the Exchequer account gives estimated interest costs of &euro;0.45 billion\u00a0in 2012, &euro;0.5 billion in 2013 and &euro;0.4 billion in 2014.<\/p><p>  *This figure excludes fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700059#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[23247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700060#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total of the national debt; and the amount of the total debt accounted for by loans from the troika agencies.

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets.

This focus is further underpinned by the commitments contained in the \"Access to Finance\" chapter in Action Plan for Jobs 2014. I recently wrote to the banks with a view to ensuring\u00a0their continued commitment to work closely with my Department in faciliatating a positive business environment in which SMEs can prosper and contribute to economic growth, in addition to maintaining and increasing jobs in this vital sector.

Under the CCMA, if a borrower is not satisfied with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can\u00a0make a complaint to their lender. Borrowers also have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.\u00a0\u00a0 If the borrower is still unhappy with the outcome of the appeal or the complaint made to the lender, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. <\/p><p>  The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.\u00a0 The latest publication, in respect of the end of March, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.\u00a0 For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December to around 62,000 in March 2014.\u00a0 This data, as well as the Central Bank quarterly mortgage arrears publications, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.<\/p><p>  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.\u00a0\u00a0However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage\u00a0difficulty.\u00a0 Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.\u00a0 However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":507,"content":"<p>Question No. 185 answered with Question No. 178.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00450"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[23414\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the procedure applicable to banking and insurance corporations or similar entities exiting the Irish market with particular reference to the extent to which they might be expected to comply with their contractual obligations or duty of care; if any provision is made for losses accruing to their customers in this jurisdiction in the wake of their exit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, including banking and insurance. The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.<\/p><p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that according to Chapter 3.11 of the consumer protection code 2012:\u00a0\u00a0'where a regulated entity intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity it must:<\/p><p>  - notify the Central Bank immediately;<\/p><p>  - provide at least two months' notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;<\/p><p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer, merger or cessation of operations or, alternatively in the case of a transfer or merger, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer or merger; and<\/p><p>  - in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case'. <\/p><p>  If a firm does not provide a consumer with two months' notice of their intention to cease operating, this is a potential breach of Section 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code. The consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It should be noted that Consumer Protection Code 2012 is intended for\u00a0situations where regulated entities are in a position to provide such notice, i.e. in the cases of mergers and\u00a0transfers, and not in the case of insolvent liquidations. If there has been a breach of the Consumer Protection Code then the Central Bank is in a position to consider enforcement action.<\/p><p>  Under the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code, banks are required to give a minimum of 2 months' notice before they close a consumer's account. It is\u00a0important that consumers are given adequate notice to allow them to take the required steps to close or transfer their accounts. All banks providing current accounts in Ireland are subject to the Central Bank's Current Account Switching Code, which is designed to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker and to offer protection and support for consumers when switching bank account.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Two banks have in recent times announced their intention to withdraw from the Irish market.

This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.\u00a0Setanta\u00a0was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA following a meeting of the creditors which took place on the 30 April, 2014 where a liquidator, Mr Paul Mercieca, was appointed.\u00a0The Liquidator has written to all policyholders in the last week informing them that their policies would be cancelled, in accordance with the terms of the policy of insurance with the Company.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has been engaging with the liquidator and with brokers who sold the policies to ensure\u00a0all policyholders that hold a current Setanta motor insurance policy urgently make alternative motor insurance arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0 The Central Bank as well as the Department of Finance have also liaised with the relevant industry representative bodies.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00650"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[22385\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700061#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 95 of 7 May 2014, if he will consider introducing an exemption from maths for children with the rare diagnosis of dyscalculia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>The approach to teaching and learning in schools is that teachers use differentiation to address different rates of learning to reflect  the educational needs and in particular the learning skills and abilities of their pupils. <\/p><p>  My Department supports the holistic development of the young person and, other than in the case of Irish (which is under review), exempting pupils from a key subject area, such as mathematics, is not recommended in view of the need to support the student's overall development.

The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs, including deaf and hard of hearing children, should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs.  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resources to schools for children who are deaf and hard of hearing.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p><p>  Depending on the needs of the child, deaf and hard of hearing pupils may receive additional teaching support in schools, either from a school's general allocation of Learning Support\/Resource Teaching, or from an allocation of additional Resource Teacher hours to the schools from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools.  Many deaf and hard of hearing children have access to such SNA support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.  The Circular explains that schools should ensure that SNAs who work with Deaf and hard of hearing children are equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of these pupils, including capacity to use Sign Language where required. <\/p><p>  Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats, such as radio aids or sound field systems for deaf and hard of hearing pupils.  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  In addition, the Visiting Teacher service provides a service to deaf and hard of hearing children from pre-school to third level, while the Special Education Support Service (SESS) expanded its team with specialist expertise in deaf education in January 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700062#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Data","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700062#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[22323\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700062#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of special needs assistants in primary and secondary schools in County Clare; the number of children to whom they provided support in 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.

These presentations formed part of the NCSE formal consultation process on the development of its policy advice on the education of children with autism\/autism spectrum disorder.<\/p><p>  Professor Julian Leslie was regrettably unable to attend on the day as he was out of the country.  As none of his colleagues from the Division of Behaviour Analysis, PSI were available on that date, he indicated that he was  happy for Dr Martin and Professor Keenan to put the case.   Professor Leslie sent a note which he asked to be circulated to members for the meeting.  Professors  Keenan and  Martin made the presentation on the day and Professor Leslie's note was circulated, as he requested.<\/p><p>  The NCSE has also advised that it is their intention to formally invite the Psychological Society of Ireland to a meeting to hear any views it may wish to put forward.  I am of the view that the approach being adopted by the NCSE in ensuring that it has heard the view of all stakeholders is the correct approach and that this will ensure that all views will receive a fair and balanced consideration.  I look forward to receiving their report which I expect in the Spring of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN01550"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[22414\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 186 and 216 of 30 April 2014, if he was aware when he made his reply of the recent ESRI-NCSE report which raised concerns over the extent to which teachers have the appropriate skills and qualifications to meet the needs of children with ASD and if he will share the documents he received from the Teaching Council that address the concerns raised by the ESRI-NCSE report with regard to the skills and qualifications.

Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.  In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.  Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child.  The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail oco@oco.ie.<\/p><p>Section 28 of the Education Act 1998 provides for grievance and appeal procedures in schools. It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school concerned.  Section 29 of the Act sets out a limited set of circumstances a parent can appeal administrative decisions of a school.  These are confined to expulsions, suspensions or refusal to enroll.  The Government has approved the drafting of the Admissions to School Bill 2014 in which the extent to which refusal to enroll will or will not be subject to a Section 29 appeal will be addressed.<\/p><p>  I am not satisfied with the current provisions of Section 28. I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter.  Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a Charter.  Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Amalgamation","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN02450"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[22436\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700063#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regard to progress concerning the merger of two schools (details provided) in County Kilkenny; when he expects this amalgamation to be completed; when he believes that a new amalgamated school building will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>I can confirm for the Deputy that my Department has approved the amalgamation of the schools to which he refers with effect from September 2014.

The level of facilities, including playspace, that can be provided in schools will therefore vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school.  A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website (<i>www.education.ie<\/i>) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works.<\/p><p>My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.

The Circular provides details of the primary care needs for which SNA support will usually be provided and details the types of secondary care associated tasks which SNAs may often perform.  It clarifies the role of the Classroom Teacher and Resource-Learning Support Teachers to provide for the education of a child, and the role of an SNA to support those teachers in assisting with care needs.  The role that professional reports play in supporting the SNA scheme is also set out. While professional reports play a valuable role in identifying the needs of a child, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports to be provided to schools rests with the NCSE, in accordance with DES policy.<\/p><p>In June 2011, the DES published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools. Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>Whereas all SNA allocations are reviewed annually, it should not be assumed that any such review may lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs. The Circular acknowledges that many pupils will have care needs which may remain constant. However, the Circular makes clear that whereas supports may be reduced to ensure that pupils who have diminishing care needs can be afforded an opportunity to develop independent living skills, that SNA supports will continue to be provided for those pupils who have ongoing care needs.<\/p><p>My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.

These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time. The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.<\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  Accordingly, DES Circular 71\/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.<\/p><p>  Link to DES Circular 71\/2011 is as follows: <i><\/i>.

The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<blockquote>SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.<br \/><br \/>These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers. This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.<\/blockquote>An LRC process has now commenced in respect of the application of this provision of the Haddington Road Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03050"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[22871\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department is setting up wage curtailment with circular letter 0041\/2014 (details supplied).","asker":"1192","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":738,"content":"<p>DES Circular 0041\/2014 (see link as follows) was introduced solely with the intention of providing a job-sharing scheme for Special Needs Assistants and not setting up wage curtailment. <i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training Provision","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03250"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[22873\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding training allowances (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[23272\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700065#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the restitution of the additional training allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 298 together.<\/p><p>  The payment of an additional training allowance of &euro;31.80 per week for the long term unemployed was introduced during a period of high employment levels as an incentive for the long term unemployed to participate in F&Aacute;S (now SOLAS) training courses.

Teachers have also had opportunities to engage with additional CPD in the form of modular courses on areas of particular interest, for example, the use of ICT in maths teaching, as well as a national conference.<\/p><p>  In addition, Project Maths is also supported by the Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching, a blended learning, two year part-time programme. The programme assists 'out-of-field' teachers to acquire the extensive and complex integrated knowledge base including mathematical and pedagogical knowledge that is necessary for effective mathematics teaching at post-primary level with special reference to Project Maths. Since September 2012 it has been made available nationwide free of charge to improve the skills of certain maths teachers at post-primary level.<\/p><p>  Provision of the course is led by the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching &amp;amp; Learning (NCE-MSTL), based in the University of Limerick (UL), and it will be accredited jointly by the UL and NUI Galway through their strategic alliance.<\/p><p>  Some 600 teachers have participated in the programme so far and a further intake is planned for 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700066#WRQ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700066#WRQ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[23012\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700066#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of junior certificate and leaving certificate pupils who applied during each of the past seven years for a reader, a waiver from the assessment of spelling, grammar and punctuation in the language subjects, use of a tape recorder or word processor, a scribe, reasonable accommodation on the grounds of visual impairment, reasonable accommodation on the grounds of hearing difficulties, reasonable accommodation on the grounds of physical disability, a helper for practical subjects, an exemption from the practical test in home economics, an exemption from the project in home economics; the number of these applications that were granted during each of these years; the number of negative decisions that were appealed during each of these years; and the number of negative decisions that were successful on appeal.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations in the Certificate examinations.

The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible.  Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time.  However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis.  Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).<\/p><p>It was originally envisaged that the first revaluation of all commercial properties on a nationwide basis would be completed by 2018.  However, while commendable progress has been made, the achievement of this target will require an acceleration of the programme and enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012.\u00a0  This Bill\u00a0had its Second Stage reading in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11<sup>th<\/sup>October, 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage.  It\u00a0provides for a number of initiatives to advance the roll out of the revaluation \u00a0programme, such as the piloting of an &quot;occupier assisted valuation&quot; option which will be available to allow ratepayers in appropriate circumstances to assist in the revaluation of their local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas.  There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme which is also\u00a0being initiated as a pilot project.  The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.<\/p><p>Steady progress is being made on the National Revaluation Programme.  Between 2007 and 2010 the three Rating Authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were revalued comprising c.17,700 commercial properties which represents approximately 22% of the national rateable valuation base.  Additionally, there are currently six revaluation projects in progress which include the Rating Authority areas of Dublin City, Waterford City and County and Dungarvan Town together with Limerick City and County comprising c. 38,000 commercial properties or 32.6% of the valuation base.  The Dublin City and Waterford projects are now largely complete, except for the appeal phase which is currently underway, while the first phase of the Limerick revaluation will be completed in June, 2014 with the issue of approximately 6,700 proposed valuation certificates to ratepayers in the newly merged City and County council area. <\/p><p>The approximate change in rates liability for commercial ratepayers that has resulted from revaluation in the rating authorities which have been completed to date or are now near completion indicates that generally in or around 55% have a reduced liability, while in or around 45% would have an increased liability.<\/p><p>Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions.  Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the rating authority concerned.\u00a0<\/p><p>The statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made, \u00a0is under way with a further three rating authorities - Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council and Carlow County Council.  Decisions in relation to a further set of rating authorities for revaluation are currently under consideration by the Valuation Office.<\/p><p>The number of staff which it is proposed to commit to future revaluation projects cannot be precise at this stage due to a number of variable factors which are expected to impact on the available resources.  The staff projections will depend on the numbers required for other statutory and other work such as the ongoing revision of valuation programme and the requirement for staff to handle appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation.  Currently, the valuer complement is 69, the majority of whom will be employed on future revaluation projects.  As was the case with previous projects, the staff will be organised in discrete project teams, the membership of which may vary in number from approximately six to twelve according to the projected workload and complexity of each project. <\/p><p>The current position as regards projects in train or pending is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Rating Authority Area<\/th><th>Date Valuation Order Signed<\/th><th>Publication Date for the New Valuation List <\/th><th>Numberof Items<\/th><th>% of Valuation Base [Pre - Revaluation]<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>5\/05\/2011<\/td><td>31\/12\/2013 *<\/td><td>20845<\/td><td>26.62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City<\/td><td>12\/12\/2011<\/td><td>31\/12\/2013 *<\/td><td>2129<\/td><td>1.44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County<\/td><td>12\/12\/2011<\/td><td>31\/12\/2013 *<\/td><td>1231<\/td><td>0.39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dungarvan Town <\/td><td>12\/12\/2011<\/td><td>31\/12\/2013 *<\/td><td>572<\/td><td>0.24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City<\/td><td>29\/03\/2012<\/td><td>31\/12\/2014<\/td><td>3100<\/td><td>1.94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County <\/td><td>29\/03\/2012<\/td><td>31\/12\/2014<\/td><td>3700<\/td><td>1.98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City<\/td><td>Valuation Order pending<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3702<\/td><td>2.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County<\/td><td>Valuation Order pending<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2967<\/td><td>1.40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County<\/td><td>Valuation Order pending<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1888<\/td><td>0.78<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>40134<\/td><td>37.09<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* Appeal decisions pending<\/p><p>2009 baseline data<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700068#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700068#WRS02550"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[22610\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700068#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider a temporary barrier at a location (details supplied) in County Galway, to deal with the threat of flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":877,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works has no responsibility for the maintenance of any channel at these locations.

This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale\u00a0'Meet the\u00a0Buyer' events hosted nationwide.  These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade-Ireland.  To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.<\/p><p>  My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10\/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.  These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts.  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.  The SME Working Group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from ISME, IBEC, Inter Trade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.\u00a0The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.<\/p><p>  In 2011, 10.55% (valued at &euro;240 million) of the total known awarded contracts above EU threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies.  This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion.  It is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad.  The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion.  The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.<\/p><p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":921,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02350"},{"type":"question","counter":922,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[23221\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason for the delay in his signing of the commencement order for the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":923,"content":"<p>The Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act was signed into law on 12<sup>th<\/sup>April 2014.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides that commencement of the Act would be subject to Ministerial Order, or Orders, as necessary.<\/p><p>The relevant Order, and another Order under the Act,\u00a0were prepared in the normal way in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and were signed by the Minister immediately on presentation to him on May 15<sup>th<\/sup>last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader's Allowance Issues","counter":924,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02550"},{"type":"question","counter":925,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[23403\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount paid to each qualifying party leader in respect of TDs, not including payments made in respect of Senators; the amount paid to each independent TD under section 10 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, on each year of the 28th and 29th D&aacute;ileanna; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":926,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply on 15 April 2014\u00a0to her previous question on this matter (number 284 - ref. 17940\/14).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":927,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02750"},{"type":"question","counter":928,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[22397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700069#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding the discussion between the EU and the US on a trade agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":929,"content":"<p>Since the EU Council&rsquo;s Decision in last June, to start negotiations with the US on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Agreement, five negotiating rounds have taken place, the most recent one last week in the US.  This Round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials.  Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition.<\/p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:<\/p><p>The first is <b>market access<\/b>, for goods, services, and public procurement.  The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect.  On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S.  The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon.  Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our services exporters and for those looking to penetrate the very large U.S. public procurement market.<\/p><p>The second area covered by the talks is <b>&ldquo;rules&rdquo;<\/b>, on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil\/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of standards\/protections).  Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply many standards and market regulations, and regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.<\/p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is <b>reducing regulatory burdens, <\/b>which will involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In particular, areas of regulation such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety are important here, where there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to the retention of high standards that serve to protect consumers.  The objective is to address differences in standards between our two economies while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.<\/p><p>Progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important area, as the result of studies show it will yield the most net gains.  The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from a future agreement would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators.  It is important to see this as a two part issue:  the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated.  How regulations are made, needs to be more transparent, with regulators deepening relationships in order to address emerging issues together such as setting standards for new technologies.  Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them.<\/p><p>In addition, real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers.  Bringing about more regulatory convergence will help exporters and investors by reducing the cost of doing business across the Atlantic.  It will make it easier for companies to comply with both US and EU laws at the same time at lower cost.  This is important for SMEs that often don&rsquo;t have the scale and resources to meet regulatory requirements on both sides of the Atlantic for the same products.  Indeed, extending the scope for mutual recognition across many professional bodies, for example, would make it easier for professionals to source new job opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p><p>It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened.<\/p><p>As regards investment protection, the public consultation launched by the European Commission last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is still underway and will run until 6 July.  All stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission, and can be used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation can be accessed at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website:<\/p><p><i>]<\/i>.<\/p><p>Last week, as in all previous negotiating rounds, both negotiating teams maintained close dialogue with a large number of representatives of the academic community, consumer groups, labour unions, environmental groups, farmers and employers.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014.  Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas. <\/p><p>  Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process. <\/p><p>  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties.  Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve the current difficulties, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. <\/p><p>  The Community Welfare Services, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports. <\/p><p>  In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in finalising a further interagency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy to ensure that the necessary supports can be put in place.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance. <\/p><p>  Department officials have discretionary powers to award a supplement where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant and is of an exceptional nature. The Department does not maintain statistics on the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the use of discretion under Article 38.  <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to a further six selected local authorities during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700070#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":991,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700071#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":992,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[22133\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700071#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the circumstances under which it is considered acceptable and legal to temporarily withdraw jobseeker's benefit or allowance from a person; the number of cases in the past year in which this has occurred; if this practice is compatible with her obligation to ensure that no person falls below a certain guaranteed minimum income deemed necessary to maintain a minimum basic standard of living; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":993,"content":"<p>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).  <\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings. Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels. This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes. As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p><p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.   Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.   This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.   Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. <\/p><p>  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p><p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.<\/p><p>  Matters in relation to assisting persons in establishing businesses would be for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance. However, I am aware that a range of supports exist to support such enterprise including the back to work enterprise allowance and the short term enterprise allowance offered by this Department and the start your own business scheme of tax relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700072#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700072#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[22274\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700072#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on a carer's allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford who is still waiting to receive correspondence on their application.","asker":"1062","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer's allowance from the person in question on 30 April 2014.

Nos. 391 and 393 together.<\/p><p>  T&uacute;s and Gateway are part of a suite of initiatives being offered by the Department which are designed to bridge the gap between unemployment and re-entering

The provision for T&uacute;s in 2014 is &euro;119.6 million with an additional &euro;19.1 million being provided for Gateway.  An additional &euro;2 million has been provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (D\/CELG) to support Gateway.  The level of placements allocated to T&uacute;s and Gateway is 7,500 and 3,000 respectively.  T&uacute;s is maintaining participation at around 7,500 participants subject to natural throughput due to jobseekers leaving and others being recruited to the scheme.  The 3,000 placements on Gateway are to be filled by the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  The average annual gross cost to the Department of a participant on T&uacute;s is estimated at &euro;15,730.

The annual costs of Gateway are estimated at &euro;14,404 per participant made up of pay costs of &euro;13,469 and related costs of &euro;935.  The higher pay costs on Gateway result from the higher value in the underlying value of jobseeker payments for those recruited to the scheme of &euro;257 per week against &euro;240 for T&uacute;s.  These costs are expected to align over time as the level of recruitment expands.  <\/p><p>  With regard to supervision on Gateway, the D\/CELG recently sanctioned 150 acting-up allowances for existing staff to support the scheme, at an additional cost of &euro;125,000.

Training expenses for JobBridge interns are incurred by the host organisation not the Department.<\/p><p>There are no circumstances in which a JobBridge intern will be permitted to undertake a second internship with the same host organisation.  This provision, and the provision that the intern may not undertake an internship with a host organisation with which they have had a previous employment relationship, ensure that the intern gains a wide spectrum of experience and new skills from their participation in JobBridge.  Host organisations are precluded from filling the same position with an intern for six months after the end of the internship unless the intern moves directly into employment, either with the host organisation or another company.  This is to prevent displacement of employees, excessive use of interns, and as an incentive to employ, or improve the employability of, the intern.<\/p><p>JobBridge is targeted at those on the Live Register who can benefit from real workplace experience to increase their employability and move into employment.  It is not a general internship scheme.  It is not intended for those in employment hoping to work in a particular sector.<\/p><p>The scheme has been launched in this targeted way to allocate scarce exchequer resources to make maximum impact for those at risk of long term unemployment while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market. The Department does not make exceptions to the qualifying criteria. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1119,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Yield","counter":1120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1121,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[22473\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"at the time of the budget day estimates published last October what was the projected PRSI income for 2014; and what has the PRSI income been in the year to date and the way this compare with the projection.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1122,"content":"<p>The Budget Day estimate for the Department of Social Protection was published last October and provides for income of &euro;7,682 million to the Social Insurance Fund in 2014.<\/p><p>The yield from PRSI to the end of April 2014 was &euro;2,597 million or &euro;107 million ahead of profile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1123,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[22477\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700073#WRX02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an ESB reconnection in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1126,"content":"<p><b><\/b>The person concerned is in receipt of one parent family payment from this Department and has earnings from employment.

The statistics show that there is no policy of a blanket refusal of initial applications.<\/p><p>Eligibility for DCA is not based on the disability but on the level of additional care required by the child because of that disability.  Autistic Spectrum Disorder is treated in the same manner as any other disability or condition under the scheme.  The Department undertook an assessment of applications that had been processed over a two year period, which indicated that while an overall average of 49% of applications were approved by a deciding officer at assessment stage some 55% of applications in respect of children on the Autistic spectrum were awarded. This statistic would indicate that children with Autism are not treated in a manner that would disadvantage their application for the payment.<\/p><p>It should be noted also that the administrative recommendations made in the report of the review of the DCA scheme relating to changes to the application, decision and appeal processes have been implemented from the 7th April 2014.  The application form has been redesigned to allow the detail of the child&rsquo;s care needs to be more comprehensively documented by the parent\/guardian. Also, an additional medical information form can be completed for children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders, such as Autism. This additional medical information, which will be supplied by the specialist attending the child, will ensure that the appropriate information is available to assist in the decision making process. It is hoped that having as much information as possible on the child&rsquo;s care needs available at the initial assessment stage will allow the correct decision to be made at the earliest opportunity possible and reduce the need for further examination and for recourse to the appeals process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700075#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1188,"content":"<p>Question No. 420 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700075#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1190,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[22749\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700075#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a reply to an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) will issue.","asker":"968","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1191,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 5<sup>th<\/sup>December 2013.

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS. <\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to people on the live register by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with people who are unemployed and in particular those who are, or become, long term unemployed. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.    It is in this context that the Department took a decision to rebalance resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location. <\/p><p>  In the instance where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service. All affected customers have been written to advising them of the dedicated email addresses and phone lines that have been set up allowing in many cases, for customer queries to be processed without having to attend a clinic. In addition, customers have also been advised of the new postal addresses of the Intreo offices and the clinic opening hours. In the event that a face to face meeting is still necessary, but the customer is unable to travel to the public clinic, for example due to illness, an officer will arrange a visit to the customer&rsquo;s home. <\/p><p>  The Department is continuously reviewing the staffing needs for all areas of its business, to ensure that the best possible use is made of available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700076#WRAA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700076#WRAA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1248,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[22918\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700076#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 111 of 3 April 2014, if he will assure the question asked in relation to the scope afforded to trustees to recognise differences within the pensioner group or deferred group in relation to the new guidance issued by the pensions authority, in relation to applying cuts rather than representation rights, that is that a scale of protection to recognise length of service, age, duration and varying contributions made, is included to protect members with long pensionable service and contributions.","asker":"1192","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1249,"content":"<p>The provisions in the Pensions Act do take the length of service accrued in a pension scheme into account when calculating pension entitlement.

These will be looked at in more detail in the coming months as site specific management plans are being drafted.  <\/p><p>  Following a request by the Tullagher Lough and Bog Special Area of Conservation Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, a scientific review of that site has been recently undertaken by my Department as part of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. The results of this review have determined that turf cutting may be consented to in certain parts of the special area of conservation but will not be permitted in other parts. Tullagher Lough and Bog is quite exceptional as a raised bog special area of conservation and the particular hydrological context allows for limited turf extraction, while not compromising the conservation of the threatened habitats on the site. In the case of Tullagher Lough and Bog, I have issued consent to cut turf, from 2014, to 117 individuals who had applied to my Department for compensation in relation to the cessation of turf cutting but who may now continue to cut turf on the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Development","counter":1344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1345,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[22895\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the date on which he sent a letter to the German Embassy seeking to advance a bilateral agreement on film co-production; if or when he received a response from the German Ambassador; the German position on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1346,"content":"<p>I wrote the letter referred to by the Deputy on 19th February 2014 and my Department has recently been in further contact with the embassy on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turbary Rights","counter":1347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1348,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[22946\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in respect of a bog (details supplied) if a person can resume cutting there; what are the stipulations and conditions, for a person, to utilise the said bog; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1349,"content":"<p>The <i>Review of Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs),<\/i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <b><i><font color=\"#008080\"><\/font><\/i><\/b>, provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on raised bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700078#WRCC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":1351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD00100"},{"type":"question","counter":1352,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[22988\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if any State funding is available for the replacement of the roof of a church (details supplied) whose main building is 150 years old and whose bell tower is 200 years old in view of the importance of the building to Ireland's built heritage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1353,"content":"<p>Grant funding for the protection of built heritage is provided by my Department via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and agencies.

In Ireland, scientific studies also show that recruitment has been declining since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 level.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.<\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.<\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 79 areas in County Tipperary, including the area of Newtown and 20 areas in County Laois, including Errill Village are to be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 43 fibre-based broadband networks in County Tipperary, including Roscrea, and 21 such networks in County Laois by July 2016.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":1373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1374,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[22124\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to ensure the future prosperity and sustainability of the post office network; if he will confirm that there are no plans to close Erne Street Upper Post Office in Dublin 2; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1375,"content":"<p>Insofar as plans for the development of the post office network are concerned, I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 111 [19991\/14] of 6 May 2014.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.<\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>The State has previously intervened in the telecoms sector through the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme, by constructing three MANs networks in Co Limerick, in Abbefeale, Newcastlewest and Limerick city. These networks are all currently in use by telecoms operators, who are making telecoms services available to businesses and citizens in Limerick.<\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 48 areas in County Limerick will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 44 fibre-based broadband networks in County Limerick, including the area of Newcastle West by July 2016.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cable Licensing","counter":1392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1393,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[22753\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700079#WRDD04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if commercial cable companies need a licence to place cables on private property, including private residential properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1394,"content":"<p>Operators of cable television networks are required to register as an Authorised Undertaking with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), in advance of offering services to the public and to comply with the ex-ante operational requirements imposed on authorised undertakings by ComReg, when operating the network to provide services to the public.

This NEEAP contains a status report on current actions as well as actions planned for the next three years.<\/p><p>A number of supports are in place for schools.  In partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills has developed an &quot;Energy in Education&quot; website which was launched in October 2012.

Since commencement, across the participating schools, the total energy spend is &euro;6m with an average achievable energy savings identified of 10%, amounting to approximately &euro;600,000.  The inclusion of the Energy in Education Initiative is considered to be a very effective policy tool for improving the energy performance of schools as well as helping to meet our 2020 targets.<\/p><p>My Department has developed the National Energy Services Framework to help develop the energy-efficiency market in the non-domestic sector throughout Ireland.  This Framework sets out a roadmap for energy efficiency projects and specifically how an Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process is undertaken in the public and private sector. The first tranche of exemplar energy efficiency projects was launched in June 2013 which will collectively see investment of up to &euro;55m in energy saving measures and result in annual savings of &euro;7m. There are currently 21 projects (11 public and 10 private sector) underway, including one from the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (ETB). This project will result in the retrofit of 17 schools utilising an EPC for which the procurement process is underway.<\/p><p>The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy efficiency (including water conservation and efficiency) in school buildings and this has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in design and specification.

Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 105 areas in County Mayo will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 39 fibre-based broadband networks in County Mayo, including the areas of Ballycastle and Glenamoy by July 2016.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1410,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Functions","counter":1409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1410,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[22167\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland regarding the Local Government Reform Act 2014 and in particular to that part of the Act abolishing town and borough councils which the AMAI was statutorily obliged to represent, relied heavily on legal opinion of one person (details supplied); if he will as guardian for public expenditure and reform confirm that the above mentioned senior counsel is the one and the same councillor of the Labour party sitting on Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; if he will confirm that the AMAI a statutory body receiving public funds sought the required three quotations for this legal advice; the other persons who tendered for the advice project; the selection\/elimination processes that were used to award the project to the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1411,"content":"<p>I have no function s in relation to procurement of legal advice by the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":1412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1413,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[22168\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700080#WREE01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the person who was President of The Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in October 2012 when the document Putting People First was published; if he will document all of the correspondences, discussions, minutes of meetings and so on that took place between his Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the AMAI since October 2012 to date, relating to the Local Government Bill 2013 Local Government Act 2014 and the document Putting People First with the abolition of Borough and Town Councils, if he will confirm that conforming with its own Constitution that the AMAI , also abolished, must and has or will be repatriating all of its assets to the respective abolished local authorities; if he will confirm what the current assets of AMAI; if the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the wind up of AMAI; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1414,"content":"<p>My Department had ongoing engagement, both formal and informal, with the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland (AMAI) relating to the implementation of the <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government<\/i>and the drafting of the Local Government Reform Bill 2013 .

The set-back distance requirements are 200m from an abstraction point for a water scheme supplying 100m<sup>3<\/sup>or more of water per day or serving 500 or more persons; 100m for an abstraction point for water used for human consumption in a water scheme supplying 10m<sup>3<\/sup>or more of water per day or serving 50 or more persons; and 25m from any borehole, spring or well used for the abstraction of water for human consumption. <\/p><p>These setback distances can be reduced to 30m (and 15m in the case of small abstractions) where the local authority determines that the reduced distance does not give rise to a risk to the water supply and a potential danger to human health.

A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website, <\/p><p>.  This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan will be reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.   <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and related services rests with housing authorities. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. <\/p><p>My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to lead housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1998. Housing authorities provide additional funding from their own resources. The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need. <\/p><p>A recent survey of lead housing authorities confirmed that 142 unique individuals were in Section 10-funded emergency accommodation in the South East Region during the week of 7 to 13 April 2014.

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <\/p><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations. <\/p><p>In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in these Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in the discharge of its functions.      <\/p><p>The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering. There are no plans to provide addition allowances, other than those recently announced by the Government.   <\/p><p>The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the Minister for Health and the Health Services Executive.  There are no plans at present to provide communal public taps in community locations.   <\/p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to the  Government&rsquo;s recent decisions relating to domestic water charges, including to ensure the water charges plan makes provision for circumstances where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted (e.g. customers with boil water notices). As required by the Act, a draft of the policy direction has issued to the CER and the Joint Oireachtas Committee for the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and has been published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il. The draft direction is currently open for public consultation and details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <\/p><p>.   <\/p><p>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and the policy direction issued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Staff","counter":1462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1463,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[22149\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of employees previously employed in the water services section of local authorities; if these employees are now classed as employees of Irish Water; if he will outline the implications of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1464,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to be formed and registered under the Companies Act. <\/p><p>  A fundamental underpinning of the water reform programme is to ensure that the skills and experience built up over many years in local authorities are put to best use for the long-term benefit of the customer and that there is no negative impact on service to customers during the transition.

The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in t his context are matters for each individual local authority.

Part 1 of that standard provides accurate and reliable protocols to determine whether or not a dwelling is or may be affected by reactive pyrite in the sub-floor hardcore material and gives clear guidance on the process and procedures to be followed in order to determine if a dwelling should be remediated or monitored.   <\/p><p>The pyrite remediation scheme, which was published by the Pyrite Resolution Board in February of 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel.  The scheme is one of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and only applies to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1.  In addition, applicants must be able to demonstrate to the Pyrite Resolution Board that they have no practicable options other than under the scheme to secure the remediation of their dwellings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Staff","counter":1483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1484,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[22345\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff that work in the leak detection unit of Irish Water; the number of those that are presently employed on temporary contracts; if the local authorities have applied to have the recruitment embargo lifted in order that these staff may be retained in the future, or if these staff will be seconded to Irish Water for the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1485,"content":"<p>Staffing arrangements within Irish Water is an operational matter for the company and one in which I have no function.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the domestic meter installation programme.   <\/p><p>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that each water meter has a low power radio unit fixed to the top which enables it to be read periodically from a passing van. This is what is known as Automatic Meter Reading (AMR). The AMR is dormant until the meter is read when it is activated only for the purpose of taking the meter read.  The meters used by Irish Water do not currently employ smart metering technology. However, the meters are capable of being integrated into a smart meter reading system, should that ever be required. Irish Water has procured meters and radio units that comply with all relevant European and international standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the public.     <\/p><p>Local authorities are in the final stages of a pre-installation survey of households connected to such supplies. The survey is providing information to Irish Water on the properties that can be metered. The intention is that a meter will be installed in any property connected to a public water supply where it is technically feasible to do so.  The matter of occupancy of the property will be addressed separately.  In advance of the commencement of charges, Irish Water will be engaging with every household to verify customer details.   <\/p><p>In designing the technical specification for the Metering Capital Programme, Irish Water has drawn both from international standards and from extensive local experience of the installation of both Grade B and Grade C meter box covers over the last 12 years. Irish Water monitors the installations by its contractors and can require the installation of a Grade B meter box if it is deemed necessary. Irish Water regularly undertakes technical reviews of the metering programme with the aim of making improvements. <\/p><p>Irish Water has recently commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered. In particular, the Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase of metering of some 48,000 apartments, which the report suggests can be easily metered as part of a separate procurement process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1492,"content":"<p>Question No. 526 answered with Question No. 515.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[22367\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of dog licences that were issued in 2013.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1495,"content":"<p>Statistics in relation to a range of dog control responsibilities of local authorities, including dog licence numbers, are published annually by my Department and are available for 2013 at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1496,"content":"<p>Question No. 528 answered with Question No. 515.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Losses","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[22450\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700081#WRFF03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the discussions his Department has had with IMPACT and SIPTU in relation to the possible job losses that could occur due to the proposed changes in the delivery of the social inclusion and LEADER programme; if he intends personally meeting the two unions to discuss this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>My Department, along with other Government Departments, Agencies and other statutory and non-statutory funders, has contracts with local development companies and other organisations in respect of various programmes and schemes. <\/p><p>  Outside of contracting for such programmes, my Department has no role in the internal operations of local development companies and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage. <\/p><p>  In many cases it is likely that the programmes and schemes which my Department has contracted with local development companies would represent a minority of the companies&rsquo; income. <\/p><p>Accordingly, and consistent with the position my Department has always held, I cannot become party to an engagement on matters affecting staff of local development companies.   <\/p><p>However, given the agreement facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, my Department will meet the parties on a once-off basis to brief the parties on certain policies being advanced by my Department at this point.

Against this background, I am acutely conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. <\/p><p>  The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index and from the Daft.ie Rental Report show the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities. In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.4% annually, and for apartments the figure was 8%. <\/p><p>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. In 2006, some 93,419 housing units were completed across the country, 19,470 of them in Dublin. In 2013, a total of 8,301 homes were completed nationally with just 1,360 in Dublin. The volume of activity in residential building and construction remains less than half of the volume seen in the year 2000.   <\/p><p>  Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government&rsquo;s Construction Strategy, published on 14 May 2014, is a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector. It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.   <\/p><p>  Over half a billion euro in funding is being made available through my Department across a range of housing programmes in 2014 and I expect that in the region of 5,000 social housing units will be provided this year. <\/p><p>  Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time.  Consequently, I have asked the PRTB to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations before the end of June.  My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700082#WRGG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1527,"content":"<p>Question No. 540 answered with Question No. 508.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations Amendments","counter":1528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700082#WRGG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1529,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[22567\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700082#WRGG02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will clarify the existing statutory position relating the self-building of their own homes by those who wish to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1530,"content":"<p>The Building Control Act 1990 places a clear statutory obligation on owners, designers and builders to ensure that buildings are designed and constructed in compliance with the building regulations. This applies to all sectors of the construction industry, including the self-build sector. <\/p><p>Neither the Building Control Act nor any regulations thereunder, including the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, place any restrictions on whom an owner may assign as a builder once the owner is satisfied that the builder is competent to undertake the works involved.   <\/p><p>An owner who intends to self-build, and who contracts out elements of their work to other parties, must assume legal responsibility for ensuring that the building or works concerned will comply with the requirements of building regulations.   <\/p><p>The reply given to Question Nos. 432 and 434 of 4 February 2014 addresses some of the practical consideration s that arise for an owner in meeting their obligations as owner and as builder in a self-build situation.

A number of cases have, however, been brought to my attention whereby consumers have been quoted exorbitant charges for professional services in relation to residential construction projects.  The new regulations support improved competence and professionalism which will provide additional work opportunities for competent practitioners and construction professionals. While it is worthwhile for homeowners to have the home they invest in checked and inspected, the y should not have to pay a inflated rates or for excessive inspection services. <\/p><p>In this regard, I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, to prepare guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a single, stand-alone dwelling.

Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie<\/i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).   <\/p><p>Part A <b>of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations<\/b>sets out the legal requirements in relation to structure.

The materials to be used, e.g. concrete blocks, wall ties etc. are required to meet the specified minimum designations, strengths and other qualities, as set out in TGD A and the referenced standards.   <\/p><p>Part D sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials &hellip; which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations.   <\/p><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.   <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s national standard <i>I.S. 20:1987 Concrete Building Blocks<\/i><i>-<\/i><i>Part 1 Normal Density Blocks<\/i>was the relevant standard for concrete blocks in place from 1987 until 2003 when it was replaced by a harmonised European product standard for concrete blocks - <i>EN 771-3 aggregate concrete masonry units (dense and light weight aggregates)<\/i>. EN 771-3 was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 17 March 2003 and came into effect on 15 October 2003. However, as is normal in such circumstances, the provisions in I.S. 20: Part 1 continued to apply for a period of time (known as the co-existence period) to allow for transition from the national standard to the harmonised European standard.   <\/p><p>Harmonised European product standards provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics, the harmonised standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of a system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance including third party oversight (determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved) which the manufacturer is required to comply with.   The National Standards Authority of Ireland has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European product standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.   <\/p><p><i>Regulation (EU) No 305\/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89\/106\/EEC<\/i><i><\/i>requires manufacturers to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products which are covered by a harmonised standard or a European Technical Assessment. From 1 July 2013, manufacturers of construction products which are covered by harmonised European product standards are required, when placing a product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance for the product, and to affix the CE mark.     <\/p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the Construction Products Regulation.

In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers.    In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700084#WRJJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":1624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700085#WRKK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1625,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[22245\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700085#WRKK00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the strength of the Defence Forces for each of the years from 1960 to 1970.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1626,"content":"<p>The strength of the Defence Forces in each of the years from 1960 to 1970 is set out in the table.<\/p><p><b>Combined strength of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces 1960 - 1970<\/b><table><tr><th>Description <\/th><th>Year<\/th><th>Permanent Defence Force<\/th><th>Reserve Defence Force <\/th><th>Combined Total <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1960<\/td><td>8,812<\/td><td>23,917<\/td><td>32,729<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1961<\/td><td>8,450<\/td><td>23,449<\/td><td>31,899<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1962<\/td><td>8,332<\/td><td>22,460<\/td><td>30,792<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1963<\/td><td>8,302<\/td><td>21,803<\/td><td>30,105<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1964<\/td><td>8,190<\/td><td>22,256<\/td><td>30,446<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1965<\/td><td>8,375<\/td><td>22,288<\/td><td>30,663<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1966<\/td><td>8,249<\/td><td>21,588<\/td><td>29,837<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1967<\/td><td>8,319<\/td><td>21,297<\/td><td>29,616<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1968<\/td><td>8,226<\/td><td>21,587<\/td><td>29,813<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1969<\/td><td>8,256<\/td><td>21,620<\/td><td>29,876<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Strength at 31 December<\/td><td>1970<\/td><td>8,563<\/td><td>20,418<\/td><td>28,981<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700085#WRKK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700085#WRKK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[22396\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700085#WRKK00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of females in each rank in the Navy, Air Corps and the Army; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.

Twin rigged trawls have been practised by Irish fishermen for decades in both whitefish and nephrops fisheries. The advantage of a  twin-rigged trawl over a single trawl of equivalent dimensions is that it allows a similar area of seabed to be covered while reducing the drag of the gear and consequently the power required to tow it.  Over the last 2 to 3 years quad rigged trawls have widely replaced twin rigged trawls in the Irish Nephrops fishery. The principal reason the quad rig is being adopted so widely and so quickly appears to be that it allows fishermen to catch their Nephrops quota more efficiently than the twin rig.  Some industry members have expressed concerns about the use of this gear and its impact on the nephrops fishery.<\/p><p>  The matter has been considered by the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership (IFSRP) which comprises industry representatives, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) at its March meeting.  BIM has included quad rig trials as part of its work programme for 2014, which I understand have been undertaken.  When the work on the quad rig trials is completed, BIM will summarise current knowledge on this gear to inform a discussion at the IFSRP.  I will consider the views of the IFSRP on the use of this gear in the nephrops fishery and any recommendations received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700086#WRLL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":1722,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700086#WRLL03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1723,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[22862\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700086#WRLL03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to set out the position regarding payment owed to a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1057","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1724,"content":"<p>In order to comply with EU requirements, the 2009 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application of the person named was selected for a Cross Compliance inspection.

Mindful that the sector required additional, focused support, the Upland Sheep Payment (USP) was introduced, on a once-off basis, in 2009, with payments worth some &euro;7 million. The USP was replaced for the period 2010 to 2014, inclusive, by the Grassland Sheep Scheme, total payments in the period totalling &euro;83 million. Going forward, these GSS payments are being incorporated into the new Basic Payment Scheme, under which the vast majority of sheep farmers will also benefit from convergence in the initial five years of the BPS, beginning in 2015. In tandem to these measures, sizeable numbers of sheep farmers have benefited under the &euro;3 million Sheep Technology Adoption Programme since its inception in 2013 and will continue to benefit into the future.<\/p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73\/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme.<\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.<\/p><p>  I am considering applying this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements.<\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.  This is an outline of the approach I intend to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700087#WRMM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":1760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700087#WRMM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1761,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[23050\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700087#WRMM02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive an agri-environment options scheme payment; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1762,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 3) with effect from 1 May 2013.

Where, however, the removal of such links could, depending on the nature of the information concerned, have an impact on the legitimate interest of internet users interested in having access to the information, the Count held that a fair balance should be sought between that right and the data subject's rights.

The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":1839,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1840,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[22257\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which there is any further assessment of eligibility for temporary long-term residency in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1841,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, if the person whose details were supplied has made an application for asylum or subsidiary protection, the position is that it is not the practice to comment on such applications for so long as they are in the protection process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":1842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1843,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[22258\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding naturalisation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1844,"content":"<p>All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

In particular, these conditions require that an applicant is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; that he or she intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and has made a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State.

The matters raised have also been responded to in separate correspondence with my Department.<\/p><p>However, in relation to the broader concerns raised, I would point out that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which has completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.<\/i>The Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the Bill&rsquo;s wide-reaching structural reforms is reflected in the fact that the Bill, having been a key structural reform under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Programme, is now a key component of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs, <\/i>the <i>Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020 <\/i>and of the <i>National Reform Plan<\/i>.  I would highlight that the Bill, in three of the objectives it sets out in section 9 for the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, balances the focus of regulation more evenly to the benefit of consumers of legal services. It does this in terms of 'protecting and promoting the public interest; protecting and promoting the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services and, promoting competition in the provision of legal services in the State'.<\/p><p>Building on these consumer focussed objectives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication by the new Office of the Independent Adjudicator which will replace that of the existing Taxing-Master. These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.   The Bill also provides that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be bolstered by an independent complaints regime and an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. The new Authority will provide a first port of call that is entirely independent of the legal professional bodies for members of the public who may have complaints about solicitors or barristers - at present this is done through their respective professional bodies. Enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Bill will, therefore, create a clearer distinction between the historical representational role of the Law Society and the regulatory functions that are being conferred by the Bill on the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority in relation to solicitors. This will inspire greater public confidence in the independence of regulation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1849,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[22346\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to introduce laws targeting sex buyers to end exploitation, abuse and trafficking; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that it is nearly a year since the publication of the Oireachtas joint justice committee's report on this matter; if she will take urgent action to implement legislation which would protect women and girls from exploitation and trafficking into the sex trade; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1850,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[23141\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans for legislation on prostitution following the publication of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality report on prostitution here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1851,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[23340\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will table a Bill regarding laws targeting sex buyers to end exploitation, abuse and trafficking; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1852,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[23394\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding legislation (details supplied) which would protect women and girls from exploitation and trafficking into the sex trade and putting pimps and traffickers out of business; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1853,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 654, 698, 704 and 705 together.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that I have not yet had an opportunity to fully review this matter.

In that regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 4 weeks from date of receipt.  This is a considerable improvement on last year when processing times had reached 14 weeks.  I should also point out that the number of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) each year has risen from 187,864 in 2007 to 381,082 by the end of 2013. In the circumstances, and while acknowledging that improvements can always be made, I am of the view that the current processing time is within acceptable limits in the context of the delivery of an effective service.<\/p><p>  Garda Vetting applications are processed on a first-come, first serve basis in chronological order from date of receipt.  This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects. A full vetting check is conducted for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. Of course processing times will fluctuate upwards and downwards depending on seasonal demands and volumes received and, in some cases, depending on whether further enquiries have to be conducted with external Garda Stations or other agencies such as the Courts Service, Probation Service, HSE, etc.  These enquiries are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons such as verification of identity, updating of incomplete records, and establishing outcomes of investigations.<\/p><p>  In the context of improving the service, the Deputy may wish to note that there are now 174 whole-time equivalent staff assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU), an 87% increase on the staffing level at the end of December 2012 when 93 staff were assigned to the GCVU.  The development of an e-Vetting solution is also underway and this will facilitate the processing of applications in an e-format, thus removing the current time-consuming process of managing applications received manually.  Internal workshops in relation to testing and process development began in 2014 and are ongoing.  It is envisaged that there will be further engagement and testing with external organisations prior to full roll-out and implementation. It is anticipated that E-vetting will streamline the entire vetting process and greatly contribute to reducing processing times for vetting applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":1860,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1861,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[22371\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on a case (details supplied) regarding allegations of Garda corruption; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1862,"qnumday":700,"qnumall":"[23229\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700089#WROO04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an inquest on a case that raises serious issues regarding evidence found (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1863,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657 and 700 together.<\/p><p>  I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family concerned for the tragic loss of life in the case referred to by the Deputy.

Such persons may also be obliged to produce verification of identity before being granted admission to a casino premises.<\/p><p>  While there is currently no provision in Irish law for the licensing of casinos, there are currently 40 private member gaming clubs registered with my Department under the provisions of Section 109 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 as amended.

I am also aware that there has been a reduction in the number of practising solicitors, of whom over 1,000 are reported to remain unemployed, and this has been accompanied by some decline in the number of solicitors in practise who are in a position to support paid apprenticeships. However, notwithstanding these ongoing challenges and the hope that they will dissipate through ongoing economic recovery, it is my understanding that the Law Society has a long-standing scheme in place under which it provides support and guidance to prospective solicitor apprentices.  This includes a facility under which apprentices can, I understand, be matched-up with solicitors' firms who are able to register their apprenticeship vacancies with the Society for that specific purpose.  An area of the Society&rsquo;s website for members is also, I understand, set aside for solicitors apprentices. I would, therefore, hope that any person seeking a solicitors apprenticeship at this very challenging time will be able to augment their own efforts with the appropriate support of the Law Society in this regard.<\/p><p>  This is an area which is due to come under review. The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which has completed D&aacute;il Committee Stage, includes a number of provisions which relate to the professional education and training of legal practitioners. For example, under section 9 of the Bill, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority is charged, among other things, with keeping under review the admission requirements and policies of the Law Society relating to the solicitors' profession and the availability and quality of education and training (including ongoing training) for solicitors, including how and by whom such education and training is provided. In addition, section 30 of the Bill provides for the Authority to report on a range of matters following a public consultation and reporting process. These matters include, specifically, the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners and the manner in which such education and training is provided. I would expect that the issue of apprenticeships, including access to them and the availability of training contracts, will be among those aspects of the training and qualification of legal practitioners that will be kept under active review by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority - while also being addressed as part of the public consultations on the education and training of legal practitioners upon which a report is to provided by the Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700090#WRPP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ground Rents Payments","counter":1892,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700090#WRPP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1893,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[22584\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700090#WRPP01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to assist expired leaseholders; the advice she can offer to persons affected by this difficulty; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1894,"content":"<p>The position is that section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 introduced a prohibition on the creation of new leases reserving ground rents on dwellings. As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple in certain cases subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.<\/p><p>  The position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'. The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.

Arising out of the Irish Presidency of the EU and the Informal Meeting of Health Ministers, the EU Commissioner supported the call for an EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity to be developed by the EU High Level Group On Nutrition and Physical Activity. This Plan has been drafted and will be finalised in 2014.<\/p><p>SAGO has also developed a Report to bring our consumption of Top Shelf Foods into line with the Healthy Eating Guidelines. Measures include healthy vending machine policy, healthy school meals programme and voluntary codes of practice relating to the marketing of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. <\/p><p>I recently launched the safefood\/HI\/HSE three year Childhood Obesity Campaign &ndash; Childhood Obesity: Let&rsquo;s take it on &ndash; one small step at a time - which is designed to create greater awareness among parents about the threat of childhood overweight and obesity and provide practical tips to help address the problem with the ultimate aim of effecting behaviour change.  <\/p><p>The <i>Healthy Ireland <\/i>policy supports a whole-of-government approach to address the determinants and predictors of health and well-being, many of which fall outside the health sector, including those which are of relevance in the education sector. In addition to <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>, my Department is leading the implementation of Outcome 1: Healthy, Active Children, a priority commitment of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the policy framework for children and young people.  This includes development of an implementation plan and effective working arrangements to implement the policy and to ensure alignment with <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>. <\/p><p>Work has commenced on supporting improved child health and well-being in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the other partners in the education sector.

In Ireland, the Health Promoting School Initiative (as defined by the WHO) is lead by the HSE.  It operates at both primary and post-primary level. <\/p><p>In a Health Promoting School (HPS), health is viewed in its broadest sense, and includes the physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of health.  It recognises that health is influenced by many factors beyond the individual, and aims to create a setting that supports health and healthy choices.  It is a long-term initiative aimed at involving the school community - students, staff and parents\/guardians - in a whole-school approach to health and well-being.<\/p><p>The HPS process adopts a &lsquo;whole school approach&rsquo; that goes beyond the classroom and includes: <blockquote>- Creating a healthy physical and social school environment<br \/><br \/>- Building health skills and life competencies through the school curriculum and other learning opportunities<br \/><br \/>- Developing and implementing school policies that promote health and well-being <br \/><br \/>- Strengthening partnerships for health, including linkages to families and the wider school community.  <\/blockquote>The HSE's Health Promotion Officers support and guide schools throughout the process.  Health Promoting Schools is a key action outlined in the HSE - Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing Division Operational Plan for 2014, which committed to supporting the implementation of the initiative in 465 schools.

Only a very small proportion of people with discretionary medical cards, who have been reviewed recently, have been found to be ineligible for a medical card.  Of the discretionary cards in circulation in 2011, less than one tenth have been found to be ineligible on review.  On the other hand, even where medical expenses have been taken into account, some people have been found to be ineligible because their net income is in excess of the means thresholds, sometimes by hundreds of euro per week. <\/p><p>  In accordance with the legislation, medical cards are awarded to persons who suffer undue financial hardship in the arranging of GP services including where this arises as a result of a disease or an illness. <\/p><p>  The HSE established panel of Community Medical Officers to assist in the processing of applications for medical cards where the income guidelines are exceeded but where there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness or physical disability. The Medical Officers review evidence of necessary medical expenses provided by the applicant.  As appropriate, he or she liaises with general practitioners, hospital consultants and other health professionals so that costs relating to the health circumstances of the applicant can be taken fully into account.  <\/p><p>  Minister Reilly and I are conscious of the difficulties faced by the relatively small number of people who have been found to be ineligible.  At his request, the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs. This examination relates to all of the services and supports provided by the HSE and with regard to as much flexibility as is available at a local level.  In addition, additional information will be provided and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing the full range of supports from the Health Services.<\/p><p>  The clear intention is to maximise the supports that can be provided in each case to the fullest extent possible.

The regulations help to ensure that consumers obtain a minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase. At present, the minimum benefits cover access to a semi-private room in a public hospital, including in-patient consultant fees, and a wide range of acute treatments. This represents the minimum level of cover that must be offered to every insured person. While I have sympathy for patients who find that certain drugs are not covered, it is not the role of the Minister for Health to direct private health insurers as to which services or facilities they cover.  This is a commercial decision for the insurers themselves.<\/p><p>  Cover for medical expenses under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer. If the customer is not satisfied with any decision made by an insurer relating to the benefits payable under their contract, they should first discuss it with the insurer concerned. However, if the customer remains dissatisfied with the insurer's response, they may contact the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers, including health insurers. The service is provided free of charge to the complainant. The decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all parties unless the decision is appealed to the High Court.

","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2303,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  The Act provides that persons, who are unable to arrange GP services for themselves and family without undue hardship, having regard to their overall financial situation, can qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess the means and reasonable expenditure of the applicant, and his or her spouse or partner. <\/p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability, the HSE has discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, having regard to person's or the family&rsquo;s overall financial situation, even where the person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  As I have outlined, the 1970 Act established a financial means assessment and medical card eligibility is granted on the basis of the financial situation of the applicant.  The nature of a disease or illness an applicant may have is not the basis for granting eligibility and, therefore,  is not an indicator on the HSE's clients&rsquo; registers.   <\/p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders, regardless of  the card having been awarded on the basis of means or where discretion was involved, are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility and the HSE has a very structured protocol in place for the review process and makes every effort to ensure on-going engagement with clients during this process.  In order to have all of the circumstances of the applicant taken into account, it is necessary to have these reviews supported by a range of documentation and this requirement is clearly outlined on the application forms.  As a result, where such supporting documentation is not supplied, or is incomplete, to enable the assessment of an application, in accordance with the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application. <\/p><p>  The Long Term Illness Scheme is an illness\/condition based scheme under which Downs Syndrome is covered and for which entitlement applies, irrespective of means. Where persons with Down's Syndrome are not eligible for a medical card following an assessment of their means, the HSE can provide their full requirements in respect of prescribed medicines and appliances free of charge through this statutory entitlement.  Public dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and appliances are also available free of charge to children and in respect of any difficulties identified at child health or school health examinations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700099#WRYY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Eligibility","counter":2304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700099#WRYY02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2305,"qnumday":815,"qnumall":"[22703\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700099#WRYY02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"with regard to the nursing home support scheme, the reason the income of children and other relatives who live in the same house, is not taken into account; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. There is no, nor has there ever been, an entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition and, therefore, in accordance with the legislation, it is not possible for the HSE to award a medical card.<\/p><p>  The HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. This discretion must be exercised by the HSE in accordance with the legislation. However, the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service having regard to his or her means.  <\/p><p>  One of the key goals of the reform of the health system is to ensure that people receive health care according to their particular needs rather than based on their income. It underpins the importance of moving towards a health system based on universality of access.  These major reforms take time and Minister Reilly and I recognise the difficulties currently faced by those who are considered ineligible for a medical card. To this end, at Minister Reilly's request, the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs. This examination relates to all of the services and supports provided by the HSE and with regard to as much flexibility as is available at a local level.  <\/p><p>  In addition, additional information will be provided and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing the full range of supports from the Health Services. <\/p><p>  The clear intention is to maximise the supports that can be provided in each case to the fullest extent possible. The HSE is seeking to find the best way to achieve this in order to ensure families will receive the support they need.  I look forward to seeing these proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700102#WRBBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":2452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700102#WRBBB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":2453,"qnumday":863,"qnumall":"[22923\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700102#WRBBB02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"since February 2011 to February 2014 the number of persons who have Down syndrome that have lost their cards in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2454,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.

The new income limits were effective from 1st January 2014.

In this regard, the HSE has written to those 50,000 over-70s that it believes may be in excess of the new income limits.  Any over-70s that lose their medical card due to the budget changes will continue to have access to free GP services.  This is in line with the introduction, on a phased basis, of a universal GP service without fees, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.

This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. There is no, nor has there ever been, an entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition and, therefore, in accordance with the legislation, it is not possible for the HSE to award a medical card.<\/p><p>  The HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. This discretion must be exercised by the HSE in accordance with the legislation. However, the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service having regard to his or her means.   The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the medical costs of that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  <\/p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.

It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.

The Centre has been experiencing widely reported cash flow difficulties over recent weeks.  The Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022m in 2013 and received funding amounting to &euro;1.96m, resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000.  Projections by the Centre show that income of approximately &euro;1.8m is anticipated during 2014.  With such a level of financial support available it should be possible to work constructively to continue services and avoid the closure scenario that has been outlined.<\/p><p>  Following my reply to previous questions in the House, I requested that officials from my Department meet with senior representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal (which administers a number of childcare schemes on behalf of my Department) and Dublin City Child Care Committee to discuss the position.  Following on from this, a meeting was arranged with the Centre which took place on 20th May.  The meeting was attended by senior representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal, Dublin City Childcare Committee and representatives from the board and management of Darndale Belcamp Childcare Services Ltd.  The objective of this meeting was to ensure that all possible solutions to the present difficulties were explored.  Arising from this meeting, a detailed examination of the Centre's costs, the funding available and the range and level of services provided is being undertaken.  Representatives from Pobal and Dublin City Child Care Committee are meeting this week with representatives from the board and management of Darndale Belcamp Childcare Services to further this process.<\/p><p>  In parallel, a wider examination will be undertaken of the level and range of early years services supported by the State in the Darndale\/Belcamp\/Moatview area generally.  The Child and Family Agency, Pobal, Dublin City and Fingal Child Care Committees will work jointly in this regard as a priority.  I indicated in my previous response to the House that I would expect that the Agency would be open to providing some further cash prepayments due to the Centre, if this is of assistance.  I am pleased to confirm that the Agency has agreed to make additional prepayments to the end of August.  This will be of assistance to the Centre and should allow the necessary time and space to examine the issues involved in greater detail.  I want to acknowledge the support of the Agency and the commitment by the various parties to the process which I have outlined.<\/p><p>  With regard to the level of salary paid to senior management at the Centre, I am advised by the Child and Family Agency that the Centre employs one manager and one deputy manager whose salaries are &euro;62,816 and &euro;56,331 per annum respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700110#WRKKK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2828,"qnumday":994,"qnumall":"[22348\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700110#WRKKK02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his attention has been drawn to that due to a cut in funding to an aftercare service for children with special needs in a club (details supplied) the service was forced to close as a result; if the possibility of continuing the service has been considered by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2829,"content":"<p>Funding for the service described by the Deputy is a matter for the Department of Health.

No other form of funding is available under the scheme, the key objective of which is to benefit children through providing access to preschool education.  The standard capitation fee paid to participating services is &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week per eligible child is available to preschool services with more highly qualified staff.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the preschool provision is available to parents free of charge.  Preschool services participating in the programme can charge parents for additional services provided these are clearly optional to parents and appropriate programme based activities continue to be provided to children not availing of such services during the preschool year hours.<\/p><p>  There are in the region of 4,300 preschool services participating in the programme with new services applying to enter the programme each year.  The funding provided under the programme is a guaranteed source of income, paid in advance, and is an important support to services at this time.  Services applying to enter the programme should be satisfied that they can meet the full cost of providing the preschool year from the capitation provided.<\/p><p>  The ECCE programme represents an investment of almost &euro;170 million annually in preschool services and in light of the current economic situation there are no proposals to increase this provision.  My Department provides annual funding to seven voluntary childcare organisations in the childcare sector, who provide support to childcare services throughout the country.  This funding, which will amount to over &euro;2.6 million  in 2014, enables the voluntary organisations to provide a range of support services to their members, including on-going training supports.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that as part of the childcare quality agenda aimed at improving the quality of childcare services, new qualification requirements for childcare staff working directly with children were announced last year.  A minimum qualification of Level 5 (or equivalent) on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) will be required for all staff working with children in preschool services and the minimum qualification for all preschool leaders delivering the free preschool year under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from Level 5 to Level 6 (or equivalent) on the NFQ.  The new qualification requirements will apply to all new services from September 2014, and to all existing services from September 2015.<\/p><p>  To support staff who are seeking to meet the new qualifications requirement, funding of &euro;3 million is being made available over the two years 2014\/2015 under the new Learner Fund which was launched in March this year.  The Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs).  Issues relating  to workforce development, curricular support and capitation, will be considered as part of Ireland's first-ever Early Years strategy, work on which is at an advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700110#WRKKK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2836,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 998 and 999 answered with Question No. 993.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2838,"qnumday":1000,"qnumall":"[22667\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014052700111#WRLLL00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide details of any funding his Department may have available for persons to apply for in order to set up a mother and toddler group for children.","asker":"1058","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2839,"content":"<p>Funding of &euro;0.25 million is being provided in 2014 to support the Parent and Toddler Initiative which is administered by the City and County Childcare Committees.

My Department has no responsibility in relation to the sustainability of individual services.  I am not aware of any representations from Tallaght Hospital to my Department in relation to the child care facility referred to by the Deputy.  However a number of written representations by and on behalf of parents who use the facility have been received.<\/p><p>  The recent enactment through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 of amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 underpins a number of key reforms being introduced as part of the Preschool Quality Agenda.  The amended legislation strengthens the current inspection regime, provides a statutory basis for the registration of early years services, and also provides for the setting of minimum qualification standards for staff working with children in early years services.  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these are currently being finalised.  New National Quality Standards will also be published.  It is not intended to impose any additional costs on services as a result of the new regulations, other than an increase in the annual fee payable by services to the Early Years Inspectorate.  In the case of the service in question, the increase in the fee payable is expected to be in the region of &euro;80 per annum.<\/p><p>  My Department has introduced measures to support training for child care staff to enable them to upskill to meet the increased qualification requirements and &euro;3 million is being made available over the next two years for this initiative.

My Department is working with the Early Years Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach.  I am confident that these reforms will provide for a more consistent and robust preschool inspection regime.
