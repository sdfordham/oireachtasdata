While it is good to see that Galway City Council has indicated that its new aquadam will be deployed at the Spanish Arch in order to alleviate matters, if bad weather accompanies the flooding, that might not be sufficient to prevent the repeat of previous flooding.  In light of that, I ask the Minister of State to outline where the national flood risk management programme now stands.  I understand that public meetings are taking place to develop a regional plan but there is a great need for these plans to be finalised and the necessary funding be put in place.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, to commit to providing whatever funding would be required for remedial and repair work should the forecasted floods become a reality in Galway and the west.<\/p><p>Would it be possible to get a statement on the current state of affairs in regard to the River Clare in Claregalway?

The Office of Public Works has arrangements in place with consultants to provide a tidal and storm surge forecasting service for the coast of Ireland to local authorities and to other relevant stakeholders during the autumn and winter period.  This service is now operating for the 2015 to 2016 autumn and winter period.  This service is provided twice daily and results are presented via a project website, which is password restricted, in the form of a surge, astronomical tide and total water level time series prediction approximately 65 hours in advance.  That provides advanced information to local authorities.  The service currently provides a low resolution storm surge forecast via website at 15 locations around the national coastline together with a high resolution forecast in Dundalk Bay, Galway Bay, Wexford Harbour, Cork Harbour and the Shannon Estuary.  High tide advisory notices are issued from time to time as deemed necessary by the OPW during periods of anticipated combined high tides and storm surge.  The OPW is monitoring closely the current surge forecasts for the upcoming high astronomical tides expected between Saturday, 26 September, and Friday, 2 October, and will issue a high tide advisory notice if deemed necessary in the event of anticipated coastal flood risk.<\/p> <p>Following the severe weather from 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014, which caused widespread damage across the southern and western seaboards, the Government decided on 11 February 2014 to make available up to &euro;69.5 million based on estimates provided for repair works by local authorities for a programme of repair and remediation works to be carried out by those local authorities to roads, coastal protection and flood defences and other public infrastructure damaged in those storms.  Of the total amount available, up to &euro;19.6 million was made available through the Office of Public Works for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.  A further &euro;48.7 million was made available through other Departments for restoration of damaged roads, local authority infrastructure, tourism, amenity and community infrastructure and piers and harbours, including those owned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, and for other transport infrastructure, including Irish Rail, Shannon Airport and the Irish Coast Guard.  A further &euro;1.2 million was made available for repair to OPW's own infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government wrote to all affected local authorities indicating that, based on the estimates submitted by them to the Department, the amounts being made available to the councils to undertake the necessary repairs works, including the amounts available via the OPW in respect of the cost of repairs to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure in the country.  Local authorities submitted programmes of works to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and other Departments and the OPW indicating how they proposed to spend the allocation made available to them.  The OPW has also written to the local authorities indicating that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash flow issues, it would consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% where a contract for works had been made. <\/p> <p>Of the &euro;19.6 million made available via the OPW, approximately &euro;13.7 million was allocated to the local authorities in counties Clare, Galway and Mayo, reflecting the severe damage done in those counties.  To date, the local authorities have drawn down over &euro;8.6 million of the full allocation of &euro;19.6 million available to them from the OPW.  The allocation is expected to be fully drawn down by the end of 2015.  A large number of the projects included in the programme of works submitted to the local authorities are now completed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Irish coastal protection strategy study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion and flood risk along the entire national coastline, and this information is available to all local authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties, including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, implementation of coastal protection works, both of a structural and non-structural nature.  This office has provided funding to Clare, Galway, Louth, Sligo and Wexford for coastal risk management studies of main at-risk areas identified by these counties.  It must be emphasised that the management of problems of coastal protection in any particular area is first and foremost a matter for the relevant local authority.  With regard to the question of upgrading existing built defences or constructing new defences, this would depend primarily on the council's assessment of the measures that would be appropriate at a particular location.  Local authorities must assess the problem in the first instance and, if it is considered that specific measures and works are required, it is open to them to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection works under the Office of Public Works' minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  <br\/><br\/>In addition to the storm damage repair funding, which is a one-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition, the OPW operates a capital works programme for the provision of flood defences nationally.  In the six years from 2009 to 2014, the OPW has expended more than &euro;250 million of taxpayers' money under the programme on the development and implementation of major flood relief schemes, the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme and the minor flood mitigation and coastal works programmes.  In addition to the capital works programme, we also carry out a maintenance programme on all arterial drainage schemes.  Included in the major flood relief schemes being advanced are coastal schemes at Skibbereen and Clonakilty.<br\/><br\/>The OPW is currently undertaking, as the Senator says, the national catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM, which is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU floods directive and forms the strategic focus of national flood policy.  Engineering consultants have been appointed to implement the programme through six regional studies.  Local authorities and other stakeholders are also involved in partnership with the OPW on steering groups and progress groups across the six study areas.  This programme, which is vast and is focusing on 300 areas for further assessment, including 90 coastal areas, involves the production of predictive flood risk and hazard mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  Under the programme, the draft maps have been produced and are already online for all to see and were the subject of a programme of local public consultation which concluded in April 2015.  The flood maps will be finalised following a national consultation scheduled for late 2015.  A programme of local public consultation on the preliminary flood risk management options is under way.  Further information is available on <i>cfram.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>As part of CFRAM, a condition survey of flood defence assets is being undertaken for entry into a flood defence database.  I would also make the point that, in the context of capital, this will require significant investment of possibly up to &euro;1 billion over ten years.  As a country we currently spend about &euro;42 million a year on flood mitigation measures.  In fairness to the last Government and this one, that is a level that has been maintained through difficult years.  We now need to see that seriously increase so that we can deliver the CFRAM programme.  The programme is making significant progress and we expect by the spring of next year to be rolling out the solutions to those 300 areas, where there are possible solutions.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the events that may happen in Galway in relation to astronomical tides, we will continue to closely monitor them and we will keep in touch with the Senator on that.  I will update the Senator on Claregalway in the next round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#C00200","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

Does the Minister of State have an update on the Clare River situation?  Many people living in the Claregalway area are at a loss as to when this is going to happen.

That will provide a roadmap for this and future Governments to deliver once and for all on the major infrastructural projects that need to be delivered in relation to flood mitigation.<\/p> <p>The Senator also touched on the issue of flood insurance.  There are a range of issues related to flooding that fall well outside the remit of the Office of Public Works.  Flood forecasting falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Flood insurance and insurance policies are the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  I have reconvened the interdepartmental group which brings together all the Departments with responsibility for various elements of what I call the whole of Government approach we need to take and that is due to report to Cabinet early next year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In relation to Claregalway, I sense and share the frustration of residents in Senator Naughton's part of the country.

That is where that is at.  I hope it does not take much longer.  I expect that works can start at the end of this year or early next year.  I am very much aware that residents want the work to start as quickly as possible but from an OPW perspective the funding is fully in place and it is in our profiles right up to 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#D00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","time":1443015000,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#E00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for accepting the matter.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.  My matter relates specifically to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and while I accept it is not within the Minister of State's area of responsibility, I appreciate him coming to give a response.  The matter relates to the beef genomics scheme on which I have consulted with suckler farmers throughout most of the north west of the country.  The scheme is turning out to be totally unworkable and its implementation threatens the quality of weanling beef output in the north west.  I can only provide examples from counties that are close to mine.  In Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim some 12,800 farmers were eligible to apply for the scheme but fewer than 5,500 have applied.<\/p> <p>The cost of the scheme is &euro;52 million.  It was designed to assist farmers but, in effect, the science behind it will adversely impact on the type of weanling that is being produced by farmers throughout the north west.  Times are very difficult for farmers in the north west.  We have smaller holdings, longer winters and land that is of a lesser quality to other parts of the country but yet have been renowned for breeding the highest quality stock for export and processing for many years.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State might be aware, but the Minister will certainly be aware, that in recent weeks farmers are being informed about the grading of the cows.  They are finding that the cows that are producing the highest possible quality of weanling are being given a grading of two stars.  If the scheme works in the way the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, the IFA at a senior level and the Department seem to want it to work, we are going to end up with a much more maternal-focused herd rather than a paternal one.  We need a healthy mix.  In the first instance the scheme does not help the small farmers of the north west and the other parts of the country and does not serve to increase the quality of the type of output from the north west, which is already renowned as producing the finest store cattle and replacement cattle in Ireland.  Something must be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>A total of &euro;8 million of the &euro;52 million will go not to farmers but to the genomics testing.  One wonders what the ultimate contribution will be.  The Minister of State may know, but the Minister, Deputy Coveney, certainly knows, the money is derived from Pillar 2, in terms of funding under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  There may have been a big uptake on the scheme generally as there are very large dairy and suckler farmers in the south of the country but it is not working in the north west.  It would be much better for the 12,800 eligible farmers in the north west where testing costs approximately &euro;1,000, if that money were made available through the payment to areas of natural constraint, what is traditionally known as the disadvantaged area scheme payment, which was substantially reduced.  It was originally introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s to keep people on the land and to ensure the continuation of production.  Production has been of the highest quality in the north west in terms of weanling production.  Some 40% of the country&rsquo;s entire output of young calves comes from the area and that is now under threat.  The scheme is unworkable and is costing money.  It is not serving the purpose we need it to serve.  I appeal to the Minister of State to impress upon the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to undertake a full review of the scheme at least in the north west where it is not working.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marc MacSharry:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While I appreciate that it is not the Minister of State's line and while I appreciate him being here on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it would be remiss of me not to mention while he is here that the announced scheme for villages and towns is a very sad indictment of any Government, particularly this one.  It is less than &euro;190,000 per county, per year over six years.  Every Government over the past 30 years has been guilty of not adequately resourcing our regions and rural areas to enable them to reach their potential.  If any Government is committed to doing that, it needs to think in terms of billions over a six-year period to strategically target resources for the regions to empower them to reach their potential.  I hope the Minister of State will take that on board.  <\/p><p>First and foremost is the necessary review of the beef genomics scheme.  There is &euro;52 million there that I do not believe is going to serve an adequate purpose.

I am pleased to be here on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who regrets that he cannot be here.<\/p> <p>The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, was launched by the Minister on 5 May last.  It is part of Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and involves funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years and builds on the State's investment in data recording and genomics in recent years.  It aims to address widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the Irish suckler herd, reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of Ireland's beef production and make a positive contribution to the future viability of suckler farmers and the national suckler herd.<\/p> <p>Beef accounts for 35% of the gross output of the agriculture sector.  It is probably the most important product at farm level in Ireland.  Beef exports in 2014 amounted to 524,000 tonnes, worth &euro;2.27 billion.  The suckler herd is a critical component of this industry.  It is beef from the suckler herd that has principally enabled us to succeed on international retail markets.  It is important, therefore, that policy at EU and national level recognises the challenges and opportunities facing suckler beef farmers and provides the infrastructure to help it to respond and thrive.<\/p> <p>The BDGP is a response to these challenges and opportunities and particularly challenges associated with improved breeding performance, including for maternal traits such as cow fertility, and the very onerous requirements to reduce the percentage of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions which comes from the agriculture sector.  Improving the genetics of the suckler herd can make a positive contribution in both of these areas while also improving the economic viability of suckler farming.  The BDGP provides targeted support to suckler farmers and builds on the success of the State's investment of over &euro;9 million in the beef data programme in both 2013 and 2014 and on the success of the pilot beef genomics scheme, which involved investment of around &euro;23 million last year.<\/p> <p>Participants in the BDGP will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for the first 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each hectare thereafter, up to a maximum payable hectarage.  This is a strong commitment from this Government to the beef sector in Ireland over the next six years.  In return for this payment, participants will be required to undertake six actions, some of which will be well known to suckler farmers through their participation in previous schemes.  Participants will be required to complete surveys and submit information related to criteria such as milking ability, docility, size and animal vigour.  Farmers will be very familiar with these surveys which were previously part of the beef data programme operated in recent years.  Participants will be required to genotype animals on their farms which have been selected by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his or her holding in 2014.  These are known as the farmer's reference animals.  I should add that the cost of the genotyping tag has been significantly reduced from the 2014 beef genomics scheme and now stands at &euro;22 - a drop of over 26%.  <\/p> <p>The replacement strategy that farmers must undertake as part of the scheme requires them to ensure that a certain percentage of the animals on their herd at particular deadlines are of four or five-star rating on the Euro star ratings system.  It should be noted that most farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for replacement animals on their herds with significant numbers of four and five-star animals already in scheme participants' herds.  <\/p> <p>In recent weeks, the ICBF has issued every scheme applicant with detailed reports on the current status of animals in their herds.  Participants will receive similar information related to the scheme and their individual herd on an ongoing basis.  This is in addition to a training programme which will be rolled out over the next 12 months.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Finally, farmers will be required to complete a carbon navigator on their farm with an approved adviser.  The carbon navigator will not cost anything for participants to complete and farmers will be paid &euro;166 to attend the training course for their time and expense in doing so.<\/p><p>The Minister does not agree that this scheme poses any threat to the quality of weanling that will be produced in the north west, quite the opposite is true.  The data from ICBF and all of the research to date clearly show that progeny, that is, the weanlings, from four and five-star cows perform significantly better than weanlings from one and two-star cows.  These cows have more milk, more calves and shorter calving intervals.  They produce heavier weanlings which are ultimately slaughtered earlier and with more weight.  These are the animals which can add value to farms in the west and we should encourage their use as replacements.<\/p><p>In the context of reviewing the scheme with suckler farmers - the issue Senator MacSharry raised - the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has committed to establishing a group to monitor the operation of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, with a view to feeding into a mid-term review.  Farm bodies and other stakeholders have already been invited to nominate representatives to this group and it is expected that a first meeting of the group will take place in the near future.  This is in addition to the range of clarifications made by the Minister upon the launch of the scheme.  It is clear from the large number of applications received for the BDGP that farmers recognise the benefits this scheme can deliver locally and nationally.  Just under 30,000 farmers applied to join the scheme and the small number that have since exited it, equivalent to approximately 2% of applicants, is in line with previous suckler-based schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>I reiterate, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that the BDGP involves an investment of &euro;300 million in addressing some of the key challenges facing the beef sector in Ireland.  The BDGP is the first measure of its kind anywhere in the EU and will place Ireland at the head of the international market place as a producer of high-quality, environmentally-sustainable beef.  It will also boost promotional initiatives such as Origin Green, which has been a central part of Bord Bia's marketing and promotion strategy in international markets.  This scheme is to be welcomed and I think the large number of applications received confirms this.

I respect fully its history and its traditions and recall with fondness the people who served as very effective managers, engineers and county council colleagues.  Overall, they did a very fine job in the management of County Cork.  I think back to various chairpersons of the council whom I served with and those stretching back long before my time.  They include significant dignitaries of State, such as former Deputy Martin Corry from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and William Broderick from east Cork, who chaired Cork County Council for over 30 years.  We had people such as Philip Burton, Frank Crowley, Donal Creed and many others, who all ran a very effective local authority in conjunction with councillors and management.  The interaction between councillors and the community was very much at the core of that success story.  There was a feeling that local government was really local.<\/p><p>Likewise, Cork city, with its mayoral traditions stretching back generations, includes figures of significance in Nationalist history such as Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain and Terence MacSwiney, who served with distinction in the city hall as lord mayors of the city.  In more recent years, Cork city was served with huge and effective distinction by a wide variety of figures, including the current Opposition leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and I think in particular of the late Hugh Coveney, Jim Corr and many others whose leadership of their city council resulted in a huge dividend for the city.  Again, there was a city lord mayor and a city council working closely with the people.  I believe that concept of the people being close to local government - of local being local - made a very significant and positive difference.<\/p><p>One of the difficulties I have in understanding where the Minister is coming from is that, while this report is being considered and the Minister seems to have given it some degree of green light, at the same time, he has announced an operational review of the new local government arrangements under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  I am firm believer in local government reform.   Having been a member of a local authority, I know much could be improved.  However, and I say this not in any way as part of a political point-scoring exercise, I believe the butchering of our local authorities and the decision in 2014 to rid our county of town councils will be shown to have been a grievous error.  While some of the town councils could have been more effective, the baby was thrown out with the bath water.  We now have local authority areas in our county that are 60 to 70 miles long.  That is no longer local government.  If this bare majority proposal by the review group goes ahead, we will not even have local government as planned in Cork; we will have an experiment in regional government.<\/p><p>I come to the debate as somebody who, when I looked at the concept of change in Cork initially, could see a purpose for a single authority.  However, I was looking at it as a very different single authority.  I was not looking at it as a chamber of 80 or 90 members, who would then be split into three parts and would probably be working against rather than for each other.  I wanted a new form of local government.  What has been proposed, sadly, may offer the worst of all worlds.  It is not a strong combined unit and it certainly is not local.  Before he makes any decision, I hope the Minister will sit down with all of the stakeholders - the councils and the communities - because this is a very major step.  I believe it is an experiment in regional government at the expense of local government.<\/p><p>If we were starting from scratch and there had been no 2014 changes in local government, we would be talking about strengthening local government, strengthening communities and ensuring that local government is real and is local.  The Minister of State has travelled as much of the world as I, probably more.  I believe one of the features of much of Europe and North America is the strength of local government.  Every community has its council, its mayor or its representation.  What is now being suggested here will blow all of that apart.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I concede I do not have the answers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Bradford:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not think any of us yet has the answers and the report does not provide sufficient answers.

Since receiving the report on 2 September 2015, the Minister has had an opportunity to consider it and on 8 September 2015 he signalled his agreement with its main recommendation to establish a new unified Cork local authority.  The Minister is persuaded that a unified local authority for Cork has the potential to achieve important benefits, above all strengthening local government.  Other anticipated advantages include eliminating administrative duplication, securing greater efficiency through economies of scale, promoting economic and social development and, ultimately, improving service delivery.<\/p><p>The case for unification rests primarily in stronger, more effective local government speaking with one voice that can deliver a much better future for the people of Cork in terms of social and economic progress and quality of life.  However, it is important to stress that the model that is being proposed for Cork involves more than just a merger, as in the case of Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford.  For example, the report points out that there would be a strong case for major devolution of powers to what would be by far the largest unit of local government within the State.  Fragmentation and weak local government structures have inhibited devolution up to now; stronger more coherent local authorities can help to reverse this and reduce centralisation.  The report also sees scope for stronger leadership of a new authority and a continued role is envisaged for the Lord Mayor of Cork in providing civic leadership and underlining the status, customs and traditions of the city.<\/p><p>Since publication, much has been made in public commentary of the fact that this is a majority report.  However, this portrayal masks important aspects about which the committee was in full agreement, for example, the conclusion that retaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is not a realistic option and the need to acknowledge and develop Cork city as a driving force in economic and social development of the region.<\/p><p>The requirement for a new enlarged metropolitan area was also a matter of agreement but the committee differed on how best to achieve this.  A boundary extension, while maintaining two authorities, would really mean the city taking a substantial share of the county's population and resources, with implications for the future viability of the county.  Equally, the suggestion that Cork city would suffer economically or socially within a unified authority is not well founded.  It is essential that there be a clear overall vision for Cork and an approach that will achieve added value and strengthen local government.  Unification can achieve all of the benefits of addressing the boundary issue while avoiding the disadvantages and complexities which would arise for both authorities by extending the city boundary only.  A unified authority, with improved strategic capacity, can act as a leader and facilitator of change to support and develop Cork and the wider region in social, economic and environmental terms and can facilitate the delivery of efficient and effective customer services through innovative local government.<\/p><p>I remind the House that, in signalling his agreement with the main recommendation to establish a unified authority rather than simply extending the city boundary, the Minister indicated that he would give further consideration to all of the details in the report.  A considerable amount of work remains to be done to develop further the committee's high-level recommendation.  The detail of what a unified system of local government in Cork would involve - including governance arrangements, functions, and arrangements to maintain the status of the city - must be fully developed as, indeed, must the issue of addressing, as necessary, issues raised in the minority report.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand that the Minister will be making a submission to the Government on the approach to be followed in light of this further consideration of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#J00200","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is simply responding on behalf the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and has no discretion in respect of his response.

In the report of 2 March when an inspection took place, HIQA highlighted many issues the director of nursing, Ms Silke, was well aware of but for which no funding had been forthcoming from the HSE.  I have a long association with the Sacred Heart Hospital, having been there at the opening of the new unit in the 1970s, as a former Minister of State in the Department of Health and as a Deputy and former chairman of the western health board.  I have always fully supported this fabulous institution in Roscommon.<\/p><p>I was also anxious to have the facility called the Sacred Heart Hospital, as opposed to Sacred Heart home, because it carries out the work of a step-down hospital and is a tremendous support to the work of the acute county hospital in Roscommon with which it works closely.  The Minister will be aware of the facilities there.  The hospital cares for 95 residents and has 35 full-time nursing staff, 48 health care assistants, 11 interns, cooks, kitchen staff, laundry staff, clerical staff, maintenance staff and two physiotherapists.  All of this is provided at the Sacred Heart Hospital.  The overall medical care is under Dr. Gerry O'Meara, consultant geriatrician and registrar, and staff.  All temporal and religious needs are cared for, with mass every day in the beautiful church on the site.<\/p><p>The immediate crisis is that from 7 September 2015, no new admissions are purported to be allowed.  However, I got an update on the situation this morning and have been informed by the management of the hospital that there is no block on admissions and it is still admitting patients.  The licence has not been renewed and they have been told it is in the process of being renewed.  The immediate challenge is the provision of approximately &euro;170,000 for remedial works - partitions, doors, toilets, etc. - which will ensure registration will continue, pending the allocation of a major capital injection from the Department. <\/p><p>I understand that in the past few days a proposal has been made to provide approximately &euro;400 million over the next five years for the upgrade of State institutions like the Sacred Heart Hospital, Roscommon.  Knowing the background situation in Roscommon, the Minister is aware that his predecessor, Deputy James Reilly, gave a commitment to maintaining the 24-hour accident and emergency facility, but that was closed despite the commitments given by the Taoiseach and Deputy Gilmore.  The people of Roscommon will not stand idly by and allow lightning strike twice.  If the new 50-bed single occupancy rooms with full ancillary services and facilities are not provided, at an estimated cost of up to &euro;13 million, the future of the Sacred Heart Hospital is in jeopardy.<\/p><p>The people of Roscommon have attended meetings in large numbers and have highlighted the issues on the Vincent Browne show.  I am confident the money will be forthcoming.  I have pressed my party's shadow spokepersons to ensure there is provision in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto for major capital investment.  This will be provided, but we must see this as an issue of putting people before politics.  I ask the Minister for an indication of the allocation and ask him to approve that allocation in the budget to secure the future of the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#K00500","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

If funding is provided, the project is shovel ready and the HSE knows that.  It does not need to acquire land to build these extra units.  It is amazing that the project is under threat and that the hospital faces downsizing because of its four-bedded units.  There are four-bedded units in every hospital in the country, but will the same apply to them down the road?  If the investment is not put in place, there will be no more admissions, which will eventually bring about the closure of the Sacred Heart Hospital.<\/p><p>No complaints were made by patients about the facility.

I am taking the debate this on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is abroad on Government business.<\/p> <p>The policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  If it becomes necessary for an older person to move to a nursing home, appropriate accommodation must be available that meets his or her care needs and matches his or her wishes and preferences.  <\/p> <p>The Health Service Executive, HSE, is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at the Sacred Heart Hospital in County Roscommon.  <\/p> <p>The facility provides services for 80 residents in ongoing care.  Many of the residents have complex and challenging conditions and almost half have had a diagnosis of dementia, psychiatric conditions or other complex medical needs.  There are 15 beds used for rehabilitation, respite or palliative care.  The rehabilitation service is led by a consultant.  This service makes an important contribution to facilitating patients to move from acute hospitals to a more appropriate care centre when they no longer need acute care.  <\/p> <p>The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and monitor safety and quality in Ireland's health and personal social care services.  Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, private and voluntary - have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  The most recent HIQA report on the hospital was published last July.  Inspectors found that the centre was well managed.  Residents and family members told inspectors that they were very happy with the services provided.  While HIQA praised the care provided, inspectors expressed concern about environmental standards and staffing levels at night.  The issue of staffing levels has been addressed and is being progressed.  During August the HSE received a notice of proposal from HIQA to restrict admissions.  The HSE has responded to this notice and is in ongoing contact with HIQA regarding the registration.  This, of course, is a process that inevitably ends up in court.  It is not one in respect of which I can make any ministerial direction, nor do I have the power to do so.  <\/p> <p>As is in the case of the Sacred Heart Hospital, residents in public facilities and their families are generally very happy with the standard of care provided.  They frequently choose such facilities, even when other alternatives are available.  However, a number of buildings are very old and it can be difficult or very costly to fully adapt them in line with modern practice.  Demands on public capital funding generally exceed what can realistically be provided.  Only a finite amount of funding can be provided for public capital investment and there are many competing demands across government for the funds available.  However, the Minister of State and I have made the strongest possible case for investment in community nursing units.  My Department will work with the HSE to direct what does become available in the most effective way possible, with the safety and welfare of residents always being our top priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#M00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Minister has acknowledged the excellent work of the staff at the Sacred Heart Hospital which is a very popular location for patients.

He has informed me that remedial works worth &euro;170,000 would not be sufficient to satisfy the HIQA requirements and that what is required is either a total replacement of the facility or major refurbishment.  I cannot give any commitment at this stage on that, and I would not be honest if I did so.  The simple reason for that is that I do not know what is available for health in the capital budget yet.  That has not been signed off by the Government.  It is intended that it will be signed off next week, at which stage I will know what capital is available for the health sector for the period between 2016 and 2021.  I will have to sit down with Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the HSE and everyone else to prioritise and decide what aspects might be addressed by direct Exchequer funding and what aspects could be addressed by public&ndash;private partnership.  However, I am not willing to make a commitment I cannot stand over.  I cannot make one at this stage.<br\/><br\/>Senator Kelly mentioned that there are people in four-bed rooms.  He asked whether this is happening throughout the country.  It is.  There are two facilities in my constituency in a similar position.  Neither has funding to be replaced at this stage.  Therefore, it is an issue that applies across the country.  It is deemed no longer appropriate to have people in long-term care in four, six or 12-bed wards.  People may have their own opinions on that but the general view is that it may be acceptable for somebody in hospital for a week or two but not for an individual for whom hospital has become home.  In the latter case, the view is that one should have a private <i>en suite<\/i>room or certainly a room with no more than two beds.  That is the current standard.  However, as Senators will appreciate, many of these facilities date back hundreds of years.

As of last Tuesday, 15 September, north County Dublin, an area with a population of 350,000, has been without the National Ambulance Service.  There has been no coverage whatsoever since 7 o'clock last Tuesday owing to the fact that a new ambulance base in Lissenhall north of Swords which cost &euro;500,000 has not been fitted out.  The HSE stated at a meeting today that it might be ready in December.  The issue is bad forward planning.  The Department has not even requested any of the fittings or equipment required to run an ambulance base.  As a result, HSE ambulances based at St. James's Hospital in Dublin city are expected to take calls from as far north as Balbriggan.  This is unacceptable and I am writing to the Minister about the matter.  I ask the Leader's office to also take it up with the Minister.  It is simply unacceptable that nearly 500,000 people in the Dublin region will be served by only one ambulance, provided by Dublin Fire Brigade.<\/p> <p>There have been a number of announcements on transport and transport policy within Dublin.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to the House at the appropriate time when the final announcements are made for a proper debate on the Government's future transport plans, not just for Dublin but for also the country.<\/p> <p>Just before we returned after the recess we saw the publication of the interim report of the Fennelly commission on the retirement or sacking, depending on one's perspective, of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan.  It is fair to point out that, judging from any of the polls taken, the general public does not believe the Taoiseach's version or his accounts of what happened at the time.  None of us does.  I doubt anybody could believe his surprise that the former Garda Commissioner had decided to retire.  Certainly, the former Secretary General, Mr. Purcell, was sent to give a message to the former Garda Commissioner that he had to step down.  However, one person with a unique insight into what happened and the decisions made by the Cabinet, particularly the advice that it and the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, was given, is the the Attorney General, Ms Marie Whelan.  She will have a unique and important perspective of what really happened around that time.  It is important, therefore, that she answer question about some of the contradictory evidence given and the fact that her evidence had to be changed four times during the course of the commission of investigation.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that, under Standing Order 56, the Attorney General be invited to the House to answer questions about her role as the senior legal person in the State and senior adviser to the Government, the Cabinet, the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach.  Standing Order 56 clearly states a Minister of the State or the Attorney General may attend and be heard in the Seanad.  That Standing Order should be invoked, as it would provide an opportunity for the Attorney General to get her point of view across and answer questions from Members across the House who are very concerned, as is the general public, about the events that occurred around the time of the retirement or resignation of the former Garda Commissioner.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This needs to be addressed----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#P00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Q00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>----- so I am formally proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Attorney General, under Standing Order 56, be invited to attend and be heard in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Q00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Before speaking to the Order of Business, I join with colleagues in expressing tribute to Senator Jimmy Harte on the announcement of his resignation.  On behalf of my Labour Party colleagues, I echo the warm sentiments expressed about Jimmy by the Leader and Senator O'Brien.  Jimmy is well-known and well-loved by all of us.  He has had a long and distinguished political career.  He was first elected to the council in Letterkenny in 1994 and since then has been very much a leading light in his community in Letterkenny.  He is a keen sportsman and all of us are very well aware of that.  He ran many marathons.  He was chairman at one time of Finn Harps Football Club and has played a range of different sports.<\/p> <p>As a Seanad colleague, Jimmy was an exemplary colleague and a true gentleman.  I think all of us, on both sides of the House, were extremely shocked at his accident two years ago.  We have been following his progress since then with keen interest.  All of us wish him and his family, his wife, Mary, and their four children, the very best for his continued good health and full recovery and wish them the very best into the future.  I wish to note that on his resignation today.<\/p> <p>I welcome everyone back and ask the Leader if we might in early course have a debate on the dreadful humanitarian crisis arising from the migration of Syrian refugees towards the EU and into EU countries.  All of us have been shocked by the distressing images and reports of refugees on the borders of different EU countries.  I am glad of and welcome the Government's announcement that Ireland will play a strong part in welcoming Syrian refugees here under resettlement and relocation programmes, but I would like us to have a debate in the Seanad on this issue.  A number of us came together at a cross-party meeting on 10 September to discuss how Ireland can best respond.  There are different considerations around resettlement and relocation as well as practical and logistical issues which we should debate in this House while we see the process moving on with the Government's task force and the NGO consultations.  We should be as generous as possible towards people who are fleeing dreadful conflict in Syria.  <\/p> <p>I can inform colleagues that we considered the Fennelly commission report today at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  Mr. Justice Fennelly's interim report was produced on foot of a request by the committee for an interim report on a number of issues.  The committee will be writing to the Government seeking that the interim report and the full report, when it comes out, will be brought within its remit for discussion at the committee.  <\/p> <p>Finally, I welcome the signing into law of the Marriage Equality Bill and the fact that we will see in a very short time, I hope, the first gay marriages taking place in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Q00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I also echo the sentiments and best wishes to Senator Jimmy Harte on his retirement.<\/p> <p>They are sleeping in tents in Tallaght.

Reports this week are that 50 families a day are without emergency accommodation in south Dublin.  We have a shelterless crisis in Tallaght and throughout the nation and the land, and in a culture where we have this extraordinary seanfhocal which says that we live in each other's shelter and shadow.  There still is a little bit of that going on in Tallaght.  I experienced it last week.  Under the shelter of the oak, beech and chestnut trees alongside the parking lot of the priory in Tallaght village, not far from the famous Friar's Walk, a group of volunteers who call themselves VISIT set up tables, brought food and started to serve people who were shelterless and homeless that day.  They have been doing this four times a week over the past year and the numbers they serve are growing.  Ask them what they do when it rains or downpours.  They say they walk over to the covered entrance to the priory itself.  Why do these civicly minded, generous volunteers have to do this in the rain?  Why do they have to do it at all?

I wish him well.  He was very popular here and was so proud and delighted to be a Senator.  I know that from his contributions and meeting him.  It is sad that he has decided to resign for health reasons.  We wish him a speedy recovery.  I also extend best wishes to him, his wife Mary and family.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I served with his father, Paddy Harte, as a Deputy and I took over from Paddy in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1982.<\/p><p>When I met Jimmy I was struck by how proud he was of his connection with the FAI and the staff there, whom he brought into the House.  We were all delighted to be in the House but he was particularly delighted as he had worked very hard to get here, having previously been a councillor.  His father and mother were also here and they were very proud of him.  It is disappointing but we wish him every success.<\/p><p>The decision by Paddy Cosgrave's company to move the web summit from Dublin to Lisbon is a major disappointment.  I pay tribute to him and his team of 120 workers in bringing the summit here, which grew from a small number, 400 or 500, in 2010 to 30,000 last year.  The Government should explain why it allowed this marvellous event to leave this country.  It was a great contributor to Dublin and to Ireland, because what comes into Dublin also spreads, from a tax point of view, to people around the country.  As the former political head of Bord Tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la, now Enterprise Ireland, I believe the State should have its own, Irish web summit next year.  I do not see why we are depending on any individual company to arrange for seminars and functions in this country, which is the leading light in the world.  Mr. Cosgrave has no monopoly on seminars or summits.  I am sure that Bord F&aacute;ilte, Enterprise Ireland and other enterprising people would be prepared to get the leaders of Google and such organisations together to bring our own international summit to Ireland and to hold it, not just in Dublin but in Galway, Cork, Limerick and other parts of the country.<\/p><p>Let us be more proactive in this regard.  This country is Ireland Inc. and we are stronger than any Paddy Cosgrave company.  We can do it if we want to do it, with the will and the right leadership, which I hope will be forthcoming from the last dying sting of this particular wasp of a Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#R02500","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I wish my good friend and colleague, Jimmy Harte, all the best on his retirement.

There should be a debate in this House not only on this Bill but on rural life in general.  I welcome the announcement today of &euro;30 million for village and town renewals.  This will spearhead a recovery in rural Ireland where much of rural Ireland has been left behind.  The Criminal Justice Bill we are discussing deals with bail laws and people who commit crimes while on bail.  I have raised this in the House before and the situation has to be looked at.  People who received concurrent sentences knew that they faced a concurrent sentence, no matter how many crimes they committed.  It is important that consecutive sentences are included in this Bill.  We are the people who make the laws of this country but we are not the people who implement them.  That is the garda&iacute;.  I welcome the reopening of Templemore where 250 guards passed out this year, with 500 more this year.  I think the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Commissioner will make sure that these are allocated to rural Ireland to ensure rural crime will stop.  There has been hypocrisy from Fianna F&aacute;il on the closing of rural Garda stations.  A garda in a rural Garda station will not stop rural crime in the middle of the night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05000","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I have asked the Leader a question on rural crime and I will continue with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The Senator should be careful or Senator O'Donnell will have a go at him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>These people are highly organised and are coming in at night time, so it is important that sentencing is a deterrent, and that is the purpose of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The Senator is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#T05500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I want to finish.

However, we are experiencing what has been described by many organisations as a national emergency.  All of us, both in government and opposition, have been raising the issue of housing for years.  The problem is that the State has completely abdicated responsibility.  There is no social housing being built at all.  There is no increase in the supply.  Many middle-income families who would ordinarily buy a home cannot get a mortgage and are renting property.  They are competing with people who are in need of social housing and who cannot find private rental accommodation.<\/p><p>Everyone who helps people or holds a clinic deals every single day with people in housing need who cannot find landlords and who will sign up to any of the options, be it the housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme or the rent supplement scheme.  It is becoming a real crisis.  Homelessness, in terms of people sleeping on the streets, is a real problem and there is a crisis.  There is also a problem for people who are being forced to sleep in overcrowded and substandard accommodation because they cannot gain access to any of the options that exist.  The only option for them is the private rental sector.  The State is abdicating its responsibility.<\/p><p>I fully support the need to have a proper debate on this issue.  It is not just a question of a debate because people want solutions.  We have been talking about this repeatedly since Jonathan Corrie died only a couple of yards from Leinster House not so long ago.  There was a national outcry, yet precious little was done later.  We need to have a debate on this issue.

This is a significant amount of money in rural Ireland.  I come from an area where the Leader programme was held up as a model, not only for the rest of Ireland but for the rest of Europe.  The Leader programme has worked and continues to work because it has an input from the ground up, from communities upwards.  In my county, and I think the same is true of other Leader areas, there is a consultation process under way which has received very positive feedback from the general public to ensure the money is filtered down to where it will be most effective.  If this Government was really serious about rural regeneration why does it not reintroduce the CL&Aacute;R programme that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had when he was Minister?  Why does it not reintroduce the RAPID programme which helped inner cities and which had a real positive effective impact on communities?<\/p><p>Would the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development come into the House and explain how this &euro;30 million - this drop in the ocean, this public relations stunt in the dying days of this Government - is going to be spent that will have any impact or any effect whatsoever?  Why is more money not given over to local authorities for secondary roads?  Why is there no reintroduction of the local improvement schemes?  Why are all these schemes, which were done away with by this Government and which were having a very real impact on rural Ireland, now being shunted to one side?  We get a PR statement coming out during the National Ploughing Championships which makes it look well.  I think it is unacceptable.<\/p><p>I also take up Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell on what she said.  I say to the Senator that we are very serious about our politics.

Sadly, Jimmy will not stand for re-election but I wish him well on his retirement and I wish him a speedy recovery.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the matter of how business is conducted in government.  Every year during our budget we have the HSE calling for more and more money.  It is &euro;500 million short or &euro;400 million short.  The lack of interdepartmental joined-up thinking is one example of how we are wasting money.  I hope the Leader can bring this to the attention of both the Minister for Health and the Minister for the environment.  There is a lady in Castlerea in County Roscommon who has had a stroke.  She is in a unit in Galway and it is costing &euro;150,000 to keep her there with no end in sight.  She is also looking for a housing adaptation grant in order for her family to be able to take her home.  As she is over the limit she will not receive the grant she needs, which is only &euro;35,000.  If Departments talked to each other, one could say, \"Give that woman the &euro;35,000 to make her house adaptable and let us save on the &euro;150,000.\"  However, it does not happen, it is ridiculous.  It is no wonder that families are frustrated looking at these scenarios.<\/p> <p>I now turn to the proposed wind turbine set-back distances, leaks about which featured in yesterday&rsquo;s media.  Going from 500 m to 600 m is nothing short of tokenism.  Greater set-back distances are required.  We have a peculiar scenario where two Ministers in one party, my party, cannot agree on this.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, wants larger set-back distances but the Minister of State, Deputy White, is blocking it because he thinks we will not meet our 2020 targets.   We will reach our targets if other forms of renewable energy were explored instead of concentrating solely on onshore wind power.  The offshore wind power yield is ten times greater than onshore and it is not being done.

We in this Chamber should be aware that we are likely to face a huge increase in anti-refugee sentiment when in our country we have more than 2,000 people in emergency accommodation, homeless people on the streets and half of those homeless being children.  This morning we heard a Capuchin monk say he is feeding 800 people daily.  What is the Government going to do for the Irish people who are forced to rely on Christian charity just to eat?<\/p> <p>I have heard the Taoiseach say he wants to see recovery behind every door.  So do I, but what I find behind many doors is unresolved debt and  missing people due to emigration and, sadly, suicide in some cases.  The fact our people have been left in this situation does not bode well for the refugees we should rightfully accept into our country.  The Government cannot continue to treat our homeless people, those in direct provision for up to ten years and the refugees who come here as numbers on a page.  Throwing hundreds of refugees into Monasterevin is not a way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Y00100","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Y00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Will the Leader tell me what the Seanad will do this session in its dying months?

We think of him and his family at this difficult time and hope the future will be much brighter for him.<\/p> <p>This year will be remembered for the appalling situation we have witnessed in Syria and other war-torn parts of the world, with hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in Europe.  I am pleased a decision was finally taken yesterday that 160,000 refugees would be accommodated, housed and cared for in the European Union and that we would take our share of those, at least 4,000.  Will the Seanad bring forward whatever legislation or authorisation is required from the Houses of the Oireachtas next week to facilitate the Government in accommodating those people?

He was most unfortunate to have had the accident he had and I suppose there but for the grace of God go any of us.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of housing about which we heard a lot over the summer months.  Unfortunately, the words have not been matched by action in this area, which is regrettable.  The fact that, in the lifetime of this Government, we have allowed construction of housing, particularly in the public sector, to fall to the levels it has fallen is a very significant contributory factor to the crisis and the levels of homelessness we now see.  In 2013, 8,300 houses were built.  The figure increased slightly to 11,000 in 2014.  It needs to be done on an annual basis.  Having just come out of a recession caused by a property bubble, we are on the cusp of another one, particularly in the capital city, and very little action is being taken to address it.  <\/p> <p>I am calling for a number of things to be done.  The cost of houses must be controlled and I am looking for the restoration of the certificate of reasonable value, which applied a number of decades ago and which could have an effect in controlling house prices.  I am asking that mortgage interest relief, which was abolished by this Government in 2012, be restored at the marginal rate in order to assist those trying to get on the property ladder.  I would like to see action taken in respect of the scandal of high variable mortgage rates, which has been allowed to continue and about which we have heard a lot of talk by the Minister for Finance and other politicians.  I would like to see it tackled seriously to force the banks to bring them down to competitive rates.  The banks have never borrowed at more competitive rates.  <\/p> <p>If we are to tackle this issue, it must be met with a significant improvement in capital investment, which this Government again slashed in 2012, in local authority house construction.  That is the only solution and it must be effected in the budget.  If politicians and the Government are serious about it, we should see that reflected in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 13 October 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#Z00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>We are way over time and there are eight Senators left so we will take them tomorrow.

The question of housing was also raised by Senators Aideen Hayden, David Cullinane, Paul Coghlan and Jim Walsh.  Many Members complimented Threshold on its report and Senator Jim Walsh came up with some very good points.  However, it has to be pointed out that the Government of which his party was part abandoned the building of social housing during the boom, when the country was awash with money and it was wondering how it could spend it.  That is one area in which it could have spent it, but it did not do so.<\/p> <p>I presume Senator John Crown was looking for permission to publish his Bill.  In that case, I will agree to the amendment proposed to the Order of Business, that No. 15 be taken before No. 1.<\/p> <p>Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the regrettable choice of language used by a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor in describing as west Brits the people who ran Irish rugby.  It was a disgraceful comment.  As Senator Jim D'Arcy pointed out, the Irish rugby team is a 32-county team, an all-island team, and we wish it success in its ventures in the Rugby World Cup in the coming weeks.  Such comments are bigoted and we are adding credence to them in discussing them in the House.<\/p> <p>I note Senator Terry Leyden's comments about the Web Summit.  It is to be regretted that it is to be moved next year for the many reasons outlined.  They include the exorbitant prices charged by some hotels this year during the summit when they had a captive audience.  This is something we will obviously have to discuss at a later stage when we are debating tourism related matters.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is certainly vehemently opposed to the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  She is correct in what she said about Senator Jimmy Harte.  He is a man who always despised violence by the IRA.  I remember vividly his description of his family house which was attacked by it during the Troubles.  He is a man who has always advocated the reunification of the country by peaceful means and with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland, as his father advocated.  Many of the people who advocated it long before the Good Friday Agreement was signed were not taken seriously and frowned upon.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, it is a policy which Senator Jimmy Harte always advocated, as did his family before him.<\/p><p>Senator O'Neill spoke about rural crime and welcomed the publication of the new burglary and dwellings Bill and the announcement of &euro;30 million for village and town renewal.

He is right in that regard.  It is something Senator Mulcahy has raised on several occasions in debates on disability.  I am sure the Minister has received the message at this stage but I will certainly bring the matter to his attention.  Senator Barrett also recalled the deaths of several public service workers when on duty over the summer.  We express our sympathies to the families of those workers.<\/p><p>Senator Comiskey raised the replacement of the disadvantaged areas scheme by a new scheme and welcomed that and the moneys being provided for it.

I read an article by Dearbhail McDonald in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>last Sunday on her recollections of the Troubles and how they still affect her today.  She wrote: <\/p><blockquote>I can still remember the sounds of the first bomb I ever heard.  And to this day there are back roads at home that I can't drive alone after dark because of terrifying childhood recollections [...] I count myself blessed that my family and I were not among the 7,000 parents who lost their child, the 15,000 who lost a sibling or the 3,000 who lost a spouse [...]  The real tragedy, 21 years after the IRA ceasefire, and almost 18 years after the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement, is that the people of Northern Ireland are being held hostage.  They are being held hostage to Sinn F&eacute;in leader Gerry Adams' vainglorious plan to govern on both sides of the border by the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 2016.<\/blockquote> <p>This was an excellent piece by Dearbhail McDonald and it should be read by everybody.  I welcome the request by our Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, facilitate the return of the five main parties in Northern Ireland to the round table talks, which resumed yesterday.  The talks will hopefully advance the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and address the trust and confidence issues arising from the impact and legacy of paramilitary activity.  <\/p><p>Getting to this stage has been very difficult.  I know that every effort is being made to ensure a successful outcome to the talks.  I think all parties involved are optimistic that with committed, collective engagement the two Governments and all the parties can make real progress on both the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and tackling the legacy of paramilitarism.  Last Friday, the Secretary of State announced a British Government assessment of the current profile of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  Yesterday, the British Government announced the three members of an independent panel set up to assess paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.  The British Government assessment is separate from the request of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to the Garda Commissioner to continue to liaise closely with the PSNI in respect of its investigation into the murder of Kevin McGuigan and to let her have a fresh assessment in light of any evidence emerging from that investigation.<\/p><p>The issue of criminality stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism is also an important point for the talks.  I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement that there will be enhanced support and resources for tackling criminality in Northern Ireland.  This is very much in keeping with the Government's strong determination to tackle crime and I look forward to the outcome of the conference on organised crime that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, will host in County Sligo.  We have had debates from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on criminality, on diesel laundering and all the other activities that are going on in the Border area.  Many people feel that a blind eye has been turned, by the British authorities in particular, to that area.  I always believe in following the money.  The money must be followed because one can see the lifestyle of many of the people who are involved in this activity, the type of houses they have and so on.  One wonders where the money and the proceeds of these crimes are.  It is very easy for Sinn F&eacute;in to say - though I laud them for saying it - that people should bring any evidence of criminality to the PSNI but when there is a system in which some communities in Northern Ireland are terrified to give information for fear of what happened to Robert McCartney, Paul Quinn and others-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#GG01100","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Give the information to the PSNI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#GG01200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Senator Cummins without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#GG01300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>There is a fear and this has been highlighted in many areas.

These policies and thoughts - which were not a very popular thing to say in the 1970s and the 1980s - were also advocated by his father and many people of that time, way before the Good Friday Agreement.  I am glad that people have now come around, with the Good Friday Agreement, to those ideas.  There has been too much procrastination on these issues but they need to be solved and now is the time to act.  It is hoped that the ongoing talks will bring continued peace in the country.

I welcome the Minister.  I would have liked to have heard what the Minister said since I know he is directly involved in the process.  I believe the Minister has struck a tone, which we all need to have during times of crisis and at this juncture also.<\/p> <p>I have recently watched documentaries relating to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  The commentaries of the documentaries include the point that there was a time during the Troubles when it was felt that peace would never be achieved in Northern Ireland.  During the time when efforts were being made to solve what seemed like an impossible position - because of the underlying history, politics and partisanship - President Mary McAleese said that no matter how difficult the task was it was a prize worth fighting for.<\/p> <p>If we remember Martin McGuinness and the late Dr. Ian Paisley going about their duties within the new structures the message that came from that personal relationship absolutely surprised many people at the time.  In a lot of ways it gave us back a faith in human nature - that we can all respect each other while at the same time not necessarily changing our narrative just to be patronising towards somebody else.  They proved that it could be done.  As they travelled through the world, and particularly in the United States of America which had played a direct role in the evolution of the peace process with President Clinton's hands-on involvement, they saw democracy and diplomacy working for the good of all the people, while having different positions historically.<\/p> <p>We should not be surprised that developments as good as the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and the exceptional structures which are in place would not have some hiccups and glitches.  It is said that this crisis is bigger than anything we have had since the Agreement was brought into being and the structures were put in place.  However, when one looks at Irish history post 1916, post the War of Independence of the 1920s, and post Civil War, on each occasion there was residue left which had to be attended to.  Terrible atrocities were committed in those years and yet people realised that peace is the starting point for any quality of life.  People yearn for peace.<\/p> <p>When Derry hosted the 2013 Fleadh Ceoil, 430,000 people turned up.  I recall walking down the streets and people who may have known my connection with the fleadh stopping and saying to me how grateful they were that they could feel and sense normality even for one week.  The sentiment was echoed by Nell McCafferty on radio.  She said it was the first time in over 30 years there was a smile on the face of the people of Derry.  That is the prize we talk about. <\/p> <p>We did take our eye off the ball.  I would have preferred to see Northern Ireland debated in this House more often, but the feeling seems to be that once the structures were put in place then that was the end of the Republic&rsquo;s involvement.  However, we are the co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and we should be having a debate, not about the issues that divide us but about the issues which unite us.  There are many opportunities, some of which we see in cross-Border co-operation.  An Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister should meet to discuss issues because the Agreement needs to be tied down and copper-fastened.  A meeting between David Cameron and An Taoiseach at this time could be helpful.  This would not take from Minister Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s status or involvement, I know he will do a good job.  Against a background of good relationships, which includes the visits by the Queen and Prince Charles, we are in a different position now than we ever were before.<\/p> <p>It is worrying that given the atmosphere of elections in which we now find ourselves, the main thrust and focus of what we should be doing could easily get lost during electioneering in the North and South.  It may be unintentional but we should be cautious to protect what has been achieved by so many people who have invested in the process.  In a crisis we need to remind ourselves of Martin McGuinness and Dr. Paisley and the manner in which they worked together.  From my own limited knowledge of Northern Ireland I know that the average person wants this crisis resolved.  People want to return to real politics and they want democracy to be supreme.  If other issues need to be dealt with then there is the police force to deal with those.   The Republic&rsquo;s tone going forward should be to cultivate, save and enhance the peace process and to develop closer relationships North and South.  Above all else we should not lose the great progress which has been made in the relationship between Ireland and Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#HH01100","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.

I concur with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; when he says that perhaps this is an issue that might be the subject of more frequent debate.  I assure the Senator and the House that any time the Seanad wishes to debate this issue, as long as I am Minister for Foreign Affairs, I will be anxious to oblige and be present.  I remarked to myself at the Ploughing Championships yesterday that two years ago the political narrative was about the future of the Seanad and whether it would remain in place.  I have been pleased to seek to accommodate the House on all occasions that I have been invited to address it during the past 14 months.<\/p><p>I welcome this debate and I thank the proposer, Senator Cummins, and the House for the opportunity to outline the position of the Government on the current political situation in Northern Ireland.  I speak to the House following the resumption, on Monday, 21 September, of round-table talks involving the five main parties in Northern Ireland.  Those talks remain ongoing.  Getting to this point has not been easy.  The past few weeks have been difficult and challenging.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and I worked closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, meeting bilaterally and trilaterally with the parties, in an effort to ensure that everybody was not only around the table but around the table at the same time.  I am pleased that we achieved this and I am hopeful that the collective and committed engagement will lead to a successful outcome to the talks.  However, by no means do I underestimate the challenge that lies ahead.  A collapse of the institutions in Northern Ireland remains a real possibility and, therefore, it is incumbent on all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two Governments, to seize what is a narrow window of opportunity and work hard to achieve what can be a positive outcome.  A positive outcome is not only essential for politics in Northern Ireland but, first and foremost, for its people, who really deserve a functioning government.  <\/p><p>My focus will continue to be on facilitating constructive talks and ensuring I do all I can to see to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, particularly in the context of the various institutions.  I will also seek to ensure that the agreement and subsequent agreements are respected and protected.  The key objective now is to make progress in intensive, focused negotiation on the key issues that the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron set out, namely, the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and tackling the legacy of paramilitarism.  The parties have already begun to address these issues in the resumed sessions of the talks that began last Monday.  These opening exchanges were somewhat general in nature but I am under no illusion about the hard work that will be required in the detailed sessions scheduled for this week and next.  It is my assessment that all of the parties were broadly constructive in the discussions which took place on Monday in seeking to outline what they see as the direction of travel towards resolving these difficult and challenging issues.<\/p><p>The issue of the impact legacy of paramilitarism and associated organised crime and criminality are clearly concerns that must be addressed in a robust way if these talks are to be successful.  The aim must be to create the circumstances where, in the not-too-distant future, we have a generation in Northern Ireland that has not known sectarianism or the vestigial shadow of paramilitarism.  In order to facilitate the resumption of round-table talks, the Secretary of State announced on Friday, 18 September, a British Government assessment of the current profile of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  This is a once-off assessment which will be completed in the coming weeks.  It does not pre-empt the discussion on the paramilitary issues in the talks.  I expect that this assessment group, made up of Lord Carlile, Rosalie Flanagan and Stephen Shaw, QC, will report in a few weeks.  I have made clear in my remarks, and I wish to bolster it here this evening in the Seanad, that the issue in the talks on the matter of paramilitarism cannot be delayed until the outcome of this British Government assessment is known.  While the assessment may be of assistance to the Northern Ireland parties as they consider how best to tackle the impact and legacy of paramilitarism, it does not replace the need to begin focused work on how the continuing shadow of paramilitarism over communities in Northern Ireland can be eradicated for ever.<\/p><p>The work on tackling the legacy of paramilitarism may involve several aspects.  It may, for example, include some form of future monitoring arrangement, perhaps modelled on the former Independent Monitoring Commission.  There is a crucial need to set out a vision for a Northern Ireland beyond the shadow of paramilitary activity and its associated criminality and a plan for how to best realise it.  This is one major focus of the talks.  The Irish Government, together with its British counterpart, will actively contribute to finding a way forward on these issues but, ultimately, it is essential that the parties agree a shared vision and a common plan to move society in Northern Ireland to full normalisation.  I add, for the sake of clarity, that the British Government assessment is a separate matter from the request made by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, to the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda focus is on the circumstances in this jurisdiction.  The Garda authorities work very closely with their counterparts in the PSNI on an ongoing basis in respect of the security threat and across the range of other policing challenges facing the two services in our respective jurisdictions.<\/p><p>In light of recent developments with regard to the murder of Kevin McGuigan, the Minister for Justice and Equality asked the Garda Commissioner to maintain that liaison with the PSNI in respect of its investigation and to give her a fresh assessment in light of any evidence emerging from the investigation.  It is essential that the PSNI be allowed to carry on its investigation into the murder of Mr. McGuigan without fear or favour.  That investigation is a matter of evidence and solely a matter of evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#HH01300","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>It is up to the PSNI to follow the evidence.

I welcome the recent announcement of the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, that there will be enhanced support and resources to tackle the scourge of criminality in Northern Ireland.

Next week the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford, will host a conference on organised crime in Sligo, which will be attended by representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the customs services and the asset recovery agencies.  Organised crime, whatever its nature and whoever is carrying it out, inflicts great damage on our communities and there continues to be a shared determination to tackle it effectively.  I am pleased that the talks in Northern Ireland have enabled us to highlight the solid work we are doing to combat this scourge on society and to refocus on the indispensable need for North-South co-operation in this area.  I welcome the contribution of Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; in the debate in the past and, in particular, in recent months.  Many Senators are actively involved in other fora of the British-Irish parliamentary tier.<\/p><p>Of equal importance in the talks is the need to fully implement the Stormont House Agreement.  This agreement, concluded on 23 December 2014, offers a blueprint to overcoming current difficulties in the Northern Ireland Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.  While financing and welfare reform is an internal issue for Northern Ireland, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their difference for the sake of Northern Ireland's economic stability and the sustainability of public services throughout Northern Ireland.  That is not only vitally important for the people of Northern Ireland but also for developing and creating an all-island economy which benefits all citizens.<\/p><p>It is also crucial that we complete the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on setting up institutions to deal with the legacy of the past so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families, friends and communities.  My officials and I are working intensively with the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Office to ensure the rapid establishment of the institutions, including the independent commission for information retrieval, the historical investigations unit and the implementation and reconciliation group.  An international treaty between the British and Irish Governments is required in order to set up the independent commission for information retrieval.  Throughout these negotiations, which are well under way, the Government has focused on the need to underpin the independence of the commission and to put the families of the victims and survivors at the centre of everything the commission will do.<\/p><p>When it comes to the historical investigations unit, I have repeated Ireland's strong commitment, as set out in the Stormont House Agreement, to ensure that Irish authorities co-operate fully with the historical investigations unit.  That will require legislation within this jurisdiction, which will be brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality in the coming months.<\/p><p>I wish to clarify one point.  Some media coverage in the past week has suggested that the institutions for dealing with the past agreed at Stormont House would somehow convey an amnesty.  That is not true.  There will be no amnesty.  The new institutions, as agreed, provide for different ways of dealing with the past.  The new historical investigations unit provides for police investigation and, where there is an evidential basis, the prospect of justice.<\/p><p>The independent commission for information retrieval, to be established by the two Governments, is intended to allow individuals to seek information about Troubles-related deaths where there is no realistic prospect of prosecution; and information provided to the commission for this purpose would not be admissible in a court of law.  However, the Stormont House Agreement makes it clear that no individual who provides information to this body will be immune from prosecution for any crime committed should the required evidential test be satisfied by other means and this will be reflected in the agreement establishing the body.  In addition, an oral history archive will be established.  These bodies will be overseen by an implementation and reconciliation group, with a mandate to promote reconciliation, a better understanding of the past and to reduce sectarianism.  I believe that taken together, those four mechanisms provide an opportunity to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in a way which upholds the rule of law and facilitates justice, acknowledges and addresses the needs of victims and survivors, is human rights compliant and, above all, promotes reconciliation.<\/p><p>Recent weeks have demonstrated once again that the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 was by no means the end of the journey but it was a seismic moment when we forged a new shared path for how we would address the different aspirations and identities on this island.  It requires constant care and attention and my focus in the course of the coming weeks will be to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement can be fully implemented and all its institutions can operate effectively.<\/p><p>I assure Senators, especially an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, of the involvement of the Taoiseach.  He is directly involved.  In the past ten days he has spoken to Prime Minister Cameron.  I talk to the Taoiseach almost daily about what is happening in Northern Ireland.  For the benefit of Members of this House, hardly a talks session concludes without me receiving a call from the Taoiseach, who is updated on a daily basis and whose involvement can only be described as engaged fully and directly involved.<\/p><p>An Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to electioneering.  There is no election here.  That matter was referred to in the Lower House yesterday.  There is no election on here and if there were, Senators would be busily engaged in their own pursuits.  Senators can be assured that nothing that has been said on the matter of Northern Ireland will in any way be referenced or related to any other campaign anywhere.<\/p><p>I am not sure how much more time I have but I am almost ready to conclude.  A key component of the Good Friday Agreement remains North-South co-operation.  It is important that this co-operation is allowed to continue, despite the difficult political situation in Stormont.  North-South co-operation is vitally important not just for police co-operation but also in the areas of tourism, transport and trade.  I know several Members of this House also have direct experience of the useful co-operation that takes place in the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.<\/p><p>I have spoken in recent weeks to the leadership of all the Executive parties.  I have heard very clearly the frustration they all feel.  But underneath that, I have discerned a deep and steely resolve to ensure that the power-sharing institutions are preserved and maintained.  Every party is up for talks because, whether they articulate it or not, every party knows what is at stake: the very survival of the power-sharing institutions themselves.  There is undoubtedly a realisation that the consequences of failure would constitute a serious set-back for the people of Northern Ireland and the people of our island.<\/p><p>If, despite our best efforts, the institutions fall, then under the legislation elections would immediately follow.  Regrettably, such early elections would take place in a divisive context and the issues of contention would remain to be resolved in their aftermath.  While everybody welcomes elections and at all times the people are sovereign and will cast their vote on the issues of the day, elections in Northern Ireland would not immediately resolve the problems because issues relating to finance, welfare, the Stormont House Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement will still remain and need to be resolved in the aftermath of any fresh elections.  It is, therefore, far better to resolve the outstanding issues now.  All the parties, with the support of the two Governments, must seize the current opportunity, engage constructively and in a spirit of mutual respect and seek to resolve the current difficulties for the benefit of the people they represent.  Of course, it is right that this House should debate the matter of Northern Ireland at every opportunity.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the decision earlier today of a Member of this House to announce his retirement, namely, a colleague of mine, Senator Jimmy Harte.  I have had a close association with the Harte family for many years.  I concur with the Leader of the House who acknowledged the very important role played by Senator Jimmy Harte, the Harte family and, in particular, the former Deputy, Paddy Harte, on matters not only relating to Donegal and Northern Ireland but nationally.  Paddy Harte was one of the few politicians who took risks for peace.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was, no doubt, acknowledged in the context of the historic coming together of parties to sign the Good Friday Agreement.

Therefore, all of us have an obligation to go forward in a spirit of positivity, knowing that both compromises and courage will be required from all the participants involved, because it will not work otherwise.  In conclusion, I know I can count on the support of all in this House as we seek to bring the current talks to a successful conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#JJ00500","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending and for his efforts in the talks, including his presence at Stormont, which we see on television repeatedly.  His role is most valuable.  In the life of this Seanad, we were so busy dealing with the near bankruptcy of the State, the bailout and so on that we may have lacked time to talk to our neighbours in Northern Ireland, but that has certainly been remedied, which is most important.  Given the 3,600 deaths and 40,000 injuries, we cannot go back.  The &quot;house on the hill&quot;, as the biography of Stormont calls it, should be retained and made to work, and decommissioning should be made to work.  We in this jurisdiction have a major interest in ensuring there is peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I have the honour to represent constituents in that area because so many of them are graduates of Trinity College, Dublin.  When one crosses the Border in the west, one sees Portora.  Samuel Beckett, Henry Francis Lyte and Oscar Wilde are three people who went from there to study just down the road from Leinster House.  On the other side were Hamilton Harty in Hillsborough and Brian Maginess, a liberal who was interested in the Orange parades issue back in the 1950s.  We have these connections.  I regret that about four times as many Northerners come South than Southerners go North.  We need to develop the North South Inter-Parliamentary Association, as the Minister said.  I would like to see lots of Northern visitors here to talk to people, on a drop-in basis almost, because we are all on the one side of this.<\/p><p>I was with our graduates recently at Fort Dunree in Donegal.  It was the last fort to be handed over in 1938, when the Union Jack was taken down and the Tricolour put up.  In fact, the two officers, the one leaving and the other taking over, were brothers-in-law who had both married people who lived in the locality.  That was the last piece of territory to be handed over by Britain to the Republic as part of the treaty port issue in 1938.<\/p><p>We have so many connections.  Speakers mentioned the all-Ireland sports teams in rugby, cricket and hockey, and we all gain from that.  If it is necessary to find an anthem like &quot;Ireland's Call&quot; that can be sung happily by people of both traditions in this country, I would think that excellent.<\/p><p>I wish Rosalie Flanagan, Stephen Shaw and Lord Carlile every success in their decommissioning exercise.  I commend them for taking up that responsibility in the tradition of Bill Clinton, Reverend Harold Good, General de Chastelain, Tony Blair and all those who have helped us to get so much advancement on the island.  We are indebted to those people.<\/p><p>When we were attempting a similar exercise here on the very first day of the Seanad, Arthur Griffith in particular was influential in nominating a large number of former Unionists.  William Butler Yeats said he came here not as a Nationalist, not as an Unionist, but as a Member of the Seanad.  As has been said earlier, the Reverend Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness had that momentum going.  We have to make sure we do not lose it.<\/p><p>There are concerns about the murders that have been mentioned of Mr. Quinn, Mr. McGuigan, Mr. Davison and Garda Adrian Donohoe.  The Smithwick report is terrifying to read in regard to what happened in south Armagh and north Louth on the day officers Buchanan and Breen were killed.  There was a paramilitary takeover of a large part of territory from 9 a.m. until those murders took place.  We have to get those residual issues sorted out.<\/p><p>Declan Kearney launched a most interesting book last week, with Derek Chilcott, the ambassador, and Dr. Heather Morris, the former president of the Methodist Church in Ireland.  In the book, <i>Uncomfortable Conversations<\/i>, Reverend Earl Storey writes:<\/p><blockquote>What is this peace process about?  Is it about breaking down a historic cycle of division, hatred and violence?  Or is it little more than a breathing space until the next round of fighting?<\/blockquote> <p>We want what Earl Storey wishes to be realised.  In the same volume,  Lord Alderdice writes that we have two identities not yet reconciled, despite all of the great efforts that have been made.  He states that there is a Protestant-Unionist-Loyalist identity which involves &quot;a sense of dominance - a disposition to think and act as though they ought to still be in charge&quot;.  Of the Catholic-Nationalist-Republican community, Lord Alderdice writes, &quot;Despite there now being parity of esteem and political, legal, social and economic opportunities, many people in [that] community still operate as though they were victims rather than the authors of our shared destiny.&quot;  It is this analysis of &quot;anxious dominance&quot; and &quot;victimhood&quot; that he feels holds the clue to what Declan Kearney calls &quot;uncomfortable conversations&quot;.<\/p><p>I admired the Taoiseach, at the weekend commemoration of Thomas Kent, when he mentioned the RIC man, William Rowe, who was a victim in that incident.  On Saturday, Trinity College will unveil a memorial to the people of 1914 to 1918.  That is coming together in places as far apart as Kerry and Donegal.  Ireland is discovering its shared identity.  I would hope to see that the prosperity that will follow from peace will benefit Northern Ireland, which is one of the lowest income regions in the United Kingdom.  It does not help in this era of high-tech and human capital industries that we have these disputes about flags, demonstrations and so on.  A new Northern Ireland will enhance its present position within these islands.<\/p><p>It is very important for all of us that the work of the Minister, the Secretary of State, Prime Minister Cameron and the Taoiseach succeeds because we cannot go back to the situation where so many people were killed and maimed, as Dearbhail McDonald has pointed out in her works.  I wish the Minister God speed and a fair wind in his task, which will benefit everyone on the island.  There are no enemies because we are all friends on this.  May the Minister succeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#LL00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the Government position on the current political situation in Northern Ireland.

I am delighted to see him here in the House.<\/p> <p>It is great that we have the opportunity for this discussion.  Particularly in recent weeks, developments have been unfolding by the hour and in every news bulletin we listen to, with allegations and new and fresh information coming forward.  In that sense, I hope we did not pre-empt the situation by having the debate today.  I would ask that, as events unfold over the coming weeks, this might be something we can return to in the very near future.<\/p> <p>In the past month alone, there have been discussions, breakdowns in discussions, breakdowns in communication, arrests and releases without charge.  We had the First Minister standing aside and Ministers resigning their posts, and we see a situation where, other than Arlene Foster, there are currently no Unionist Ministers serving on the Executive.

We need to move forward as no one wants to go back to what we had.  Senator Maurice Cummins spoke about Dearbhail McDonald&rsquo;s recent article in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  Living in Dundalk, I, too, remember the ordeal of travelling across the Border, as anyone from a Border town will know.  As a child, I was absolutely terrified of British soldiers, guns and the fortresses we sometimes had to go through.  One horrific day, I saw, as a child, the attempted shooting of a British soldier in Newry.  It has remained with me.  I can only imagine the horror people living in these circumstances experienced, as Dearbhail McDonald said, and the effect it had on them.<br\/><br\/>It is welcome that tomorrow the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will meet families dealing with legacy issues.  It would be great if we had the Narrow Water bridge project to cement North-South co-operation, both physically and politically.  There have been robust discussions about this project, both at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the North\/South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  It is awful that such good projects are marred by planning and costing decisions.  We could do much more to move it forward.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the announcement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that there will be enhanced support and resources to tackle criminality in Northern Ireland.  Fuel smuggling is epidemic across Border areas, a matter of which my colleague and fellow member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, Senator Paul Coghlan, has conducted an in-depth study and which I am sure he will address this evening.  Louth County Council has borne the brunt of the inordinate costs of clearing up the diesel sludge left behind by these criminals.  We need to tackle and address this question honestly.  As Senator Maurice Cummins said, we need honesty on both sides.<br\/><br\/>During the summer I listened to an emotional address by Paul Quinn&rsquo;s mother on radio, a mother gutted by the loss of her son but vehement in her view that the IRA is still in existence and controlling areas along the Border.  She is also vehement in her view that the IRA was responsible for the death of her young son, who was brutally beaten to death in County Monaghan.  She claims people living in Border areas are well aware of the situation, a point backed up by so many people who live along the Border.  I travelled between Dundalk and Monaghan for 16 years passing through Cullaville every day.  It was well known as an IRA stronghold.  One could not drive through it sometimes because of threats or bomb scares.  People who claim they have no idea of this need to come forward.<br\/><br\/>Another person to whom I spoke recently was Paudie McGahon, who came forward in the past few months as the victim of abuse by a Republican member in his own home.  He is adamant that the Sinn F&eacute;in leader was well aware of the abuse in 2002.  Unfortunately, the Sinn F&eacute;in leader denies this, just as he denied any knowledge of the horrific abuse of Ma&iacute;ria Cahill and failed to report his brother for abuse while allowing him to work with young children in Dundalk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#LL00300","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The Senator has gone way over time.

Speaking as director of the Abbey Theatre, I spend much time working with playwrights of both traditions and both sides of the divide, although artists and playwrights are uncomfortable with the word &ldquo;divide&rdquo;.  Consistently in the past year and a half we have produced much work by Northern writers such as Owen McCafferty, Jimmy McAleavey, Stacey Gregg and David Ireland.  These four writers come from different parts of the community, some from east Belfast, some from Dundonald - the Ballybeen estate, a loyalist estate - and others from a more middle class Catholic background.<\/p> <p>Without wishing to sound too vague about it, I consider many artists to be prophets.  Seamus Heaney was a prophet.  They somehow relate issues, concerns and themes ahead of politicians and the establishment.  They relate to the community from where they are writing.  That community can often be ahead of the establishment.  A play we did this year at the Abbey, &ldquo;Monsters, Dinosaurs, Ghosts&rdquo;, looked at the notion and prevalence of criminality in the North.  We cannot deal with criminality in the North in an ambiguous way; we have to be clear about it.  The signals we are getting from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade are that we cannot stand by, ignore or have an ambivalent view on both sides.  My sense from the loyalist community is that there is strong, almost nasty, criminality which is extraordinarily divisive among communities, particularly disaffected and disenfranchised young people.  I am hearing about this when it is not necessarily bubbling up to the core of the political sphere.  Some politicians in the five main parties are taking leadership.  However, I consider what Mike Nesbitt is doing as bouncing Mr. Peter Robinson into a scenario for short-term political gain.  I find this disturbing and regrettable.<\/p> <p>Of all the challenges in the peace process and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the one that has not been mentioned today is the continuing institutionalisation of sectarianism in the North.  More peace walls - I use the Orwellian term - have been built, dividing communities in the process, since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  There is very little of a coherent approach, both North and South, in acknowledging this.  I am in the middle of rehearsals for a play, &ldquo;Shibboleth&rdquo;, by Stacey Gregg from Dundonald, which looks at interface barriers, where communities are being divided for good, not because of culture or political persuasion but because of a physical barrier between communities.  I regret that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan did not raise this, but it is prevalent and insidious.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiach Mac Conghail:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2386\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2386&amp;amp;pid=FiachMacConghail&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we consider this extraordinary and very delicate political situation, the five main parties are not leading their communities.  Some of the disenfranchised and socially and economically deprived on both sides are being left behind.<\/p><p>Of course, when issues of flags, marches, parades and civil rights arise, they are exacerbated by the fact that the other side, whatever that means, is not seen any more because of these barriers, the so-called peace walls.  That is something I find very disturbing.  We talk about the wall around the West Bank, the Berlin Wall and other walls in other parts of the world, yet 100 miles up the road we are watching the institutionalisation of sectarianism.  Young people, in particular, find it increasingly difficult.  No matter what we do in terms of cross-community work and work bringing communities south to engage themselves, the physical barriers - they are no longer psychological barriers - the shibboleths that are occurring in Belfast city, are a matter of concern to me.  I listen to the playwrights of today, young people such as Stacey Gregg, who is approximately 30 years of age and is from a Protestant community.  She is saying that this is something we should mark and bear witness to, and that we should try to bring those walls down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#MM00900","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I have already seconded the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and appreciate very much the valuable work he has done in the past as co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and the work he is doing in his current position.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for the contribution he made earlier in the debate.  I acknowledge the work of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Villiers, MP.  I am delighted that the status of the IRA and other paramilitaries is being assessed.  I welcome the establishment of the three-person commission and the appointments of Lord Carlile, Ms Rosalie Flanagan and Mr. Stephen Shaw, QC.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, stated that the factual assessment should be in our hands in approximately one month's time.  I very much welcome that progress.<\/p> <p>Reference was made to the work in which the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has been involved.  Last February, that body was unanimous in respect of the establishment of a task force.  I acknowledge the work of Senator Walsh on that matter; he was a member of the same group as myself.  From what we found, the police North and South will never defeat these crime overlords.  These are people who have been engaged in smuggling perhaps all their lives.  If we leave this matter to the police, it will not be dealt with.  I mean no disrespect whatsoever and co-operation North and South between the police forces has never been better.  We believe that because the criminals are full-time professionals, a task force comprising the police, customs, Revenue, the Criminal Assets Bureau and its Northern equivalent and the environmental protection agencies - with all of these bodies working together on a full-time, professional basis - is required.  I am encouraged in that regard by the briefing we received from the Department.  In the context of cross-Border crime, there is already very strong North-South co-operation involving the police and other relevant agencies from the two jurisdictions.  Ways to further enhance this excellent work will be examined.  I hope that the task force will not be eliminated and that, perhaps, it may yet be brought into being.<\/p> <p>While there are difficulties in north Louth - a matter to which Senator Moran referred - there are greater difficulties in south Armagh.  There is no normal policing in south Armagh and there probably will not be for years.  The level of policing is so light, I would say the police presence there is but a token.  Officers are largely confined to barracks.  The station in Crossmaglen is a fortress-like, bomb-proof building.  Senator Walsh and I saw it and we could not find a door in the metal sheeting.  Eventually, some fellow spotted us on camera and came out and brought us in.  I mean no disrespect but policing standards, despite best efforts, are not normal there.  Policing levels in south Armagh do not equate to those which obtain in the rest of the North.  In a so-called democratic society, I do not think that is right.<\/p> <p>I also thought it was very abnormal that the area is littered with these blue, unofficial, community alert notices.  There is a number people can ring and it is not the police.  I do not know who it is but the locals believe the notices are erected by the provisional IRA.  They believe it still exists on the ground there.  The people who are engaged in the criminality, we just refer to them as the crime overlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#NN00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>They are very silly to leave their mobile numbers there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#NN00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Coghlan, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#NN00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>They did not leave their mobiles.

In a democratic society, this is not normal or right.  Although we are not party to Schengen, there are international arrangements and so on.  We need a North-South corridor along the Border where the Garda and police districts in the North could co-operate.  We should allow a kind of joint authority where they can criss-cross the Border and investigate crime.  They co-operate excellently, by the way.

I welcome the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who has left.  In fairness, he has significantly strengthened the commitment from the Government's side on this topic.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, a light touch has been applied in recent years and this has perhaps created the void.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, might say we are 17 years into the peace process and it is really time for the politicians in the North to be taking responsibility and showing leadership themselves.  That has not been happening, although I acknowledge that Mr. Martin McGuinness, in particular, has been a very good appointment as Deputy First Minister.  From talking to MLAs on the Unionist side, I think they would also feel he is someone with whom they can do business.  Of course, this whole issue leads to a lack of credibility and trust, which is very much in evidence there.<\/p> <p>I will start where my colleague finished.  Through our work in south Armagh, it was very apparent that there is a high level of criminality there.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is intimidation and a spirit of <i>omerta<\/i>and it is obvious that former IRA combatants are involved.  These people can be named and have been named privately to us.  It is also clear as one travels around that they are doing very well financially from their exercise.  When we were there and talking to locals, what worried me is that it operated as it did in the past, namely, that the money raised was &quot;for the cause&quot;.  That begs the question - what cause are we talking about now?  Is it now a political cause?  Therein lies a threat that could skew our political and democratic processes here.<br\/><br\/>This organised crime must be tackled seriously.  In that regard, I must say that I am not totally impressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Justice Minister, David Ford MLA, hosting a conference on organised crime.  A task force that is committed to dealing with it is required.  More worryingly, when the Garda Commissioner signalled that the IRA is no longer in existence back in February, one wondered how out of touch she was regarding what was going on.  If there is no awareness among the authorities upon which the State depends to keep law and order, there is no hope of correcting or controlling it.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said, &quot;it is also crucial that we complete the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families&quot;.  I will believe it when I see it.  It is wishful thinking.  We have tried through these Houses for many years to get the British to give some semblance of co-operation with regard to the perpetrators and information they have regarding the largest atrocity during the Troubles, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and in particular, the high level of collusion involving British forces and possibly British politicians in those atrocities.  The former Taoiseach made strenuous efforts with his counterpart at the time, Tony Blair, and was told that MI5 would not co-operate in releasing the information.  How convenient.  Governments are elected to govern and, unfortunately, we have not seen any of that.  <br\/><br\/>I caution the Minister whose bona fides in this area I do not doubt as I think he is highly committed to it.  He comes with a lot of knowledge and expertise in the area.  He talks about how an international treaty between the British and Irish Governments is required for the establishment of the independent commission for information retrieval.  Is this the same British Government that a previous Irish Government entered into an international agreement with?  Judge Peter Corry was appointed to look at certain murders and atrocities that happened both North and South.  This was subsequently reneged upon when Judge Corry looked for a public inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane.  This was done because there were very high levels of collusion involved.  <br\/><br\/>Understandably but regrettably, party politics are interfering with progressing the normalisation of politics and society in the North.  What Mike Nesbitt, MLA, and the UUP did in removing David Kennedy from the Executive was obviously done for his own narrow party political interest.  The same happened with Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP.  Clearly Sinn F&eacute;in is in a bind in that it is looking at politics down here and trying to co-ordinate what it does in the North in respect of whether it will be popular down here.  One cannot run an administration based on that.  <br\/><br\/>A number of the murders that were committed have been mentioned.  I can understand that the murder of &quot;Jock&quot; Davison on 5 May would have resonated with a lot of republicans.  He was highly regarded with the republican community.  He was a man who played his part when the loyalist murder gangs were assassinating innocent Catholics in the North and gained quite a degree of respect for that.  I know there are allegations about him being involved in the murder of Robert McCartney.  We have a situation where we have, more or less, a total abandonment of law and order and this must change.  The killing of Paul Quinn and the murder of Robert McCartney were never thoroughly investigated to bring the perpetrators to justice.  Their families must get restitution by way of the truth and the prosecution of those responsible.<br\/><br\/>We need to cleanse the process of all criminality, be it the IRA or the loyalist paramilitaries who are also up to the necks in it.  All of this must be cleansed.  We must build trust and respect and make politics work.  This effort must not just partially deal with it.  It must deal with it so that we can turn over a new chapter and there can be a progression of the real needs of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#NN01100","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for having this debate today.  We all acknowledge that the struggles faced by the people of Northern Ireland during the Troubles were a real injustice.  It was forced on them by the divisions of history and the low bar set by that history for how neighbour should treat neighbour.  The way people in the North were treated by paramilitaries during those years must be condemned.  The cruel realities of those days are a stain on the histories of these islands and it has long been clear that peace was not only the will of the people but the responsibility of their leaders and the leaders of parties to build and sustain.  We must all recognise this, particularly the parties in the North.  I compliment the Minister on the role he has played since he took office in ensuring this is done.  Recognising the genuine grievances of both sides - and I stress both sides - a peace was painstakingly built on imperfect foundations.  This peace was rightly held up as a model for the world of what can be achieved when people of good will and strong character reach across divisions in the name of something greater.  From the pragmatic and cautious hope of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 to the celebration of the St Andrew's Agreement in 2006, this House has long applauded the inspiring progress made in the North and South.  I acknowledge all people in the current Government and previous Governments who took part in that.  I also acknowledge Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness who were regarded as the &quot;Chuckle Brothers&quot;.<\/p><p>However, we now face a serious impasse.  The hard-won stability of the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland is uncertain and it can feel like we have moved backwards in the saga of peace in Northern Ireland.  Two things need to be made very clear here.  The rule of law is the foundation of any viable state.  No crime should stand above or outside that rule of law.  No citizen, group of citizens or citizens linked to any party should stand above or outside that rule of law.  An imperfect foundation was necessary for the peace process in Northern Ireland - an understanding that the priority was moving forward in peace rather than justice for past crimes.  Both sides accepted this and the peace was built.  It is a testament to the strength of that peace that we now recognise that this looking the other way is not only no longer acceptable but is no longer necessary.  Nobody should look the other way when crimes are being committed.  <\/p><p>The latest development in the political crisis was sparked by the shooting of Kevin McGuigan.  The police have said current members of the IRA were involved in the shooting - a revelation that has heaped pressure on Sinn F&eacute;in to explain why the &quot;supposedly&quot; defunct paramilitary organisation is still in existence.  This must be researched.  I heard the former Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, say on the radio last month and write in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>four or five weeks ago about what happened when he was in power at the time the Provisional IRA &quot;stood down&quot;.  He said that the Irish and British governments deliberately allowed the Provisional IRA to continue as an &quot;unarmed and withering husk&quot; rather than risk a dissident group filling the void left by its disbandment.  We must now investigate whether this &quot;withering husk&quot; is coming to the fore.  <\/p><p>Thankfully, Northern Ireland today is not what it once was.  The people of Northern Ireland have tasted enough peace now that it has become a stable part of life there.  That could be seen in the many recent interviews of ordinary people asking for elected representatives to get on with the job they are paid to do.  Any threat to that peace is rightly seen as crime against the rule of law and against all communities of Northern Ireland.  This week, the Secretary of State also announced that there will be enhanced support and resources for tackling criminality in Northern Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is in keeping with the Government's strong determination to tackle crime, including organised crime.  The Secretary of State said that where cross-Border crime is in question there is also very strong North-South co-operation involving the police.  I support Senator Paul Coghlan.  The Secretary of State said that ways to further enhance the excellent work of the co-operation between North and South will be examined.  I stress that part of the Secretary of State's statement, and support Senator Paul Coghlan in his call for a North-South corridor because more co-operation is needed.  Senator Paul Coghlan and Senator Walsh, and the fine report by the North-South body on the diesel laundering situation, have shown that a blind eye is being turned and it is no longer necessary.  As joint custodians of peace in Northern Ireland, it is everybody's responsibility, including Sinn Fein's responsibility, to openly face the elements or some elements that may at one time have been connected to their organisation, be they known or unknown, which act as a threat to peace and the rule of law and which do not take ownership of peace and the prosperity of all the people of Northern Ireland rather than one community over the other.  We cannot have a split community.  If people are in government together, they should govern as a whole for the entire community.  It is their responsibility to face those elements and a culture that shies away from the type of transparency demanded of a parliamentary party in a democracy.  It is the Sinn F&eacute;in attitude to truth - that truth can be moulded to fit an ideology - that is a cause of concern and a cause of breakdown not only in the North but throughout the whole of Ireland.<\/p><p>The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government has had to make tough decisions to get this country out of the economic mess it inherited.

This can only be to the benefit of those on both sides who do not want politics to work.  It has the potential to see us go back to the bad old days of conflict, with the darkness that it entailed.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for the manner in which he has handled the situation from the Government's perspective.  He is making a positive contribution to ensure the Assembly and the Executive will continue to function and offer a democratic alternative in Northern Ireland to the mindless and unfortunate decades of violence we all had to endure.<\/p><p>There are many issues still to be sorted out such as the legacies of the past.  Many groups with outstanding issues will address tomorrow's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  They will look for movement and some closure.  It is often said Northern Ireland politicians are impossible and stuck in the past.  For some, this is undoubtedly true.  However, we should also take time to consider the unbelievable burden of history that they face when trying to move things forward, even for those who sometimes appear to be intransigent in their views.  A fellow once said to Lester Piggott, &quot;I thought you were going to come there, Lester,&quot; to which he replied, &quot;Well, you can't come without the horse.&quot;  Sometimes it is difficult for those concerned to leave their people, but most are actually trying to do this.  It is not easy, however, to move the tectonic plates to progress.  In that sense, I welcome the comments of Senator Sean D. Barrett who referred to the launch last week of a book entitled, <i>Uncomfortable Conversations<\/i>.  I was not able to attend the event, but I did read about it.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Gerry Adams, with whom I do not often agree, say the united Ireland which might happen might not be the one we had envisaged historically.  He was talking about inclusion.  The British ambassador, Mr. Dominick Chilcott, said one could not expect republicans to become unionists or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We are looking at inclusion, which is why this morning I raised the issue of a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor and general election candidate in Donaghmede who was calling the hierarchy in rugby West Brits.  There is no hierarchy of Irishness.  I am not saying any of the three Sinn F&eacute;in Senators present would ever do this; I do not believe they would.  However, it is important for us - no matter who says these things, whether it be a Fine Gaeler or a Sinn F&eacute;iner - to let them know that we are moving on.  Even if the conversations are uncomfortable, we want to have them.  That is why we need to get the institutions up and moving fully again to sort out the things that need to be sorted out.  <\/p><p>It should be remembered that sometimes the process is as important as the product.  Often it is more important and significant.  As someone who lives in a Border area, I would like to see an enhanced task force to deal with criminal activities, including diesel laundering, petrol stretching and cigarette smuggling.  I will not say who is at it because I do not know, but we do know who people say is at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#QQ00100","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Do not stand for such a rumour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#QQ00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I am not standing up for them.

I compliment the Minister on the proactive role he has played in the past few months, particularly in the light of the recent threat to the institutions in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned all parties, but I am not sure whether he was talking about the North or the South.  In the South we can support all of the initiatives in the world, but at the end of the day it is about what happens behind closed doors at Stormont between the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland and the dominant parties - the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  <\/p> <p>I acknowledge what I believe is the statesman-like position Mr. Martin McGuinness has taken.  I have always had great respect for him because he has never at any time shied away from the reality of his background in Derry.  He has admitted that he was not only a member of the IRA but also that he was an active member, unlike his party colleague, Deputy Gerry Adams, but I am not going to go down that road.  <\/p> <p>I welcome Senator David Cullinane's renewed commitment to opposing criminality in all its forms.  Whenever I hear Sinn F&eacute;in representatives condemning criminality in their new political guise I cannot help it, but my mind keeps flipping back over a lot of murders in this State, not to mention what happened in Northern Ireland, in the name of Irish republicanism and the cause of freedom of Ireland, that of Detective Jerry McCabe being one.  There was the young man who went into a bank in Waterford with his son who was shot in front of him.  Sinn F&eacute;in gave the driver of the getaway car a medal at its ard fheis.  As that only happened in the last two years, forgive me if I sound a little cynical.<\/p> <p>I do not wish in any way to undermine the commitment Sinn F&eacute;in's elected members have, particularly in Northern Ireland, to maintaining the institutions.  I know from first-hand experience of dealing with Sinn F&eacute;in representatives through the North-South Implementation Bodies and at the various committee meetings I have attended at Stormont in recent years that Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to maintaining the institutions in Northern Ireland perhaps even a little more than it is given credit for.  However, it seems to have a blind spot when it comes to the political realities of facing two sides at the one time - facing the electorate in Northern Ireland and in the South which have different dynamics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#QQ00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Did the Senator want us to take the Assembly down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#QQ00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>In that context, we have had disagreements about welfare cuts, to which Sinn F&eacute;in will not sign up.

It has consistently and persistently supported a non-violent way forward for the North and the South.  The party and its voters are to be given credit for adopting this position.  Its voters have alternatives, but they have stuck rigidly to the view that the way forward is through constitutional politics.  In the light of the position Sinn F&eacute;in has taken on the North, I have a great deal of sympathy for the party.  Anybody watching what happens and is happening in the United Kingdom will see that the Tory Government, a very right-wing government, wants to cut public expenditure on social welfare by &euro;12 billion, which is more than half of the total social welfare budget in this country.  The most recent BBC report I saw indicated the Tory Government was to reduce tax credits for those in low paid employment, which will push them over the edge and into the poverty trap again.  I understand where Sinn F&eacute;in is coming from politically.  However, what is the alternative?  The party is relying on the bloc grant from Westminster and it appears the Tory Government is not for turning in that regard.  Not only is Northern Ireland being affected by its social welfare policies; all of the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom are being affected also.  I hope what is happening will not ultimately be a deal breaker and that there will be some light at the end of the tunnel in that regard.<\/p><p>The DUP obviously wants to maintain the institutions.  I know from talking to DUP members that they do not want the administration to collapse either.  The mere fact that it ensured Arlene Foster remained as acting First Minister sent a very strong message that it to wanted to have some resolution of the issue.  I hope the two Governments will be a little more proactive in this regard.  After all, the Government of the Republic, with that of the United Kingdom, is a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is sometimes forgotten.  Perhaps it is not something Unionists want to hear about Southern Irish involvement, but the treaty is an international one that was voted on freely in a democratic fashion by people on all sides on the island.  It was the first time it had happened since 1918.  Therefore, the DUP cannot run away from its responsibilities in this regard.  The Irish Government should be playing a more proactive part and it is about time heads were banged together.<\/p><p>I agree fully with what was said about the so-called peace walls.  It is an absolute disgrace that in this day and age, at a time when we are talking about peace and moving forward, there are walls dividing communities in Belfast and that one, in particular, is a tourist attraction.  I am glad to note that there have been some moves in recent weeks towards dismantling some of these peace walls.  There is no way society in the North, or communities there that are divided physically, apart from psychologically or historically, can have any hope for the future until these walls disappear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#QQ00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  The North is close to his constituency.  <\/p> <p>The lack of engagement by the two Governments is the reason there is an impasse.  There were attempts, in dealing with the past and flags, to come up with a solution.  The US Government became involved in dealing with certain issues and there were failed talks, but there was no substantive engagement.  There was some, but there is a need for high level engagement by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to resolve the issues involved.  However, that is not really what is of concern to the citizens of Northern Ireland; what are of concern to them are the issues that affect their daily lives, including the cuts to social welfare and services and the block grant in the North proposed by the Tory Government.<\/p> <p>To a large degree, the issue that is causing the collapse of the structures in the North is being used by both sides to get away from what affects people in their daily lives in the North.  That is a consequence of the Stormont House Agreement.  Now we have a political crisis, largely created by politicians for their own ends, and the ordinary citizen in the North is concerned.  Catholics, Protestants, Unionists and Nationalists are concerned about the cuts coming their way, yet politics has failed them in that regard in that there has been no engagement.<\/p> <p>I agree with my colleagues that the North is a special case in respect of the block grant.  I acknowledge the argument being made by Tory MPs that the North is receiving more proportionately than Scotland and Wales, but I do not really care because the North is a special case.  If we want a peace dividend, we need to invest more.<\/p> <p>On the issues of dealing with the past, parades and flags, the engagement by the British Government has been appalling.  It has refused to hand over the files on the Dublin&ndash;Monaghan bombings, the largest bombing and biggest mass murder in the history of the State.  The bombings happened not one mile from Leinster House.  The report of Mr. Justice Barron is quite clear and unequivocal in stating the bombings could not have happened without the assistance of the British Army and security forces.  One in three of the deaths in the North was caused by loyalist paramilitaries with the assistance of the British security forces.  That is the past, but we cannot move forward until the British Government agrees to hand over the files.  However, that will not break the impasse because the real issue is that the Stormont House Agreement was going to cause political problems for all parties in the North.  The British Government needs to give more funding because whatever funding it will have to give to solve the problems associated with the proposed social welfare cuts will be nothing by comparison with the cost that would be incurred if there were to be a resurgence of paramilitary activity and a reignition of the Troubles.  We are asking the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister to become involved at the highest level and for the renegotiation of the Stormont House Agreement.  The immediate issue concerning the IRA must be examined, but a solution is possible.<\/p> <p>What is occurring has been used by all sides to try to distract from the real issues affecting the day-to-day lives of citizens in the North and the need to improve their lives and ensure they can go about their normal business.  Most of what is happening is, to a large degree, being used for political purposes.  Long-term, sustained engagement by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, not just engagement when there is a crisis, is required if we are to have the solutions required to keep the peace in the North.  Dealing with the past, flags and parades is part of this process, but the Stormont House Agreement needs to be addressed.  Whatever funding is required from the British Exchequer to ensure the stability we have witnessed in recent years is maintained is a matter the Government needs to pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#RR00200","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Senator James Heffernan.<\/p> <p>Like many others in Ireland, I am extremely disappointed that there is such political instability in Northern Ireland 17 years after the signing of the historic Good Friday Agreement.  In April 1998, after 30 years of conflict in which 3,500 people were killed, there was much rejoicing over an agreement being put in place to address the many issues that had divided communities and politicians over the decades.  Much praise was rightly lavished on politicians from all sides and community leaders who had made many compromises in the interests of peace.  The people of Ireland, North and South, strongly endorsed the Agreement and expected it to be fully implemented.  World leaders hailed it as a template that could be replicated in other war-torn parts of the world.  Some, however, referred to it as \"Sunningdale for slow learners\" and bemoaned the fact that if such an agreement had been reached in 1973, it would have saved many lives that had been lost in the intervening 25 years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael Mullins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While much has been achieved since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in bringing to an end much of the violence, the reform of the policing system, cross-Border and security co-operation, progress on many aspects of the Agreement has been unacceptably slow and disappointing.  The Agreement was designed to address some of the roadblocks such as identity issues, the welfare system and the making of the government's finances in Northern Ireland more sustainable.  I acknowledge the part played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan; the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers; the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  All parties signed up to the Agreement, but when tough political decisions had to be taken, agreement could not be reached.  The legacy of paramilitarism and criminality is a major stumbling block and the recent murder of Mr. McGuigan, a matter for the police to resolve, has caused great uncertainty.  The issue of criminality and racketeering and the need for additional police resources are obviously being addressed, but cool heads must now get involved.  All parties should be brought to the table in order that a lasting solution can be found to the difficulties being encountered.  Nobody wants to go back to the bad old days when there was a risk of loss of life.  There were major issues to be resolved relating to policing and criminality.  On this side of the Border we have an interest in that livelihoods are being impacted on, as are people's properties.

I spent most of my childhood hearing about the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Since the Good Friday Agreement life has changed immeasurably for the better.  I have spoken to members in Northern Ireland about this issue and they reliably tell me that the peace process is on life support.<\/p> <p>I have reservations about the DUP taking the stance its members did on the basis of one police statement.  That said, there are serious issues of trust at stake and I urge the Minister to ask the Taoiseach to commit himself fully to getting the Executive and the Assembly at Stormont up and running again.  What could be more important to our island than peace?  That is all we want - peace and stability.  They cannot be put at stake.  The suspension of talks or the Assembly would only serve one purpose - the needs of extremists.  That is something to which we do not want to go back.<\/p> <p>I have reservations about the lack of trust that has crept into the situation in Northern Ireland on issues such as welfare reform.  As I understand it, Mr. Martin McGuinness had committed himself to a Second Stage Reading, but when the Ard Chomhairle of Sinn F&eacute;in met in the South, with one eye on the forthcoming general election here, the entire tone in Northern Ireland changed.  Naturally, I would be very cynical about this.  Criminality has been ongoing, but there have been no arrests for up to ten years.  It would be outrageous if people were turning a blind eye.  Everybody has to wake up to this, as we do to the serious stories of abuse and the kangaroo courts of the IRA.  There is a continuum of violence.  <\/p> <p>As for solutions, the Taoiseach and Mr. Cameron must show leadership.  If the Taoiseach wants to show that he is a statesman before this term in government expires, this is the way to do it rather than through cheap electioneering, for which there is no need.  That is what everybody expects.  That is the micro stuff; this is the macro picture for the island.  As the Irish and British Governments are co-guarantors of the peace process, let us, please, measure up.  There must be arrests for engaging in criminal activitiy and we need an independent monitoring commission, ideally to be chaired by an American diplomat.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There would be a measure of verification and proof to show that all the actors in this situation are genuine: Sinn Fein, the DUP, the SDLP and whoever is managing the IRA.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, for his presence also.  He has been involved in the British Irish Parliamentary Association and the Good Friday Agreement and is certainly on top of his brief in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach is accused by some of not being fully engaged.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade outlined that the Taoiseach has been in constant contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, almost hourly, in all negotiations.  There is a sustained engagement between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on these issues.  We have had a good debate and many issues were raised including the need for a task force to combat criminality.  Also raised was the high level of legacy issues such as collusion between the British army and Loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles.

I have grouped the amendments on emotional abuse and neglect and I wish to start with the words of the American novelist Carson McCullers who said:<\/p><blockquote>The hearts of small children are delicate organs.  A cruel beginning in this world can twist them into curious shapes.<\/blockquote> <p>It is extremely important that we identify the name &quot;emotional abuse&quot; as a stand-alone form of abuse which, when sustained, has a devastating effect on children's&rsquo; lives and on through into adulthood.  Emotional abuse is often the first abuse to occur and then escalates into other forms of abuse.  We talk about the importance of early intervention and we should not underestimate the message we send by excluding emotional abuse from this Bill.<\/p><p>What message are we giving?  Emotional abuse is about control and power.  When we look at barring and protection orders containing statements such as &quot;You cannot use abusive language&quot;, it makes one think that if we can define this in law for adults why is it different for a child?  I have one case I was dealing with where a parent tells the child every day that they were born angry and then wonders why the child, at the age of 12, presents with an anger problem.<\/p><p>In this Bill &quot;harm&quot; includes neglect.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 read together alter the definition of neglect to include emotional abuse, though only where the emotional abuse significantly and seriously injures the emotional, social or psychological welfare of the child.  The definition of emotional abuse is largely drawn from its definition in the Children First guidance, subject to the caveat that behaviour or omission to behave will not be treated as emotional abuse for the purpose of this Act unless it has a significant and serious impact on the child.  This is a relatively high threshold which is designed to ensure that minor infractions or subjective differences in relation to best practise in parenting do not become subject of investigation.<\/p><p>The amendment is clearly framed so that only behaviour or omissions to behave that have a significant and serious effect on the emotional, social or psychological welfare of the child are deemed to constitute emotional abuse.  The examples given in subsections (i) through (xi) of amendment No. 1, are not exhaustive, they are without prejudice to the generality of the substantive definition and are drawn directly from Children First.  It is important to note that a single or isolated incident of any of these examples may not be enough in itself to constitute emotional abuse in the sense in which it is defined in the amendment.  These examples are nonetheless useful in helping to identify emotional abuse though they are subject to the caveat that the effects of the behaviour or omission to behave must be serious.<\/p><p>I bring these amendments to the Minister because I have dealt with cases where children have solely been emotionally abused and it has ended up in court and it has been dealt with by the courts.  I feel that by excluding emotional abuse from this Bill we are sending a wrong message.  In some way we are saying that it does not have the same devastating impact that other forms of abuse can have.  That is why I have tabled these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#TT00800","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

The requirement is that the mandated person reports harm or risk of harm to a child.  Harm is defined as assault, ill-treatment or neglect that is or is likely to seriously affect the child&rsquo;s health, development or welfare.  Harm also includes sexual abuse.  On ill-treatment and neglect, the threshold for reporting is there for where the ill-treatment or neglect seriously affects the child&rsquo;s health development or welfare.

On Report and Final Stages of the Gender Recognition Bill on Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the Minister for State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, said he would be happy for the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to lead on the issue of gender recognition with children because he is the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and his Department has a wider remit than that of the Department of Social Protection on this issue.  Will the Minister consider inserting in future legislation a provision to amend the gender recognition legislation, so the exemption process for 16 to 18 year olds is depathologised in a manner similar to the application process for adults and to include the creation of a process for interim gender recognition certificate for those under 16 so that their rights are fully realised in that process?<\/p><p>I thank Fergus Ryan, Department of Law, Maynooth University, and Tanya N&iacute; Mhuirthile, the School of Law and Government, Dublin City University, for helping me draft these amendments.  Returning to amendment No. 5, child pornography is defined under section 2 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  The definition includes any visual representation that shows a child engaged in, or being a witness to, explicit sexual activity and, where the dominant characteristic of a visual representation is the depiction for a sexual purpose of the genital or anal region of a child.<\/p><p>The majority of law enforcement agencies working in this area, most notably Interpol and Europol, believe it is time to stop the use of the misleading term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; when describing images of the sexual abuse of children.  According to Interpol, the world&rsquo;s largest policing organisation:<\/p><blockquote>A sexual image of a child is &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; or &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; and should never be described as &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;.  Pornography is a term used for adults engaging in consensual sexual acts distributed (mostly) legally to the general public for their sexual pleasure.  Child abuse images are not.  They involve children who cannot and would not consent and who are victims of a crime.  The child abuse images are documented evidence of a crime in progress - a child being sexually abused.<\/blockquote> <p>I have been saying this since I first tabled a motion on blocking child abuse material on the Internet in February 2012.  Child sexual abuse material is far more than child pornography.  The image or depiction is a culmination of at best one, and more than likely a series, of the most serious criminal offences known to our Statute Book, including rape, incest, assault, sadism and bestiality.  For each child sexual abuse image produced, it can be expected that numerous offences are committed, as the online distribution of child abuse images exponentially multiplies the number of offences against the sexual integrity of the child.<\/p><p>A child sexual abuse image is a crime scene, a digital record of sexual abuse being perpetrated against a real child in the real world.  I will be seeking to have the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; in this Bill and across our Statute Book amended to &ldquo;child sexual abuse material&rdquo; to better reflect the seriousness of the offence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I welcome the publication of the sexual offences Bill.

Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, have stated that it is intended that this review will incorporate issues concerning transgender children.  None the less, I am aware that for some, the lack of an explicit legal commitment in that regard is a cause of concern.  The fact that the review clause is not triggered until the Act is two years in operation does not mean that further consideration of these issues should wait until then.  In recognition of the fact that transgender children often experience difficulties in their day-to-day lives, the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, has undertaken to chair a round table discussion with stakeholders to discuss the practical issues that transgender children experience in school settings.  This is due to take place on 6 October and I hope it will help to identify the practical needs of transgender children and the steps that will be taken to address them.  <\/p> <p>I, along with many of my colleagues, was very moved by the testimonies of transgender children, their parents and representatives, during the development and passage of the Gender Recognition Bill.  I am conscious, too, that research in this area remains a developing field.  I have met with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, on these matters.  I believe we are agreed on the need to learn as much as possible so that we can develop a robust and effective policy which both supports and protects transgender children and young people and their families.<\/p> <p>I recently published Ireland's first national strategy on children and young people's participation in decision-making to ensure that children and young people have a voice in their individual and collective everyday lives.  As part of that process of learning, I have committed to a consultation process with children and young people which we intend to begin before the year's end.  This will give transgender children and young people an opportunity to have their voices heard and will support them in making a meaningful contribution to the review of the Gender Recognition Act.<\/p> <p>To further support the process of informing the review, I have asked my officials to progress a number of relevant issues in 2016.  These include considering a legislative amendment to copperfasten the incorporation in the review of the Gender Recognition Act a consideration of the needs of children and young people, including those not eligible under the Act; gathering further research and evidence regarding the issue as it relates to children and young people; and further liaison with the medical and other relevant professions on their potential role in assessing needs of children and young people as part of the eligibility to apply for a gender recognition certificate.<\/p> <p>I fully understand and, indeed, share Senator van Turnhout's concerns in this area.  However, before taking further legislative steps, further consideration, consultation and research needs to be undertaken in a measured way to inform how we as a Government should best address the needs of transgender children.  I will be consulting further with a number of groups to seek their assistance in collating and distilling the research and data available in respect of Irish young people.  This and the consultation process will assist in clarifying the most appropriate policy position, especially for children aged under 16, in this very complex policy area.<\/p> <p>I will now address amendment No. 5.  I would like to thank the Senator for her amendment and her continuing dedication in seeking to strengthen the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendment.  The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is not within my remit and is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy. Frances Fitzgerald.  I am advised that section 2 of the 1998 Act contains an extensive definition of the term child pornography which is compliant with a number of international legal instruments.<\/p> <p>I note that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald today published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, which I welcome very warmly.  The Bill includes wide-ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation, including enhancing the existing definition of child pornography to comply with the requirements of EU Directive 2011\/93\/EU, as well as other international instruments.  I am sure we all welcome this strengthening of the legal provisions protecting children against sexual exploitation.<\/p> <p>While I agree with the Senator that the term \"child pornography\" is outdated and fails to reflect the full horror of the sexual abuse involved, for the reasons she has so eloquently outlined, it is still the language used in the international instruments by which we are bound, not least the relevant EU directive and the Council of Europe's Lanzarote Convention.<\/p> <p>While I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendment today, I will pass her proposals on to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, for her consideration, perhaps in the context of discussing and amending the sexual offences Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#VV00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and compliment my colleague, Senator van Turnhout.

I have worked with Peter for many years on this issue, including when I was the chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance.<\/p><p>In November 2012, the people of Ireland voted to enshrine children&rsquo;s rights into the Irish Constitution and while the result was appealed, the decision was signed into law on 28 April 2015.  I am delighted to have an updated copy of the Constitution, which firmly places children's rights at its heart.  Article 42A.1  states clearly: &quot;The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.&quot;<\/p><p>What I am proposing in this amendment is to ensure that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law.  Why do we still believe it is acceptable for corporal punishment to be in our laws?  The Committee on the Rights of the Child defines &ldquo;corporal&rdquo; or &ldquo;physical&rdquo; punishment as any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light.  Most such punishment involves hitting, smacking, slapping or spanking children, with the hand or with an implement such as a whip, stick, belt, shoe or wooden spoon, etc.  However, it can also involve, for example, kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion.  In the view of the committee, corporal punishment is invariably degrading.<\/p><p>Adults have a talent for inventing euphemisms to make them feel more comfortable while they inflict pain and humiliation such as spanking or smacking.  The truth is that, for a child, all of this is violence and if it was directed at an adult it would constitute criminal assault.  I am very conscious that when I raise this issue, people often believe it is a judgment on how they were raised.  I take this opportunity to welcome my mother, Jenny, to the Visitors Gallery and she will concur that I was raised with the phrase &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not too old for the wooden spoon&rdquo; ringing in my ears.  Thankfully, she never had to use the spoon.  I wonder whether it is only in Ireland that the wooden spoon is not seen solely as a kitchen utensil but as a weapon.  Times have moved on and our understanding of the effects of corporal punishment on children has increased. <\/p><p>There are many other good reasons to ban corporal punishment: it causes serious harm to children; it teaches children that violence is an acceptable way of solving conflicts; it is ineffective as a means of discipline and there are positive ways to teach, correct or discipline children which are better for the child&rsquo;s development and health; and it is more difficult to protect children from severe abuse if some forms of violence are legitimate.  In tandem with this, we must provide parents with sufficient support in bringing up their children, including educating and supporting parents to develop good parenting skills.<\/p><p>Some 28 states in wider Europe have prohibited all corporal punishment, including in the family.  Another 51 states have clearly and publicly committed to achieving a full ban.  Ireland has been found in violation of the European social charter by the Council of Europe body, the European Committee of Social Rights.  I hope the Government will find itself in a position to accept this amendment because it is the right thing to do.  We must uphold and protect children&rsquo;s rights.<\/p><p>In preparing from this debate I read a quote from Janusz Korczak, who as any children's rights activist would know is a Polish-Jewish paediatrician, educationalist and children&rsquo;s author.  In 1925 in his book &ldquo;The Child&rsquo;s Right to Respect&rdquo; he said:<\/p><blockquote>In what extraordinary circumstances would one dare to push, hit or tug an adult?  And yet it is considered so routine and harmless to give a child a tap or stinging smack or to grab it by the arm.  The feeling of powerlessness creates respect for power.  Not only adults but anyone who is older and stronger can cruelly demonstrate their displeasure, back up their words with force, demand obedience and abuse the child without being punished.  We set an example that fosters contempt for the weak.  This is bad parenting and sets a bad precedent.<\/blockquote> <p>In a publication in Sweden to mark over 30 years on from Sweden&rsquo;s abolition of corporal punishment, their then Minister, Maria Larsson, wrote:<\/p><blockquote>When violence is used against children, their confidence in the adult world is damaged.  And there is good reason to believe that if this violence is exercised by the child&rsquo;s own parent, or by someone else close to them, the damage is greater.<\/blockquote> <p>Sweden introduced its laws in 1979 and they are now over 35 years in place.<\/p><p>Since 2006, the European Union has emphasised the promotion and protection of children&rsquo;s rights as a priority issue.  The European Parliament, in a 2009 resolution on the situation of fundamental rights across the Union, called for a total ban on corporal punishment in all member states.  Again in November 2014, the Parliament adopted a resolution calling on member states to uphold their obligations and combat any form of violence against children, &ldquo;including by formally prohibiting and sanctioning corporal punishment against children&rdquo;. <\/p><p>Recently at UN level, Ireland through our permanent representative to the United Nations, David Donoghue, and our mission to the UN, has had a central role in the process as co-facilitators of the negotiations together with Kenya on &quot;Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&rdquo;.  Goal 16.2 is to &quot;End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.&quot;  Colleagues, children&rsquo;s rights experts and advocates in Ireland concur.<\/p><p>In preparing for debate on this Bill, Tanya Ward, chief executive of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance said:<\/p><blockquote>The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance unites over 100 organisations working with children and their families across the country.  Since our establishment in 1995 we have repeatedly called for the removal from Irish law of the defence of reasonable chastisement of children.<br \/><br \/>Research is clear that corporal punishment has no benefits and can cause children physical and psychological harm and can lead to short and long-term effects on their safety, health and development.  There is no justification for corporal punishment and it is clearly at odds with Article 42A of the Constitution which &ldquo;recognises and affirms the [ ... ] rights of all children&rdquo; and commits to protect and vindicate those rights by its laws.  Children have an absolute right to be protected from harm and abuse under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Ireland ratified in 1992, there are no exceptions.<br \/><br \/>This coming January, Ireland&rsquo;s progress on children&rsquo;s rights will be examined by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee criticised Ireland&rsquo;s position on corporal punishment in 1998 and 2006 and are likely to do so again in 2016.  The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance has been leading the civil society engagement with the UN Committee and has prioritised corporal punishment as a key concern.  There is no reason to delay, Ireland has a moral and legal duty to protect children from corporal punishment. <\/blockquote> <p>Grania Long, chief executive of the ISPCC says:<\/p><blockquote>As the national child protection charity, the ISPCC has long supported a ban on physical punishment of children.  Through our national listening service, Childline, we hear on a daily basis the impact of violence towards children.  Last year we responded to nearly 37,000 contacts from children regarding abuse or welfare, and many were from children who were anxious, traumatised and scared in their own home, due to violence.<br \/><br \/>We strongly support the amendment to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, and believes that it meets the spirit and intent of the Children First legislation.  Whatever the circumstance, there is no reason why the law should permit a defence of hurt or violence towards a child.  Far too often, the debate centres on the needs or preferences of parents, rather than the rights of the child.  The recent change to our constitution following the Children&rsquo;s Referendum requires us to think very differently and put children at the heart of our considerations.  Seanad members therefore have a long overdue and timely opportunity to place in law the right of a child to be safe in their own home, and we hope this opportunity will be grasped, in the best interests of children. <\/blockquote> <p>I am very conscious of the role of parents, so I contacted Laura Haugh, mum-in-residence and spokesperson for <i>MummyPages.ie<\/i>.  She says that <i>MummyPages.ie <\/i>is Ireland's largest online parenting community and its members wholeheartedly support the campaign to repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement by parents and childminders of up to three children in Irish law.  She says that slapping another person, especially a vulnerable child is wrong in all circumstances.  She believes that allowing slapping by a caregiver to a child under the term &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot;' is legalising physical violence to another person and a form of child abuse.  It demonstrates that it is okay for a person to hit another person and that it is okay for a bigger or stronger person to hit a smaller or weaker person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This kind of behaviour can lead to intense abuse in the home for the child who does not learn quickly from reasonable chastisement and is at complete odds with what is acceptable in today's adult society or, indeed, the school playground.  Initially, the child is so hurt by the physical action and emotional breakdown of trust between parent and child that he or she forgets what he or she has done wrong.  What we want in effective discipline is for the child to understand what he or she has done wrong and the consequences of his or her actions for others.  We want the child to feel remorse but, ultimately, to still believe that he or she is a person of value.  Slapping does not promote this.<br\/><br\/>Ms Haugh believes the main principle in promoting desirable behaviour is for the child to feel good and, therefore, be good.  This is why regular positive affirmation of good behaviour is a much more effective tool than any other in the context of maintaining this type of behaviour.  It is now well researched that when responding to an incident with a child that requires discipline, tuning in to the child to understand exactly why he or she misbehaved, helping him or her to realise how his or her behaviour might affect others and consistent follow-through with age appropriate consequences is much more effective than physical chastisement, no matter how reasonable the latter perceived to be.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious of the comments made last February by Pope Francis.  While I did not appreciate his comments, it was encouraging to see the response both nationally and at the level of the Vatican.  In particular, I wish to cite the letter to<i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Mary McAleese, who noted that the Vatican is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and that the committee monitoring this wants all corporal punishment of children to be banned.  She added that, in submissions to that committee last year, the Vatican said it did not promote corporal punishment, citing &quot;respect for the inviolability of physical life and the integrity of the person&quot;.  The Vatican has responded by appointing Peter Saunders, founder of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, a UK-based organisation, to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.  Mr. Saunders was asked lead the non-violence against children working group of that commission.  I contacted Mr. Saunders earlier today and he advised me that the working group members are unanimous in their position that there is never an instance where violence or reasonable chastisement is ever justifiable.  Irish abuse survivor Marie Collins\u00a0is also a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.  In discussions with both Marie Collins and Peter Saunders, I have found they are extremely supportive of Ireland updating its laws to bring into effect a ban on corporal punishment here.<br\/><br\/>Marta Santos Pais, Special Representative of the Secretary General on Violence against Children, advocates that corporal punishment can be prevented.  She states, &quot;By supporting caregivers in the use of non-violent child rearing practices; by promoting advocacy and social mobilisation to safeguard children's dignity and physical integrity; by reforming laws to introduce a clear ban of all forms of violence including corporal punishment, we can make a real difference in the life of children, all children, everywhere and at all times&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is now out of step with parents, children's rights advocates and international best practice.

He did not see it as a punishment and thought it was great because he had the place to himself and was happy up there.  My daughter was different.  She would have loved to be down in the thick of things and did not like to be sent to her room.<\/p> <p>My granddaughter, who is nearly two, goes to a child minder.  I would hate to think that the child minder would slap her - it would absolutely gut me.  I wonder why we feel like that, why we feel that somebody else cannot hit a child but a parent can hit or slap their child.  Where do we draw the line between reasonable chastisement and what is more physical and violent?  It is best if we get rid of it altogether.  There is no need to slap children.  There are other ways of doing this, such as sending them to their room, stopping them from watching a favourite television programme or something they would not like done to them.  There are ways of doing this without the use of physical violence.<\/p> <p>I very much support Senator van Turnhout's amendment.  I hope the Minister, who is in a position to accept the amendment, will see matters her way.  If we were in school and a child hit another child, we would call that bullying.  However, it is not seen as bullying when a parent slaps their child in the home.  We have to distinguish once and for all whether it is wrong or right for a parent to hit his or her child.<\/p> <p>The European Committee of Social Rights has ruled that Ireland and Slovenia are in violation of the European Social Charter because all corporal punishment of children is not prohibited.  Some 28 Council of Europe member states have prohibited corporal punishments in all settings, including the family home.  In the case of Ireland, the repeated findings by the committee highlight there has been no development towards ensuring children's legal protection from corporal punishment for the past 12 years.  This has been going on for quite some time and nobody has done anything about it.  In fairness to Senator van Turnhout, she has raised the issue and put forward the amendment.  She has already said Deputy Reilly is a caring Minister who has worked hard on behalf of children since he took over as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Everyone in the House will acknowledge that fact.  I hope he will be able to accept this amendment by Senator van Turnhout and not put any of us in a position to have to vote against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#XX00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout on this very well-worded amendment.

The late Deputy John Boland was the Minister who abolished, through legislation, the physical mistreatment of children.  On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the Rising, would it not be a lovely gesture?  The Proclamation deals with the equal rights of children and treating all children equally.  This is one way of doing it.  There is no excuse.  What one is doing is perpetrating violence by using violence, in that they will use violence on their children, and it goes on and on and never ends.<\/p> <p>It would be worthwhile to revisit this issue.  I recommend that there not be a vote today because the Minister might find the issue is accepted by the House.  The Minister should return to the Government and say this is really serious.  Senator van Turnhout has outlined exactly the overall international situation.  Ireland is regarded as a Christian, Catholic country.  Why should it be out of line?  I have been a member of the Council of Europe for the past seven years and I am deputy leader of the delegation from Ireland.  I am embarrassed by this matter being raised, when 27 countries out of 47 have accepted the fact that this is wrong.<\/p> <p>I do not see any justification for it.  I know of the Minister's experience as a medical doctor and I am sure he has experienced children being very scared of parents.  If somebody witnessed a person on a train or in the street hitting a child, they would have to intervene but, as far as I know, they would have no right to intervene because the person hitting the child is exempt from prosecution.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Garda cannot intervene.  Children can test their parents' strength but it is another thing to resort to physical violence.  It is not a question degrees, of saying it is okay to do X, for example, to slap a child on the back or the leg.  It is not okay because that begs the question of where one draws the line, as Senator van Turnhout said.  One could consider all the different degrees.  I am a parent.  My wife, Mary, and I did not do that.  I would find it very difficult to speak in this debate if I was involved in that.  Of course, children drive parents to distraction.  It is very difficult but there are ways to overcome it.  There are different ways of saying that a child cannot go somewhere or that the family are not going to a particular place tomorrow, so the child can forget about it.  There are ways of doing it.  It is so obvious.  I cannot understand why the amendment would not be accepted.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is doing great work in Jobstown and other places to protect children.  One amendment could change the entire attitude to children in this country.  Those who oppose it are the ones who will exercise those rights themselves.<\/p><p>Any parent who is against the corporal punishment of children is opposed to the Government.  I speak as a member of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am not mandated to say it but I would be very disappointed if the Fianna F&aacute;il Party did not support the amendment.  I support it.  I do not consult other people in the party on these issues, I have a gut feeling about them.  I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for some time.  I have served as a Minister of State in the Department of Health and in other Departments.  I know the restrictions on the Minister.  I know the advice he is getting from senior public servants, whom I presume are present, and others.  Will the Minister reflect on the amendment tonight?  In fairness, there was not a vote on the amendment because that commits it too much.  In advance of Report Stage, perhaps the Minister could consider the various repercussions and discuss the matter with his colleagues in government.  He should be prepared to consider the situation.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout has done great work.  She has done the State some service.  Her nomination to serve in this House by the Taoiseach was a very intelligent decision.  The Government appointed so many talented people and she is one of them.  She has brought enormous experience to the House.  We do not have Senator van Turnhout's level of expertise.  We would not be examining the matter in the same depth or with the same expertise without Senator van Turnhout.  She has done much research.  It takes time to do so much work.  She put detailed work into her preparation for the debate on the Bill and has voiced our thoughts, feelings and aspirations.  There is no political mileage to be gained.  Given the anniversary of 1916 in next year, it would be a wonderful gesture if this measure was not delayed but was signed into law so it would come into force 100 years after the Rising, which would mean that the children of Ireland would be protected from abuse inside the home, outside the home, in schools, institutions and everywhere else.  If Senator Jillian van Turnhout can achieve that through her powers of persuasion, her mother would be very proud tonight, as would this country.  We would owe her a great debt of gratitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#XX00500","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I was listening to Senator van Turnhout and I decided I must come to the Chamber.  Her speech was splendid.  I received a message from the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>recently seeking views on Dr. Cyril Daly, a fellow medical practitioner of the Minister, who led this campaign for a very long time in Ireland.  I am working on that coincidence first.  The Minister mentioned that John Boland was a neighbour of his in the north of the county.  I hope all those portents are good.  Former Senator, Owen Skeffington, was a predecessor of mine who ran with this campaign.  We were told that somebody said to him in the House one day &quot;I was beaten when I was a child.  It didn&rsquo;t do me any harm,&quot;, and Skeffington replied, &quot;The question is what did do the harm.&quot;  The House of Lords would have probably had a spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child view, that corporal punishment is good for somebody, that it will make a man out of him, etc.  It is Victorian stuff that children should be seen and not heard.  It is completely outdated by developments in education, such as Montessori schools among others.  It is also completely outdated by the way we see children with their friends now.  We would never dream of beating them.  Violence does not solve problems.  As Senator van Turnhout said, it is an abuse of power for any big person to hit a small person.  I hope the Minister will reflect on the matter, as Senator Leyden suggested.<\/p><p>We just had a referendum which probably would have been undreamt of previously.  That referendum was possible because the people are far more radical than we are in here.  The people of this country do not want children to be beaten by adults in any context.  Unfortunately, it used to happen most when children were smaller.  There was a certain amount of bullying in primary schools.  The atmosphere in primary schools is different now.  Children want to go to school.  Previously, when children came home and said they got slapped in school they were told they must have done something to deserve it.  We have moved on from all those outdated ways of looking at things.  The Minister takes a radical approach to smoking.  I am trying to exercise whatever charm I might possess in order to persuade him to be radical on this matter as well.  The portents are very good in terms of what Cyril Daly and John Boland did and what former Senator Owen Skeffington advocated here, in addition to what the electorate recently decided.  The old way of viewing children is completely outdated.

The matter to which it relates is important and one in respect of which I share the objective sought by the Senator.  I also take this opportunity to repeat that the Government is fully committed to working towards the elimination of corporal punishment and to further protecting children from violence.  I wish to comment on something to which a number of Senators, including Senator Henry, alluded.  It puts me in mind that what we do in law is to send a strong message that we hope will be followed by a cultural shift.  In the context of the marriage equality referendum, we sent out a very strong message but we know there is still bias out there against same-sex couples.  We believe that, through the referendum, we have sent a very strong message to the effect that such bias is not acceptable in Irish society anymore and that the position will change.  Equally, I believe the same will be the case in respect of the matter under discussion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Although various provisions exist under Irish law and administrative measures that prohibit, or aim to prohibit, the use of corporal punishment in non-family settings, it has been acknowledged that these arrangements do not reach the standard required by international instruments to which Ireland is a party, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe's Revised Social Charter.<\/p><p>In that very context, earlier this year Ireland was found to be in violation of the Revised Social Charter.  This was the second such finding; the previous one having been made in 2004.  As I view the particular matter as one of equality before the law, rather than any intrusion on the exercise of legitimate parental authority, I resolved to set about addressing this issue as quickly as possible.  Accordingly, in its response to the finding of a violation Ireland gave particular commitments to the Council of Europe.<\/p><p>The first of these commitments related to bringing in regulations to expressly prohibit in law the use of corporal punishment in certain State child care settings where this was not already the case, essentially covering foster care and residential care situations.  I am pleased to inform the House that preparations for making such regulations are almost complete and I would hope to be in a position to sign them into law shortly.<\/p><p>The second commitment related to the matter of the common law defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" which is the subject of the Senator's amendment.  In that regard, Ireland undertook to the Council of Europe to initiate arrangements to examine the potential, under the Irish legal framework, to remove this defence.  This is something my Department has been working on actively and purposefully since the commitment was given a number of months ago.<\/p><p>A proposed provision in law which involves children, their parents and the State has considerable chance of engaging issues of constitutional rights and therefore needs to be very carefully examined.  A very thorough and sure-footed approach is required in preparing any measure to reduce the prospect of a successful challenge in the future, which will not be to anyone's benefit and certainly not that of children.  I do not want this House to be responsible for my proposing a law that will be struck down by the courts. <\/p><p>The aim of the current work by my Department is to ensure that there is the strongest possible policy and legal grounding for action in this potentially legally sensitive area.  These steps constitute a normal, prudent approach to ensuring that legislative measures, particularly where the State interacts with the family, consider implications and vulnerabilities as extensively as possible to provide the greatest level of confidence that the measure is sustainable.  In other words, we want it to stick.  Given the advanced stage of that work, I consider that it may be possible to bring it to completion very soon and indeed to coincide with a Report Stage consideration of the Senator's amendment.  I therefore respectfully suggest for the Senator's consideration that she agree to postpone determination of her amendment until Report Stage.  At that time I expect to be in a position to let her know whether or not such an amendment can be accepted.<\/p><p>I have been in discussions with the Attorney General and with my Department as late as yesterday morning and this morning and we are very hopeful.  There is absolutely no ideological issue here.  Everybody wants this to happen.  I do not want to leave this behind us.  I am very much struck by what Senator Leyden has said as we come into 2016, that we honour that proclamation in a very real way.  I ask for forbearance.  Time is against me in that I cannot with absolute authority or confidence accept the amendment today but I have no doubt that by Report Stage, one way or the other, there will be a clear answer on this.  If I have my way we will have this defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" removed from the Statute Book.  I hope the Senator will accept my bona fides on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#YY00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I absolutely accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides on this issue and, as has been in evidence in the House tonight, we all share that objective.  I acknowledge the work being done by the officials in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and by the Attorney General.<\/p><p>I am cognisant that it could be challenged in law, as any law could be but the likelihood is that will be by somebody who is in violation of the law.  The difficulty is that very often if somebody starts with disciplining a child by a tap or a slap when that is not effective it is escalated.  We see too many cases of this.  We need to send a very clear message that violence against children is unacceptable.  I am also very conscious when people talk to me on this issue that this is not about judging parents.  I do not in any way want my words tonight to be about judging parents.  Sometimes I am asked, &quot;Surely it is acceptable if a child is about to run across the road?&quot;  If a child is about to run across the road surely the parent grabs the child to protect him or her, and does not slap or hit the child.  There is no reason to use violence against the child.<\/p><p>There are situations, I can see all too often, when children misbehave.  One of my pet peeves at the moment is the carousel queueing systems in shops that have sweets all at the eye level of children.  The adults are able to look around the shop while queueing but the children are being bombarded with sweets and naturally want to take these and the parent is trying to ensure the child behaves.  In that situation it is important to support the parent and I have complained to the shopkeepers, saying I find it unacceptable that they put parents in this situation by having sweets at the children&rsquo;s eye level.  I am not trying to judge the parent because the commercial sector has created a very difficult situation for that parent.  We should all always work to help the parents in that important, critical role.<\/p><p>I welcome what the Minister has said here tonight.  I believe that children are rights holders, as the people of Ireland do and they need to be equal before the law.  I am not precious about whether this is my amendment or a Government amendment.  If there is better wording to ensure we can do it right, I want to try to see that we can bring this into law.  I agree with what has been said about doing it on the eve of 2016.  Now is the time we need to do it, it is well overdue.  I hope we will stand here next week in a position to accept an amendment that Ireland will at last repeal the defence of reasonable chastisement.  The very idea that we could wait to have it tested in the courts, and let it remain in our common law, horrifies me when I have read some of the definitions.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for his words tonight and wish <i>bon courage<\/i>to him and his officials.  I am here to help if there is anything I can do to ensure we will all be in the position that we wish to be next week.  I will push this to a vote if the Government is not in a position to support it because I feel passionately about this.  I have only a few months left here, whenever there is an election.  This issue has been close to my heart for many years.  I have seen too many cases of children where this was acceptable and violence has escalated within the family.  We have to send a clear message, which my colleagues across the aisle in the Seanad tonight have done clearly, saying violence against children is unacceptable in all its forms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Schedule 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Schedule 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Schedule 3 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443015000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#ZZ01100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015092300002#ZZ01200","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1443015000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
