IDA Ireland competes globally for high quality mobile foreign direct investment (FDI).  There are now a growing number of global locations that are competing for mobile investments including Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe on the basis of low costs but also future market potential.  The effect on Ireland now is that we are competing for a bigger pool of investment but against an increased number of potential locations with attractive product offerings.   <\/p><p>  Cost competitiveness is a key factor particularly related to property and construction costs, energy costs, wages and salaries, local authority charges and services where competition may be limited.  Continued flexibility in responding to changes in both local and international economic conditions is essential. <\/p><p>  The report of the National Competitiveness Council &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2014 Report&rdquo;, which was launched just two weeks ago shows that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last number of years making Irish firms more competitive internationally and thereby making Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations.  However, the Report also finds that, despite these improvements, Ireland is still a high cost location for a number of key business inputs.<\/p><p>  Taking labour costs as an example, labour costs are rising again following a number of years decline.  Although growth in labour costs is now below the Euro area average, gross earnings are the 8th highest in the Euro area while net wages are the 6th  highest.<\/p><p>  The importance of wage competitiveness in future economic development is illustrated by the status of the Manufacturing Sector in Ireland.  In light of the serious decline in employment in that sector over recent years, with 50,000 jobs having been lost in the decade to 2010, I arranged for Forf&aacute;s to undertake an in-depth study of Manufacturing in Ireland and I launched that Strategy early last year.  A very wide range of issues and solutions were identified and analysed, including an assessment of various cost competitiveness factors for the sector.  The study found that average pay levels in Ireland were higher than those in Germany and the UK and that hourly labour costs for Manufacturing were almost 50% more expensive here than in the UK.  Further recent research shows that there has been a decline in labour costs in the years since 2009 but this trend is now being reversed with recent growth over the last year or so.  Our Manufacturing Strategy has set an ambitious target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in this sector by 2016 but we need to be mindful of the significant impact that our labour cost competitiveness will have in achieving this target.<\/p><p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years, we must continue to do more, to ensure that these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover and that we continue to address the structural imbalances which had built up over the lifetime of the previous Government.  Ireland&rsquo;s continued success in attracting foreign direct investment requires a clear focus on improving and enhancing the national competitive environment, easing the impediments to business investment and encouraging job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland Expenditure","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[17471\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the moneys spent by Enterprise Ireland and other such agencies justify the level of jobs created.","asker":"1015","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>I believe the Agencies under the aegis of my Department, Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland and the CEB network, are performing very well in a challenging environment.  They are driving a vital transition from an economy founded on property to one built on enterprise, exports and innovation.  Their impact is measured by the gross job creation in enterprises supported by them, the net job movements across their portfolio as well as numerous agency specific key performance indicators which are regularly published.  I am encouraged by the progress across almost all of these indicators at a time of declining staff in these Agencies.  <\/p><p>  As part of our overall strategy to have 100,000 people at work by 2016, under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the new Local Enterprise Offices, which from today will replace the CEB network, have been tasked with supporting a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014.  Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 new fulltime permanent jobs in 2014.  IDA Ireland will also target 13,000 new gross jobs in 2014 and work to win another 155 new FDI investment projects, with 20% of those from growth markets.  In addition, a further 10,000 jobs (6,000 direct and 4,000 indirect) will be created over a five-year period through the recruitment of extra staff for IDA overseas.  <\/p><p>  In the past year, overall employment increased by 3.3% in year to Q4 2013. 2013 was the first year where every region demonstrated employment growth and there has been an increase of more than 1,200 jobs per week in the private sector compared to more than 1,600 per week being lost between 2008 and 2010.  <\/p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey 2013 shows employment in Enterprise Development agency-assisted companies at 303,155, an increase of 8,579 jobs in total permanent full-time employment. There was also an increase in part-time employment of 3,827 jobs to 46,167 in the same year.  This continues the trend in positive employment growth since 2011.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland client companies are key contributors to the Irish economy and in 2012, spent &euro;18.9bn on wages, services and materials sourced in Ireland.  The Agency&rsquo;s clients are vital components of the supply chains of many sectors and provide sub-supply opportunities for local businesses.  For example, client companies in the Agri-Food sector process the produce of approximately 140,000 family farms annually. This impacts positively on local business by creating new opportunities for sub-supply, distribution, professional services, local domestic services etc. as part of the multiplier factor. <\/p><p>  In 2012, IDA Ireland client companies also had a significant impact on the Irish economy, accounting for: &euro;120.8bn of exports; &euro;2.8bn of corporation tax; &euro;1.3bn expenditure on R&amp;amp;D, and &euro;20.8bn spend in the Irish economy comprising &euro;8bn on payroll, &euro;2.4bn on Irish materials, and &euro;10.4bn on Irish services.<\/p><p>  The total value of grants paid by Agencies of my Department in the years 2011-2013 amounted to &euro;641m.  This comprises &euro;268m by IDA, &euro;313m by Enterprise Ireland, &euro;42m by the CEBs and &euro;18m by Intertrade Ireland. <\/p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact (ABSEI), which covers the period 2003&ndash;2012, shows that client companies of the Enterprise Development agencies reported a rise in sales and exports in 2012.  Direct expenditure in the Irish economy in terms of payroll and purchases of Irish materials and services produced in Ireland increased by 3.8% to approximately &euro;40.8bn in 2012.  The results of this most recent survey show that the enterprise agency client companies continue to make a significant contribution to the Irish economy.  Data for the most recent full year available, 2012, show that it was a successful year overall for enterprise agency client companies with increases in all the main economic indicators.  Sales increased by 4.4%, exports by 5.1%, value added by 3.6% and direct expenditure to the economy increased by 3.8%. <\/p><p>  These figures demonstrate the significant and positive contribution that both indigenous exporting companies and foreign-owned companies are making to the growth of the Irish economy.  Considering that they have been achieved in the teeth of a serious recession, this news is particularly encouraging.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[17307\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if consideration will be given to the development of asset inventories and matrices for towns across the country as a support and marketing tool to encourage inward investment into regional towns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>The 2014 Government Action Plan for Jobs recognises that Regions that support strong and dynamic enterprises are crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s return to overall economic growth.

However, this additional information is not scored and in some cases may not be considered by the evaluators, if they feel that the body of the application provides sufficient information to make an informed judgement on the application.<\/p><p>The evaluation of applications involves a two-stage process with all applications thoroughly evaluated and then scored by EI Development Advisors and external assessors.  The external assessors are professionals who are required to have experience of technology start-ups and also relevant sectoral expertise.  The assessors are appointed on the basis of an open call for tender and the tender remains open for applications at . <\/p><p>Each application under the CSF is evaluated and scored on the following basis:-<table><tr><th><b>Evaluation Criteria<\/b><\/th><th><b>Weighting<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Company and Promoter Profile<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Product\/Service &amp;amp; Market Opportunity<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Execution of the Business Plan<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Product\/Service Innovation<\/td><td>15%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ability to deliver key Commercial &amp;amp; Technica<\/td><td>10%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Milestones over the coming 12 months<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Depending on the number of applications per call up to 30 of the highest scoring projects proceed to the second stage of evaluation which involves a live &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; and an interrogation by a panel that includes experienced entrepreneurs and Enterprise Ireland managers. The evaluation panel scores the applicant&rsquo;s performance based on responses to the following, equally weighted, questions:-<\/p><p>- What specific need does your product\/service address? Why would someone be &quot;compelled&quot; to purchase your offering?<\/p><p>- What is it about you and\/or your management team that makes you capable of executing on this business plan?<\/p><p>- What would be the impact of &euro;50K on the execution of this business plan?<\/p><p>Depending on the number of applications on a given call up to 15 of the highest scoring projects from this stage are each offered a &euro;50,000 investment from Enterprise Ireland for a 10% ordinary equity shareholding in the business. <\/p><p>In general Enterprise Ireland does not provide applicants with details of their projects&rsquo; scores, however, applicants are provided with an indication as to a project&rsquo;s comparative ranking and quartile placing. Enterprise Ireland also offers feedback to all unsuccessful applicants to ensure that they can have a clear understanding of why a project was unsuccessful and also direct applicants to other appropriate supports.  These features of the process provide applicants with a level of feedback which may allow them enhance their bids in further calls under the CSF or to avail of other business supports.<\/p><p>Since the launch of the CSF Enterprise Ireland has received only a small number of queries from unsuccessful applicants relating to the evaluation process or its transparency.  Enterprise Ireland is, of course, always available to engage with applicants under the CSF to discuss any aspect of their application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[17479\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there has been any engagement between his Department and the housing section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in view of the concerns of the negative impact that the lack of availability of suitable housing in a number of locations, such as County Galway, may have on the ability to attract new companies from overseas and also to enable the expansion of existing indigenous and multi-national companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As of 4th April 2014 the CGS has eighty-six live facilities resulting in &euro;11.6m being sanctioned through the scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 446 new jobs being created and 296 jobs being maintained. <\/p><p>  To avail of the SME Credit Guarantee, a borrower pays a 2% annual premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium is collected annually or quarterly in advance throughout the three year life of the guarantee based on the annual contracted principal balance. This is to comply with EU State Aid requirements.<\/p><p>  The Scheme is subsidised by the Government to facilitate additional transactions that would not otherwise have taken place. The availability of the guarantee makes the difference between the borrower not being able to obtain a loan and obtaining the loan. <\/p><p>  The State Aid Regulations provide two alternative approaches to premium pricing in respect of loan guarantees, with guarantees able to be priced individually or on scheme-wide basis. For simplicity the latter alternative was recommended and chosen. <\/p><p>  Recognising the current situation of the SME lending market in Ireland, it is difficult to justify making the case for a Premium Rate any lower than 2% and hence the Oireachtas decided to apply that rate.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently working on changes that can to be made to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and the contents of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme, on foot of the independent review which I commissioned last year to make the Scheme more attractive and user friendly to business.

However it is incorrect to assume that a lack of investment in the region is now a significant factor.  <\/p><p>Over recent years there has been a wide range of significant investment in the South East region.  This includes the provision of major road infrastructure, with the completion of the M9 motorway, the N25 Waterford city By-pass and the new Suir river crossing. Other significant items include additional water and waste water treatment capacity, provision of extensive broadband, major urban renewal works in Waterford city, extra facilities for Bellview Port and major educational investment, with Waterford Institute of Technology alone having invested &euro;150m over the last 10 years in capital projects. Many other smaller scale investments to enhance facilities and capacity have also been carried out in the region.<\/p><p>Following the closure of the <i>Talk Talk<\/i>Call Centre, in 2011, I commissioned Forf&aacute;s to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the region - the South<i>East Region Employment Action Plan<\/i>.  To pursue implementation of the Action Plan, I initiated the <i>South East Forum,<\/i>comprising the State agencies and other bodies, working together to maximise benefits for the region.  I have visited the region several times since taking office and I chaired meetings of the Forum in Waterford City, where I spoke to many of the key stakeholders and learned at first hand of the many challenges facing its economic development. <\/p><p>I am very pleased that the two main Development Agencies have achieved notable successes over the last few years. Enterprise Ireland (EI) has worked closely with the new EISTECH Call Centre, which now employs 500 staff in Waterford and 250 staff in Wexford.  By this Summer the company have stated that they expect these numbers to have risen to 600 in Waterford and 350 in Wexford, as they secure new contracts.  EI has also supported a major investment by Glanbia in Belview on the Kilkenny-Waterford border, which will provide 1,600 direct and indirect jobs, as well as an additional 450 jobs created during the construction phase.  In addition, EI has supported new job creation by Dawn Meats in Waterford and Danone Baby Nutrition in Wexford.<\/p><p>In relation to the work of IDA Ireland, that Agency had two notable successes last year In February 2013, <i>Sanofi<\/i>announced plans to invest &euro;44m in Genzyme&rsquo;s biotechnology campus in Waterford.  This investment will increase the site&rsquo;s diversity of products and comes on top of a &euro;150m investment a little more than a year previously.  The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company&rsquo;s latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site&rsquo;s value to the company.  In March 2013, <i>Nypro Healthcare<\/i>announced plans to establish an additional state of the art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 new high quality jobs in the coming years.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in order to improve the offering in the Region to win new business, IDA Ireland has signed contracts for the construction of an advanced manufacturing facility in Waterford.  This facility, which will be 2,348 sq metres in area, will be located in the IDA Technology Park at Butlerstown and will be completed by year end.<\/p><p>In relation to site visits by prospective foreign companies, that Agency arranged a total of 107 site visits to the South East region over the last five years. <\/p><p>In addition, the local County Enterprise Boards have been very active in developing micro-enterprises and have created a significant number of jobs over recent years. <\/p><p>Regarding actual unemployment levels, it is very satisfying that significant progress has been made.

While the region still has the highest unemployment rate in the State, the gap between this rate and the national average is narrowing.  <\/p><p>All the key State players have been actively pursuing initiatives to facilitate development and job creation in the South East region, and with continued co-operation and collaboration, it is hoped that real benefits will continue to be achieved for the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Targets","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[17472\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500054#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he expects to achieve targets in respect of job retention and job creation in the current year; the extent to which job creation targets as predicted by IBEC are likely to be achieved; if he has identified any particular issues likely to impact on performance in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>When the Government published its first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, it set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016 by transforming the operating environment for businesses in Ireland.

During the year a total of 13,367 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies and 164 investments won thereby exceeding the targets set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  Of the 164 investments won, 78 came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time, with 59 expansions and 27 Research, Development and Innovation projects.  R&amp;amp;D capital investment remains very strong and in 2013, IDA Ireland achieved 93% of the target of R&amp;amp;D investments.  This is a strong performance given the general market caution for large capital projects which includes significant R&amp;amp;D activities.  R,D&amp;amp;I remains significantly important to Ireland&rsquo;s FDI landscape embedding existing employment and putting in place the framework for future employment creation.

Exporting can help secure a company&rsquo;s future, safeguard and grow Irish jobs, expose Irish businesses to a whole new world of ideas and see them competing and winning against the best in the world.  The Potential Exporters Division has 10.5 staff (FTE) and provided &euro;2.3m financial support to help Irish Companies break into export markets for the first time in 2013.  <\/p><p>  In addition to working directly with companies to enhance their export capability through the use of the full range of available supports, the PED holds &ldquo;Export Awareness Events&rdquo; and &ldquo;Exploring Exporting Workshops&rdquo; across the regions for new and early exporters to develop the tools and techniques needed to succeed in export markets. Enterprise Ireland (EI) is committed to helping companies strengthen their export readiness and export selling capabilities. EI offers customised training and access to experts, matched to a company&rsquo;s level of export awareness to save time and money and increase their chances of export success.<\/p><p>  The &ldquo;Export Awareness Events&rdquo; are workshops that are run regularly in a number of locations around Ireland and are aimed at companies thinking of exporting for the first time. In 2013, ten Export Awareness Events were held across the regions and a similar number will be held in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Exploring Exporting Workshops are a series of workshops focused on helping first-time exporting companies become export ready.  Topics include:<\/p><p>- conducting market research; <\/p><p>- defining the export value-proposition; <\/p><p>- advising on the processes for exporting and the exportable offer.<\/p><p>  Business mentors are available to work with client companies to identify the issues they need to address to become export ready.  In 2013, eleven &ldquo;Exploring Exporting Workshops&rdquo; were held across the regions and a similar number will be held in 2014.<\/p><p>  The role of the PED continues to evolve to meet the needs of companies and the corresponding market opportunities.  So far this year, EI have initiated a &ldquo;Meet the UK Market Team&rdquo; event to offer companies, making progress in developing their export capability and a market plan, to meet face-to-face with the EI UK market team. This allows these companies to gain insights into market specific opportunities and challenges relating to their business. Three of these events will take place in 2014, in Cork, Dublin and Galway with possible additional events being driven by client demand.<\/p><p>  The new Local Enterprise Office (LEO) network, working seamlessly with EI, will enhance the reach of export capability building and other supports, and bring new opportunities to a wider number of new and existing businesses.  <\/p><p>  My Department continuously monitors the needs of Irish businesses to ensure that policy and programmes reflect their needs.

It also provides for a means of redress where an employee believes that his or her rights under the Act have been infringed. <\/p><p>  Under the Organisation of Working Time Act (OWT) 1997, the maximum average working week is 48 hours averaged over four months.  This means that the average working week of an employee must not be greater than 48 hours over a reference period that does not exceed four months.  This legislation also covers daily and weekly rest period entitlements.  The general provisions of the legislation provide that employees must receive 11 consecutive hours rest in every period of 24 hours.  This means that there must be one 11 consecutive hours break between the time the employee ceases work and commences the next shift.  A maximum of 8 hours working time in a period of 24 hours is permitted when a night worker undertakes night work.  Breaches of these provisions are matters of complaint to a Rights Commissioner. However, for certain categories of employees, including employees involved in the provision of services relating to the treatment or care of persons in a residential institution, hospital or similar, there are exemptions from the rest break provisions and the nightly working hours provisions of the OWT, subject to the legal requirement to provide compensatory rest. These exemptions are provided for in S.I. No. 21\/1998 Organisation of Working Time (General Exemptions) Regulations 1998.<\/p><p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has an inspectorate which is empowered to carry out workplace inspections to ensure compliance with a range of employment rights legislation, including certain provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  One of the sectors which NERA inspects is the health, nursing and childcare sector, which includes private nursing homes. <\/p><p>  Where NERA inspectors come across breaches of employment rights legislation, including the OWT, they will advise the employer to rectify the issue, and will advise the employee of the appropriate means of redress. Breaches of the OWT are primarily a matter for the Rights Commissioner service.  If an employee believes that his or her rights under the Act have been breached, he or she may make a complaint, in the first instance, to a Rights Commissioner.  A Rights Commissioner may award compensation of up to 2 years pay.  NERA&rsquo;s powers to prosecute in respect of breaches of OWT relate to the record keeping provision, and the provision regarding instances where an employee has more than one employer.    <\/p><p>  Further information on the Organisation of Working Time Act and other employment rights, including means of redress, is available from the Workplace Relations Customer Service of NERA.

The Government&rsquo;s overarching aim is to accelerate both the economic and societal return on our public investment in STI. In this context, the implementation of Research Prioritisation, underway since March 2012, is seeing the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas, where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs. <\/p><p>  In line with Research Prioritisation, an IP Protocol was published outlining new structures to encourage more businesses to commercialise R&amp;amp;D by ensuring that they can access the results of state-funded R&amp;amp;D with greater clarity and certainty. A key initiative linked to the IP Protocol is the newly established central Technology Transfer Office located in Enterprise Ireland, which is providing a crucial interface between industry and the research community and is helping to drive a world-class technology transfer system in Ireland, ensuring it is responsive to the needs of both academia and enterprise. Additionally, the remit of Science Foundation Ireland has recently been expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities, further enhancing our job creation potential. <\/p><p>  In 2013, SFI had links to 41% (2,618) of 6,449 jobs (90 company announcements) announced by the IDA in all fields.  In 2013 of 164 foreign direct investments in Ireland, 27 were in Research, Development and Innovation - activities that are central to productivity and new business development in Ireland&rsquo;s multinational sector. Moreover, the recently modified R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit scheme also continues to encourage businesses to invest in research and development. <\/p><p>  We have a well-established reputation in Ireland for having an environment conducive to doing business and to supporting job creation. We have been extremely successful in targeting FDI which has catalysed industrialisation, the expansion of exports and has helped to diversify economic activity.

Export-led growth is essential for a sustainable economic recovery and measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the most recent Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  Actions include consolidating and building critical mass and international reputation in areas that underpin Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base and enhancing fruitful collaborations between enterprises, academia and other public sector bodies to deliver economic and social benefits.

DHR Communications has been contracted since 2010 to manage and administer the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) grants scheme. This involves managing two funding rounds each year, including through national and regional information workshops; managing and administering the application process; organising the judging process and providing detailed feedback to all applicants; processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records; maintaining and updating the SCMF website and managing the SCMF student competition. DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process, which includes a one-year extension my Department intends to take up. As a result costs will remain consistent for 2014.   Following a competitive tendering process, DHR has also been engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities. DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.

Decisions on the services provided by banks to customers are of course operational matters for the management and boards of the banks concerned. The ongoing insecurity and political instability in South Sudan is affecting almost all aspects of normal life in the country and is of serious concern to Ireland and our partners in the European Union. The EU strongly supports the regionally-led peace efforts and has called clearly on all parties to agree an immediate cessation to hostilities and violence.  Given the worsening humanitarian and security situation across many parts of the country the EU has urged all political and military leaders to protect the population and to act in the interests of the South Sudanese people as a whole.    The immediate priority must be to restore stability and respond effectively to the humanitarian needs of the population.   Over one million people have been displaced by the crisis in South Sudan, including more than 800,000 internally displaced persons. Ireland is responding with significant humanitarian support, including direct support to NGOs, Concern, World Vision and MSF for their emergency relief work.

I have requested that officials in my Department make further enquiries about this particular case and also raise the case with partners at EU level in Morocco.  Turning to the broader issues which lie behind these cases, I remain deeply concerned about allegations of human rights abuses in Western Sahara and about conditions of detention for Sahrawi prisoners in Morocco.   The UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment visited a number of prisons, police stations and juvenile centres in Morocco and Western Sahara in September 2012.  In his subsequent report to the Human Rights Council, he concluded that, in the case of Western Sahara, there was a pattern of excessive use of force during demonstrations, including kidnapping and abandonment in the desert, and of torture and ill-treatment by police officers and security personnel of alleged or known supporters of the independence of Western Sahara, both outside and inside detention centres.  He further noted that many individuals had been coerced to confess and sentenced to prison on the basis of such confessions.   He recommended that the Government of Morocco should promptly conduct impartial and independent investigations into allegations of torture, hold perpetrators accountable, provide compensation to victims, reconsider the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians, and further strengthen protection for internationally recognized human rights in the area of detention.  I call on the Moroccan authorities to give full effect to all recommendations contained in the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report.<\/p><p>  Ireland has raised our concerns regarding the situation in Western Sahara with the Moroccan authorities on an ongoing basis, including through the Moroccan Embassy in Dublin and in Geneva at Morocco&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland specifically recommended that independent and impartial inquiries are carried out with respect to all allegations of mistreatment in detention.  <\/p><p>  Ireland would also support more regular and ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in the Western Sahara territory and therefore has supported the inclusion of a broader human rights monitoring mechanism in the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peace-keeping mission in Western Sahara.  It is a matter of regret that the UN Security Council has not been able to agree to this to date. I hope that this matter will be re-considered when the MINURSO mandate, due for renewal at the end of April, is reviewed in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500055#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500055#WRC02550"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[17970\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500055#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding emergency passports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>The Department has put in place arrangements to issue passports at short notice in circumstances where there is a death or family tragedy for an Irish citizen and travel is required.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.  In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.\u00a0 The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services. Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union. Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks. These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels. The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2013 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM). PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland. The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.In response to the Tribunal recommendations I have considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and have decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners - Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders - In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements<b>- <\/b>This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500055#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Laundering","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[18011\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of fuel laundering plants uncovered in the past five years, by county and by year.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[18012\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated capacity of each fuel laundering plant uncovered in the past five years;

On conviction following summary prosecution, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000 and may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, instead of, or in addition to, the fine. For convictions following prosecution on indictment, the fine is an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970. The court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, as an alternative to, or in addition to the fine.<\/p><p>In addition, when a person who is licensed to retail hydrocarbon oils is convicted of an offence of dealing in illicit fuel, a court may also make an order for a temporary prohibition of trade. This order prevents the person convicted from selling or supplying any mineral oil from any premises licensed by that person. Such an order can be for up to 7 days for a first offence and for up to 30 days for a second or subsequent offence.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the courts. Section 130(2) of the 2001 Act permits a trial judge, at his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount mitigated is not greater than 50 per cent of the amount of the fine. <\/p><p>The penalties introduced in the Finance Act 2010 represented a significant increase on those applying previously.

Where the tax life has already ended, unused allowances will be lost on 1 January 2015. \u00a0The Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information regarding the amount invested in the construction of private hospitals in each of the years 2004 to 2012, the latest year for which information is available, as well as the potential Exchequer cost of income tax foregone:\u00a0<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Amount Invested<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>4.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>7.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>25.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>29.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>30.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>30.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>40.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>35.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012*<\/td><td>29.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>232.1<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Provisional<\/p><p>Due to the existence of the restrictions which I have already described as well as the fact that investors may, due to the availability of other deductions or reliefs, not have obtained full relief in all years, it is not possible to say with certainty what these reliefs have cost.

This estimate assumes tax forgone at the higher rate of income tax applying in the relevant years. It should be noted that the cost to the Exchequer does not arise in the year of the expenditure but rather is spread out over the 7 year writing-down period, provided there is sufficient income in those years to absorb the allowances.<\/p><p>The other detailed information which the Deputy has sought in relation to the individuals\/companies involved in specific hospital projects is not available.

Because of the proximity to Christmas, Revenue wrote to property owners in late October last year setting out a wide range of payment options.\u00a0 These options give property owners a substantial amount of control over how and when to pay LPT liabilities.\u00a0 Many people chose to pay before Christmas because that suited their circumstances.\u00a0 The Deputy will also be aware from replies to previous Questions on payment dates as well as the extensive media coverage around this subject that property owners had the option to pay the tax in full by Single Debit Authority on 21 March in any year, thus deferring the payment until well after the Christmas period.<\/p><p>The legislation also makes provision for property owners to pay the tax for any year on a phased basis over the course of the year rather than in a single payment on or before 1 January of each year.\u00a0 \u00a0In practical terms, a due date for payment by 1 January each year ensures that phased payments are spread evenly over the year.\u00a0 This payment option is still available, either by Direct Debit or by deduction for example from salary or pension, although the payment will now be spread over fewer months. It seems to me that property owners fully appreciate the range of payment options that are available and make their own decisions on the option that best suits their circumstances.\u00a0 I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, for example, over 40% of taxpayers elected to pay their 2014 LPT by a phased payment method and a further 30% elected to pay by Single Debit Authority on the 21 March just passed.<\/p><p>Where a person is having difficulty meeting their obligations, Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.\u00a0 Details of the deferral arrangements are set out on the Revenue website at .  I am also advised that property owners were recently given a final opportunity to bring their LPT affairs up to date and avoid interest and penalties. Owners had until 2 April 2014 to file any outstanding Returns and make arrangements to pay their outstanding LPT, including any liability for 2014. \u00a0It is very important at this stage, as the Revenue Commissioners move into their compliance campaign, that property owners make arrangements to pay their 2014 LPT or, claim an exemption from the tax or a deferral, if appropriate, by accessing their LPT record on-line using their Property ID, PIN and PPSN.\u00a0 Where assistance is required to file on-line, or where a person does not have their Property ID or PIN, they should call the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.<\/p><p>While I appreciate the Deputy s comments about the hardship for certain families, I am satisfied that the LPT legislation provides significant flexibility for property owners to choose the timing of their annual payment of LPT and, therefore, I have no plans to amend the legislation in relation to the due date for payment of the tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD02650"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[17439\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500056#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce a levy on bank drafts issued by the various banks in the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>Under the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, a stamp duty liability of &euro;0.50 is chargeable on a \"bill of exchange\" where drawn on an account in the State.

The protocols also provide for regular checks on all aspects of the call recording facilities to ensure that all Data Protection requirements are being adhered to.  This includes the period for which data is retained.<\/p><p>  Call recording only applies to certain areas in Revenue such as high volume call centres.  The protocols require local management to advise all relevant staff if their telephone is included in the call centre\/helpdesk service being recorded and to ensure awareness of call recording protocols.  Revenue telephone services that operate call recording have a pre-recorded message for inbound calls putting customers on notice that their call may be recorded.  For outbound calls the staff member is required to make the recipient of the call aware that call recording is taking place.  I am satisfied that Revenue has appropriate protocols in place for the recording of calls and that such recording is in keeping with good practice and shows their commitment to quality customer service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[17668\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce a mandatory practice for agents of the Revenue sheriff whereby copies of an individual's statutory rights are provided to them when they have equipment or assets seized as is the practice in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time.  Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due.  However, Revenue is also conscious that the difficult economic and financial climate can impact negatively on businesses being timely compliant.  For that reason, Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with it when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through the difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.<\/p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, I am informed by Revenue that Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945.  Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended.  When acting in execution of tax certificates, Sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts.  They are not accountable to Revenue as regards the methods and techniques of enforcement but are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware from previous replies that the Sheriffs have in place a Code of Practice, available from any Sheriff or on Revenue s website, which sets out how they will engage with taxpayers.  The Code, which is designed to provide an opportunity to taxpayers to resolve disputes without the necessity to initiate Court proceedings, sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint to the Sheriff and how it will be handled.  Because the Sheriffs operate independent of Revenue, data is not available to the Commissioners to respond to the Deputy's query in relation to the number of complaints, and the outcome of any such complaints, that were made against the Sheriffs in the last ten years.<\/p><p>  The Code also provides for a Joint Standing Committee (JSC), which includes a representative of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as Chair, a representative of the Revenue Commissioners and \u00a0representatives of the Sheriffs Association \u00a0to undertake a review of a complaint, where the taxpayer remains dissatisfied with the Sheriff s response to his\/her complaint.  Such reviews are undertaken by means of an examination of all relevant documentation and correspondence relating to the taxpayer s complaint and the sheriff s response.  A total of four complaints have been reviewed by the (JSC) since the introduction of the Sheriffs Code of Practice in 2005.  There were a range of issues involved in these four complaints and each taxpayer was notified of the findings of the JSC.  The low numbers of complainants that have sought a review of their complaint by the JSC would suggest that there is not a widespread problem in regard to this issue, particularly in the context of an average of in excess of 30,000 certificates issued annually by Revenue to Sheriffs over the last three years.<\/p><p>  I want to stress at this point that making a complaint under the Code should not in any way be taken as a diminution or a substitution for a taxpayer s common law rights, which are not impacted upon by availing of the process.  In regard to Questions 17669, 17670 and 17671, while the issues raised are primarily for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to answer, I am informed that Sheriffs are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  I am also informed that the Minister has already replied to the Deputy on these issues in previous questions.<\/p><p>  Finally, I have no plans to propose changes in relation to the provision of the Finance Acts governing tax debt collection and enforcement available to Revenue, as I am satisfied that these are appropriate to the safeguarding of the collection of taxes on behalf of the Exchequer.  I am also satisfied that the procedures Revenue has in place with regard to the use of the legislation are appropriate and strike the right balance in terms of fairness between the majority of taxpayers who pay their taxes on a timely basis and those who fail to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03050"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[17697\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the tax implications on a transaction which involves two farmers swapping small parcels of land without any financial compensation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>An exchange of land constitutes a disposal of an asset for capital gains tax purposes.  Each party to the exchange is ordinarily liable to capital gains tax on any chargeable gain in respect of the disposal.  Land which is exchanged for no financial compensation, is treated as if it has been disposed of for its market value on the date of the disposal.  The first &euro;1,270 of chargeable gains in any tax year is exempt from capital gains tax.  Where the gains exceed that amount, capital gains tax will only be charged on the amount in excess of &euro;1,270.  The current rate of capital gains tax is 33%.<\/p><p>  I made provision in Budget 2013 for the following measure designed to assist farmers with consolidation of farm land.  This measure followed on from measures in the previous year's Budget which also supported farm expansion and the transfer of land.  Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013.  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.  The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase.  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase (or the market value of the land exchanged) is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale (or the market value of the other land that is exchanged).<\/p><p>  Where the consideration for the purchase (or the market value of the land exchanged) is less than the consideration for the land that is sold (or the market value of the other land that is exchanged), relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold (or the market value of the other land that is exchanged).<\/p><p>  In summary, provided an exchange of agricultural land takes place in the years 2013 to 2015, each parcel of land is of equal value and Teagasc has certified that the exchange was made for farm restructuring purposes, no capital gains tax will arise.  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land.  A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order.  An instrument giving effect to an exchange of land is liable to stamp duty at the rate of 2% on the value of each of the parcels of land exchanged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Implementation","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[17710\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the implementation\u00a0of increased\u00a0carbon tax on solid fuels\u00a0will lead\u00a0to increases in instances of persons going across the Border to Northern Ireland to buy solid fuels; if the country could be facing a situation of diminishing returns following this measure;\u00a0if he is concerned that the measure will expose more persons to fuel poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[18062\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will give urgent consideration to the issues raised in correspondence in relation to carbon tax on solid fuel products (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to the serious concerns in this sector, particularly in the Border area as trade has been severely affected over the past year, taking in to account that there is no carbon tax on solid fuel in Northern Ireland and also a lower rate of VAT and that this is creating a very difficult trading environment for the solid fuel sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 210 together.<\/p><p>Although Carbon Tax was introduced in Budget 2010 for fossil fuels,\u00a0its application\u00a0 to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  The Department of the Environment undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011 and the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 specify the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provide the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State.<\/p><p>In particular, the Regulations require that all bituminous coal sold and used outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%, which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State.  Compliance with the Regulations is be enforced by local authorities.  A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal.  This provides for a robust mechanism to verify the sulphur content of coal to national standards.<\/p><p>Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of the Regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution under the Air Pollution Act by local authorities charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.  Budget 2013 commenced the application of carbon tax to solid fuels but\u00a0I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012\/2103 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from 1<sup>st<\/sup>May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>from 1<sup>st<\/sup>May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p><p>The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.<\/p><p>While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  \u00a0I am concerned about the claim that fuel traders in Border counties have seen their trade decimated.  I would ask the Solid Trade Fuel Group to contact my officials with verifiable data to support this claim.  However, it should be noted that the provisional yield returned for SFCT from 1st  May 2013 to 31 December 2013 was &euro;7.3 million, ahead of the forecast yield for that period of &euro;6 million.  Accordingly I do not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from 1 May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Eligibility","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[17752\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500057#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a tax demand in respect of a nursing home bill query (details supplied) in Dublin 5; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it acts as the collection agent for the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of outstanding liabilities arising from the Ancillary State Support Scheme.

There are a number of immediate areas of national priority. <\/p><p>  At primary the NCCA is currently working on the development of an integrated language curriculum for infants to 2nd class.  I expect to receive advice on this in the autumn.<\/p><p>  At Junior Cycle I published the Framework for Junior Cycle in October 2012. This document sets out my vision for reform in Junior Cycle. In January this year, having heard the concerns of the partners, I slowed the pace of implementation from that specified in the Framework document. The NCCA is preparing, on a phased basis, specifications in all 21 subjects. English is completed and now the NCCA is concentrating on Science, Business Studies and Irish and will later concentrate on the other subjects. I expect to receive the Junior Cycle Science specification later this year.<\/p><p>  At both primary and post primary I have prioritised literacy and numeracy as key skills for all students. Complementing the Literacy and Numeracy strategy has been the recent implementation of new specifications in maths at junior and senior cycle - known as Project Maths.<\/p><p>  In addition I have also prioritised Politics and Society as a new Leaving Certificate subject and the NCCA is to provide me with advice on this subject. At senior cycle the NCCA has revised senior cycle specifications in Biology, Chemistry and Physics and these have been sent to me in the last week. In addition, the NCCA is developing new specifications in PE and Applied Mathematics and working on Art, Economics, Agricultural Science and Home Economics among others.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to introduce legal studies or media and communications as additional syllabi at senior cycle. However, the new Junior Cycle does give schools the scope to develop short courses. Some short courses will be developed by the NCCA and can be used 'off the shelf' by schools in their junior cycle programme. Schools can also develop their own short courses locally in accordance with guidance provided by the NCCA.<\/p><p>  The NCCA's main remit is to advise me on curriculum and assessment in line with Government policy. Since April 2010, the NCCA has advised me on Senior Cycle curriculum reform for Mathematics, Politics and Society, Irish (oral assessment), Biology, Chemistry, Physics and short courses in Enterprise and in Psychology. At Junior Cycle the NCCA published &quot;Towards a Framework for Junior Cycle&quot; (2011). The Council has also provided a specification for Junior Cycle English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500058#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[17312\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500058#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of curriculum advisers  he has employed to advise on the issue of curriculum reform; their names and job titles; and if they are employees of his Department or the National Council of Curriculum and Assessment.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>I have employed no additional curriculum advisors.

The scheme is designed to assist candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. Within the context of the RACE scheme the term 'special need' applies to candidates who have a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty. Reasonable accommodations are intended to;<\/p><p>(a) to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment and<\/p><p>(b) to ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.<\/p><p>Reasonable accommodations are not intended to compensate for a possible lack of achievement arising from a disability nor to compensate for difficulties arising from a candidate's general intellectual functioning. Applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published framework of principles established by an Expert Advisory Group. The range of accommodations available to candidates with dyslexia include:-<\/p><p>-  The use of special examination centres<\/p><p>-  Provision of readers for candidates who have reading difficulties<\/p><p>-  Provision for scribes, tape-recorders, and the use of computer technology for candidates who have writing difficulties<\/p><p>-  Exemption from the assessment of spelling and grammar in language subjects<\/p><p>You have raised a specific issue in relation to the provision of additional writing time for students with dyslexia sitting Project Maths given the language based format of the examination.<\/p><p>The position is that additional writing time is not an accommodation that can be sanctioned in its own right. Extra time is awarded to students for whom the use of a scribe has been sanctioned as there is a time needed for dictation and otherwise in dealing with the scribe. It is also granted to students who meet the eligibility criteria for the use of a tape recorder or other recording device or a word processor, etc, but who are unable to make use of these aides under examination conditions. For example, a student may be granted the use of a word processor because their writing speed is slow. However, their ability to type may also be impaired. In such a case the student would instead be allowed to avail of additional time (up to 10 minutes per hour) to complete their examination in writing. Additional time may also be approved in the case of a student who because of a visual difficulty has been granted access to modified examination papers.<\/p><p>It is also important to point out that the examinations in many subjects require candidates to be able to read questions with varying amounts of text. The revised syllabi in Mathematics, introduced under the government's Project Maths initiative, have an increased emphasis on developing students' abilities to use mathematics in contexts, to engage in concrete and abstract problem-solving activities, to develop and demonstrate a deeper understanding of mathematics, including the capacity to interpret and explain results. In order to adequately reflect these syllabus intentions, the examinations involve somewhat more reading and writing than the previous examinations, since setting problems in context in a written examination clearly requires text. While the ability to read quickly and accurately is not part of the test domain, the capacity to extract the relevant mathematical meaning from such text is. That is, it is explicitly one of the target skills being tested, in accordance with the syllabus. Despite the somewhat increased reading load, the mathematics examinations on the revised syllabus still involve a modest amount of reading in comparison to many other subjects on the curriculum. Likewise, although candidates in mathematics are now more frequently asked to give a reason or explanation for an answer, the amount of answering in text form required is also still modest in comparison to other subjects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500059#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adult Education","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500059#WRG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[17434\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500059#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding unemployment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>The upskilling of the labour force has been and continues to be a key priority for this Government.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <\/p><p>  However, I understand that the European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract.  For example, the EU Directives state that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment. <\/p><p>  Therefore the use of social clauses in public procurement is limited to instances where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. <\/p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.  Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State. <\/p><p>  The use of a social clause requiring a contractor to recruit a certain percentage of those employed on a public works construction site from the ranks of the long term unemployed is being piloted on a limited number of schools projects under the Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being administered by the National Development Finance Agency on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) last year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.\u00a0<\/p><p>  A framework of contractors has been set up for the Devolved Schools Programme, which consist of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level.  Three contracts were awarded in February off the Devolved Schools Programme.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  A clause has been included in the contract which requires that 10% of the person weeks worked on the contract be undertaken by individuals recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  There is also a requirement for 2.5% of the person weeks on the contract to be undertaken by apprentices.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that such a provision must be managed carefully both to ensure that the requirements set can be met and monitored but also consideration must be given to their impact on a sector that has experienced decline in output since 2008 as it may result in significant displacement of those already in employment.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The contractor's compliance with this clause under the Devolved Schools Programme will be carefully monitored in accordance with the terms set out in the contract.  Once initial evaluations on the performance of the clause have been undertaken any necessary amendments will be tabled at GCCC before they are incorporated into the PPP element of the Stimulus Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500061#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Recommendations","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500061#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[17801\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500061#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the progress the Government has made in implementing the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

estimate<\/td><td>4.025<\/td><td>11.725<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Project Implementation costs consist of technology, project team resources (both internal to the Civil Service and the cost of implementation partners) and facilities costs.\u00a0 The Operational costs for PeoplePoint include staffing costs and overheads such as heating, lighting, licensing, etc. \u00a0My Department is collating a detailed and up-to-date breakdown of the costs incurred to date and will provide these to the Deputy separately. <\/p><p>The 2012 Financial Appraisal that underpinned the decision to proceed with PeoplePoint estimated the implementation costs associated with this project at &euro;26m inclusive of VAT and contingency.\u00a0 The table reflects an overall project implementation cost of &euro;15.94m.\u00a0 The difference arises as there has been no recourse to the use of the 20% contingency which was included in the Financial Appraisal.\u00a0 Also, a 40% increase was applied to all staff costs in the Financial Appraisal to reflect the overheads associated with staff.\u00a0 This is not included in the actual spend as the Project Team costs reflect the actual cost to the Exchequer of staff who are on loan to the project from within the system.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The 2012 Financial Appraisal estimated that there were 865 full time equivalents (FTEs) providing HR and Pensions services to the organisations participating in the project.\u00a0 Of these, it was estimated that 529 FTE were carrying out transactional (or purely administrative) HR and Pensions activities to be delivered in PeoplePoint.\u00a0 There are currently 224 staff working in PeoplePoint operations.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The 2012 Financial Appraisal also estimated that, when PeoplePoint is fully operational and stable in due course, 309 FTEs would remain in HR Units in the participating public service bodies to continue to carry out the balance of HR and Pensions activities that were being carried out when the baseline was set for the Financial Appraisal and were remaining the responsibility of each public service body after the transactional activities within the scope of the project had fully moved to PeoplePoint.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department has been engaged in tracking and reviewing the progress achieved to date in securing reductions in the number of staff providing transactional HR and Pensions services from HR Units to the Civil Service on a tranche by tranche basis with a view to reporting to Government on progress made by Tranche 1 of public service bodies shortly.\u00a0 The estimated reduction in FTEs would only be expected to be achieved once PeoplePoint is stable and fully operational.\u00a0 <\/p><p>It should also be noted that Civil Service staff numbers were not expected to be directly reduced as a result of establishing PeoplePoint. \u00a0It is expected that the staff resources previously engaged in providing the transactional HR and Pension services transferred into PeoplePoint would be available for redeployment into other areas to meet staffing needs arising from other priorities (i.e. there would\u00a0 be lower replacement rates than would otherwise be the case for vacancies arising, for example, from natural attrition such as retirements).\u00a0 In addition, while some HR staff are being redeployed out of HR Units to other areas of their organisations, others are being re-assigned within HR Units to work that is strategic and potentially of higher value to the business of their organisation.\u00a0 This reinvestment in HR is designed to work in tandem with the introduction of shared services to change how HR is delivered in the Civil Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500062#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department

This is a very valuable service in supporting early-stage enquiries and start-up companies.  The DBIC will also advise the promoter in relation to the Funding Authority that would best be appropriate for his\/her business.<\/p><p>The number of persons, companies or projects referred to Dublin BIC by Enterprise Ireland (EI) for assistance with developing investor plans was 58 in 2013.  Figures for 2012 are not readily available and would take time to collate. I will endeavour to have the information required provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The number of persons, companies or projects referred by DBIC to EI is not tracked; however, the numbers are relatively small, simply because the majority of entrepreneurs will also have contacted EI directly.<\/p><p>DBIC as an organisation receives approximately 500 enquiries per year.  Of these, the organisation engages in detail with approximately 60 persons\/companies\/projects per year with a focus on &quot;Investor Ready Business Plan preparation&quot;.  Of the 60, many would have contacted EI directly or may have been referred to Dublin BIC by EI.  Many others would be signposted to their Local Enterprise Office (LEO); to the New Frontiers &amp;amp; Accelerator Programmes, as appropriate.  Some would also be directed to participate in the early stage Enterprise Start 2 Programme operated by DBIC in partnership with EI.  There is not a formal direct referral process in place.<\/p><p>Of the 58 projects referred to DBIC by EI,<\/p><p>-  6 Projects subsequently received Feasibility Grant funding;  2 Companies also received Feasibility funding to attend  Trade Fairs in the United States; <\/p><p>-  10 Companies received Capital Investment following the DBIC assistance. <\/p><p>Evaluation of CSF applications is undertaken by a team of Enterprise Ireland Development Advisors and external assessors.  The external assessors are all professionals who are required to have experience of technology start-ups and also and relevant sectoral expertise.  EI look for two categories of expert; internet, telecoms, <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Software-as-a-Service (<\/font>SaaS), cloud computing and enterprise software or, alternatively, engineering, medical devices and clean-tech.  These assessors are appointed following an open call for tender.  The latest tender for assessors, was advertised publicly on the E-Tenders website in May 2012 and the call is still open.  EI recently appointed five new assessors to the panel, in addition to the existing panel of experts.<\/p><p>The assessors usually contract with Enterprise Ireland through small consultancy firms who may not have more than a couple of employees.  Such companies generally do not have websites, and it is not a requirement that they should have one.

This was primarily the result of relying on economic growth fuelled by a construction sector bubble and unsustainable consumption.  <\/p><p>At its peak in 2007, the construction sector directly employed 276,000 people.  By the end of 2011, the numbers employed in the sector had fallen to 107,000.  Similarly, the numbers employed in the wholesale and retail sectors reduced from 317,800 in 2007, to 271,400 at the end of 2011.  We had also experienced a significant loss in our competitiveness in the period up to 2007.  <\/p><p>In general terms, business decline resulting in job losses often arises due to a combination of issues affecting the long-term viability of a company. Some of the primary reasons for business decline and consequent job losses include:<\/p><p>-  significant decreases in customer or market demand due to the recession in Ireland and in key trading partners;<\/p><p>-  financial difficulties (insolvency, bankruptcy, bad debts, inability to raise finance);<\/p><p>-  increased competition from competitor;<\/p><p>-  loss of key customers;<\/p><p>-  rationalisation\/consolidation\/restructuring of Group structures involving the closure of a company unit.<\/p><p>To support economic recovery, the Government set about transformation on a number of fronts, including fixing the banking systems, reforming the public sector and embedding a jobs agenda right across Government.  The new economic model which we are building is based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  <\/p><p>Through the Action Plan for Jobs process, we have been addressing key factors which can act as obstacles to job creation and retention.  These include issues such as costs of doing business, access to finance, administrative burdens on business, the need to improve company capability, and access to new markets.  We are also building a strong enterprise mix to ensure that Ireland is not overly reliant on a limited number of sectors for future growth.  <\/p><p>While the task has been significant, we are making progress.

Indeed, in 2013 of 164 foreign direct investments in Ireland, 27 were in Research, Development and Innovation, activities that are central to productivity and new business development in Ireland&rsquo;s multinational sector.  Moreover, the recently modified R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit scheme continues to encourage businesses to invest in research and development.<\/p><p>  We have a well-established reputation in Ireland for having an environment conducive to doing business and to supporting job creation.  We have been extremely successful in targeting FDI which has catalysed industrialisation, the expansion of exports and has helped to diversify economic activity.  As a Government, we are accelerating the re-balancing of the economy towards internationally competitive, export-oriented sectors that can generate further employment and earnings, and we are striving to remove any remaining barriers to growth and employment creation in those sectors most capable of strong expansion. <\/p><p>  Export-led growth is essential for a sustainable economic recovery and measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the most recent Action Plan for Jobs 2014, which includes a dedicated section on &lsquo;Research and Innovation to Drive Job Creation&rsquo;.  Actions include consolidating and building critical mass and international reputation in areas that underpin Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base and enhancing fruitful collaborations between enterprises, academia and other public sector bodies to deliver economic and social benefits.  With 2014 being designated as the &ldquo;Year for Jobs&rdquo;, the Action Plan for Jobs this year continue to focus on competitiveness, winning new markets and new investment overseas and building a strong environment where targeted sectors with potential can grow and create new jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500062#WRK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[18082\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500062#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which smaller indigenous companies can avail of assistance by way of support for research and innovation with consequent improved job retention and creation prospects; the extent to which he sees such smaller companies being in a position to avail of such assistance in the current and following years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>Securing Ireland&rsquo;s future economic growth and sustainability requires a vibrant and productive indigenous enterprise sector.  Improvements in these companies&rsquo; innovative capabilities will allow them to grow, increase their exports and substantially improve their levels of employment.

In-company R&amp;amp;D supports via the Enterprise Ireland R&amp;amp;D fund supported over 100 projects valued at over &euro;100,000 each in 2013.  Innovation Vouchers are &euro;5,000 vouchers that mainly support small companies to engage in initial research projects with academic researchers.  In this way experienced researchers can perform the R&amp;amp;D on behalf of small companies while these companies receive a useful commercial output and a first step on the innovation ladder.  Over 500 such projects are completed every year.  Approximately 60 large industry-academic collaborative projects (up to &euro;200,000) known as Innovation Partnerships are supported annually.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland fund industry focused Technology Centres with over 300 member companies at present and the Technology Gateways programme which generates over 200 collaborative research projects completed for industry each year to provide interfaces between the academic research community and companies in Ireland.  Information on all supports for research and development is available on the Enterprise Ireland website &ndash; www.enterprise-Ireland.com.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 emphasises the importance of innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2014 and into the coming years.

As a result the youth unemployment rate had fallen to 24% down from a peak of 33%.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that the both youth unemployment and long-term unemployment remain unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by my Department.<\/p><p>Pathways set a target of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of February this year, over 45,000 of this group had already moved into employment, 13,000 of whom had taken up part-time employment.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work includes a wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment. There follows a table which sets out the level of provision on programmes for 2014, indicating also which programmes are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed.

The Government is currently on target to meet this goal.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Youth Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis.<\/p><p>Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2014, processes and programmes will be progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months.<\/p><p>During 2014 &ndash; 2015 all long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing.<\/p><p>A breakdown of likely activation places available for 2014 is presented in the following table.

A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.

The numbers in receipt of the scheme have been declining in recent years from 12,000 in 2006 to a current figure of some 5,800 which is expected to cost around &euro;3 million in 2014.  The scheme is now closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  <\/p><p>  During 2013, the Department commissioned the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute (INDI) to update their previous research published in 2006 and updated in 2007 on the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets. Pricing for a selection of foods based on branded and own label foods was surveyed in a sample of retail outlets for each diet. These outlets included large stores, large low cost stores, medium sized stores and convenience stores.  <\/p><p>  The research shows that the range of costs associated with a specialised diet is influenced mainly by the shopping location with the lowest costs being the large discount store and the highest cost the convenience store. In general choice was found to be limited in convenience stores with regard to healthier options. The more specialised the diet, for example gluten free, the more the individual is required to frequent the larger stores in order to be able to purchase the necessary foods. The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate of &euro;186 per week. On the basis of this evidence, I decided to discontinue the scheme.<\/p><p>  Existing recipients as at end January 2014 will continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change. This will allow existing customers to adjust to the new arrangements and anticipate how they will be affected by any future change in their circumstances. It also ensures that nobody is immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme.<\/p><p>  In cases of hardship that may present, officials have the legislative power to award a payment under the SWA scheme in cases of exceptional need. Any person experiencing difficulties should contact the officer administering SWA who may be able to provide assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500064#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500064#WRM01250"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[17547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500064#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for the delay in issuing a decision on an oral hearing held on 3 March 2014 for jobseeker's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Department completed a review of the maximum rent limits for rent supplement and revised rent limits came into effect from mid-June June 2013 which will remain in place until 31 December 2014.  The emphasis of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved.  Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the current difficulties facing people in sourcing accommodation, particularly in Dublin, due to the reduced availability of rental properties.  Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to revise or abolish the maximum rent limits at this time.<\/p><p>  The Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in developing an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are currently in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy. These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances of the families involved.<\/p><p>  A top up payment referred to by the Deputy can occur where the applicant declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord. There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread practice of illegal top ups.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, this map will outline exactly the type of broadband is available in County Kerry. <\/p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO03700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Schemes Data","counter":793,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO03750"},{"type":"question","counter":794,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[18055\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of applications which were made under the better energy homes scheme, the better energy communities scheme, the electric vehicle grant scheme, the better energy warmer homes area based programme and the better energy warmer homes scheme in each month of 2011, 2012, 2013 and each month to date in 2014; if he will also indicate on the same table the number of applications which were successful in respect of each month and each scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":795,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Programme.

The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Bod y   (AHB) to acquire ownership of a proper ty with an unsustainable private mortgage which also enabl es the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant   ( AHB-mortgage-to-rent ).    Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgage s   are now unsustainable ,   and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB Mortgage to Rent scheme ( AHB-mortgage-to-rent) on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012. The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions. <\/p><p>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the vo luntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (scellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/p><p>In relation to the application of a maximum property value, in order for a property to be considered under the scheme it must be purchased for less than &euro;220,000 ( per property ) in the Greater Dublin Area and &euro;180,000 ( per property ) in the rest of the country. These limits were determined by a working group which took a ccount of available market data and the current social housing acquisition limits . These limits are considered   to be   reasonable in respect of the income bracket that is targeted by the scheme.<\/p><p>To date, 2,337 cases have been put forward by private lending institutions for application to the AHB-m ortgage-to- r ent scheme.   38 of these cases have agreements completed and the households in question have become , or are in the process of becoming , social housing tenants.

The leasing initiative already facilitates this and has provided capital funds in the form of the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) to AHBs to assist them in leverag ing their own private finance.     The combination of funding under the leasing scheme and existing provisions of the AHB mortgage to rent scheme provide AHB&rsquo;s with sufficient opportunity to acquire properties for social housing purposes. <\/p><p>Further information in relation to Mortgage to Rent Scheme s generally is available on the Housing Agency &rsquo;s website, <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Issues","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO04850"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[17296\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500066#WRO04900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the State is the sole owner of a beach (details supplied) in County Donegal up to the high water mark.","asker":"1071","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>The Foreshore Act 1933 defines foreshore as the bed and shore, below the line of high water of ordinary or medium tides, of the sea and of every tidal river and tidal estuary and of every channel, creek and bay of the sea or of any such river or estuary and the outer limit of the foreshore is to be determined in accordance with section 1A of the Foreshore Act.   <\/p><p>  The State Property Act 1954 vests ownership of the foreshore in the nister for Public Expenditure and Reform on behalf of the State.

The Act provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. It also assigns responsibility for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) .     <\/p><p>Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.   <\/p><p>The CER has considerable economic regulatory experience in the energy sector in relation to price setting mechanisms and customer protection. As part of its water regulatory functions, the CER will undertake a robust analysis of Irish Water&rsquo;s costs and this will include the use of benchmarking as a method of incentivising efficient business operations.  The CER will operate in an open and transparent manner in carrying out its functions and making decisions in relation to the setting of water charges. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and has indicated that it will be carrying out further public consultations this month.  These will include consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties. Further consultations are planned for June in relation to the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().<\/p><p>An Inter- Departmental Working Group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. This includes the examination of issues arising for those with specific medical conditions that require high water usage.

The Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to affordability, medical needs and the free allowance, taking account of the work of this group <\/p><p>The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water.  The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply. The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households. Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER.

Approximately 1 in 5 households are now renting their home in the private sector.   Against this background, the growing evidence of increasing rents, particularly in Dublin, is a cause for concern. The recent publication of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) rent index for the fourth quarter 2013 showed a year-on-year increase in rents of 3.3% nationally. However, this national average figure masks differences by property type and location.     <\/p><p>  Nationally, rents for houses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were 1.6% higher than the same period in 2012 while rents for apartments were 5.2% higher over the same period. In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.4% and for apartments the figure was 8%. It is worth noting however that, on average, rents in Dublin are still 15.5% lower than they were at their peak in the fourth quarter of 2007.   <\/p><p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 prohibits the setting of a rent that is greater than the market rent for a particular tenancy. A difficulty arises when there is market failure and there is evidence of this in the form of a lack of supply of suitable properties, mainly in the bigger cities and especially so in Dublin. In 2006, housing completions in Dublin had risen to 19,470, or around 21% of the national total of 93,419.  In 2013, of the 8,301 housing unit   built nationally, only 1,360 or just over 16% were in Dublin. <\/p><p>  The Government is taking steps to address these challenges in the property and construction sectors. These will include developing an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing relevant improvements in the planning process and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.   <\/p><p>  Resolution of the housing supply situation is a key element in restoring stability to the market. In the meantime , I believe there is scope to explore measures that would protect tenants in the short term from the consequences of market failure.  I have asked the PRTB to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to me with policy recommendations in that regard before the end of June.   <\/p><p>  In doing this, I am conscious of the need to avoid introducing measures that would have adverse consequences on the private rented sector . My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500067#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Recommendations","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500067#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[17801\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500067#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the progress the Government has made in implementing the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":826,"content":"<p>The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, the 2012 Act, which became law in July 2012, significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the sector. <\/p><p>The PRTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes. For a fee of &euro;25, parties to a dispute can apply to the PRTB for adjudication or mediation services.   If either of the parties to the dispute is unhappy with the decision of an adjudicator, they can appeal that decision to the tenancy Tribunal within 21 days of the date of receiving the decision.   Tribunals are heard by a panel of three members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the PRTB.   An adjudication decision that is not appealed to the Tribunal within 21 days will become a binding D etermination Order of the PRTB. In instances of non-compliance , parties can request enforcement of such Order s   through the Courts. <\/p><p>Demand for the PRTB&rsquo;s services has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting the very sizable growth in the private rented sector. At the same time, the moratorium on recruitment and promotion introduced in March 2009 has presented challenges for the delivery of services across the public sector, including at the PRTB. The Board has responded to these challenges by pursuing a programme of outsourcing, shared services and improved ICT systems. <\/p><p>An on-line registration system was launched in November 2010, on-line dispute management services were introduced in 2012 and a programme of shared services has involved electronic tracking of legal documentation and, most recently, the launch in 2013 of a quarterly rent index in association with the Central Statistics Office.   <\/p><p>In addition to these efficiency measures, legislative changes are in train in support of the work of the PRTB. In November 2012 I introduced the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill, currently before the Seanad, which will, <i>inter alia<\/i>, streamline and simplify aspects of the Act to assist the Board in meeting its service obligations. The Government recently approved the drafting of amendments to the Bill which include measures to address long-standing issues such as deposit retention and the non-payment of rent in dispute cases, which are the most common dispute types brought before the Board, accounting for close to 37% of all dispute types in 2012. The Bill will also provide for the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board and will simplify the mediation process.   <\/p><p>I am confident that the Board will continue to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner. My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this and other matters.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500068#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":894,"content":"<p>Question No. 431 answered with Question No. 393.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unfinished Housing Developments","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500068#WRQ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[17831\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500068#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if funding will be approved for an estate (details supplied) under the special development funding scheme for site resolution plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.   <\/p><p>The total number of water meter installations installed as at close of business on 12 April 2014 is approximately 185,500.

The survey is providing information to Irish Water on the properties that can be metered. The intention is that a meter will be installed in any household connected to a public water supply where it is technically feasible to do so. A study commissioned by Irish Water on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections, has been recently submitted to my Department for consideration. Any proposals for the metering of such properties would need to be considered by the Government in the first instance.\u00a0   <\/p><p>As part of th e metering programme, my Department, in conjunction with Irish Water, is currently working on a proposal regarding customer-side leakage, the   i mplementation arrangements for which will have to be worked out with Irish Water.

The Statement announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2013. Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. .<\/p><p>I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.<\/p><p>To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments. Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  <\/p><p>In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587m, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.  With the benefit of the additional capital for new housing construction, I expect the new social housing construction programme for 2014 - 2015 to deliver close to 700 new social and voluntary homes. A special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses is intended to bring 400 homes back into productive use.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. By the end of Quarter 1 2014, some 1,951 units have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing with the overall total delivery of social housing from NAMA sourced units now standing at 684 (completed or contracted) since the process began. Further information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county of units delivered by quarter, is available at the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website: .  I remain committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500069#WRR01350","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":931,"content":"<p>Question No. 447 answered with Question No. 433.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Funding","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500069#WRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[17960\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500069#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the date on which Wicklow County Council will receive 2014 funding for housing adaptation grants, for works completed to date, works in progress and to facilitate priority 1 category cases, terminally ill or mainly dependent on family or carer where alternations-adaptations which would facilitate the discharge from hospital or alleviate hospitalisation in the future, who have already been assessed as having an urgent medical need for housing adaptations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation , which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment.     <\/p><p>Approximately 900 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local l authorities to date and my Department has up to now reimbursed the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis.  The majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in Louth and Monaghan with 490 and 406 sites respectively.  Further diesel laundering facilities have been identified in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Offaly, Meath and Waterford.  Details of the amount provided by my Department since 2008 on a per county basis is set out in the table below. <\/p><p>This is a significant expenditure borne at present by the Environment Fund.   My Department, as part of on-going cooperation with the Northern Ireland authorities on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held recent discussions with Northern Ireland on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-Border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are ongoing.   <\/p><p>The illegal deposition of the waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment.  The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with the potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses.   <\/p><p>I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective.

To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme.

In the current circumstances it is not possible for my Department to continue to provide funding to Justice for the Forgotten.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. <\/p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. <\/p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This is intended to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department. <\/p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. <\/p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<\/p><p>  I should add that under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, an owner or occupier of land is required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that trees, shrubs and hedges on that land are not a hazard or potential hazard for a person using a public road. The section also provides that where a tree, shrub or hedge is a hazard, or obstructs the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve notice on the owner or occupier of the land requiring that action such as the felling, cutting or removal of the tree, hedge or shrub be taken within a stated period.<\/p><p>  In addition, section 58 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 provides that a network operator may, after serving notice on the owner or occupier of the land, lop or cut any tree, shrub which obstructs or interferes with any physical infrastructure of the network operator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[17677\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of total Garda numbers by station, sub-district, district, division, and region broken down by Garda rank from 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise. <\/p><p>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. <\/p><p>Section 116 of the Bill provides that &quot;<i>a legal practitioner shall not, without the prior written agreement of his or her client, deduct or appropriate any amount in respect of legal costs from the amount of any damages or moneys that become payable to the client in respect of legal services that the legal practitioner provided to the client<\/i>&quot;. This mirrors a similar provision found in section 68 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 which relates to contentious matters. It is my understanding that the Law Society's<i>Guide to Good Professional Conduct for Solicitors<\/i>(3rd Ed., 2013) also provides important guidance to solicitors in relation to monies received on behalf of a client.<\/p><p>An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator . The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.<\/p><p>The various new legal cost transparency measures that I have set out will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors and will enable those availing of legal services to identify costs and their basis more clearly, including by way of comparison with other possible legal service providers and in relation to any potential award. I would expect that, along with those other cost-cutting measures being introduced by the Government, the new legal costs regime will help reduce such costs and their impact on clients including where awards may be made under the independent jurisdiction of the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Trafficking","counter":1065,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1066,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[17975\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 455 of 8 April 2014, his views on the State's implementation of these legal obligations in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1067,"content":"<p>The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 created the offence of human trafficking for labour exploitation, including forced labour. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 which came into effect in August 2013, expanded the definition of exploitation to include forcing a person to engage in illegal activities for financial gain. The phenomenon of persons who have been found engaging in illegal activities asserting that they are victims of human trafficking is one that is recognised both domestically and internationally. Where such an assertion is made, or for any other reason a suspicion arises, that such a person may be a victim of human trafficking a full investigation into the potential crime of human trafficking should be carried out in addition to any investigation of the crimes related to the illegal activities. Investigations of this nature can be extremely complex, comprising, as they may do, of the investigation of potentially two separate crimes; where the perpetrator of one crime may be the victim of another. <\/p><p>This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking. Any suspicion of human trafficking that is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the subject of a comprehensive investigation<i>.<\/i>There are in place extremely comprehensive arrangements for the training of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with all issues relating to human trafficking, including situations such as this. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively and vigorously investigates human trafficking for labour exploitation offences, fulfilling an obligation placed on it to do so.  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work closely with organisations such as the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI) who provide their expertise and assistance, arising from their role in supporting victims of human trafficking. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfils its role regarding the investigation of offences, gathering all the evidence which is available.  Having done so, including in cases where human trafficking for labour exploitation is suspected, a file is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for directions as to whether charges should be preferred or not.  <\/p><p>The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of her functions. Chapter 4 of the DPP&rsquo;s Guidelines for Prosecutors specifically refers to victims of human trafficking, at Section 4.7, where it states: &ldquo;In a case in which there is credible information that a suspect is also a crime victim, the prosecutor should consider whether the public interest is served by a prosecution of the suspect&quot;. The Guidelines state that a prosecution should be initiated or continued, subject to the available evidence disclosing a <i>prima facie<\/i>case, if it is in the public interest, and not otherwise.  There are many factors which may have to be considered in deciding whether a prosecution is in the public interest.  One of those factors that could be considered is whether or not an offence was committed as a direct result of a person being trafficked and the Director of Public Prosecutions may, if she considers it is in the public interest, choose not to prosecute them for offences they have committed as a result of them being trafficked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1068,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1069,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[17981\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500071#WRT03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the procedure to be followed in order to obtain Irish visas for the children of an Irish citizen (details supplied) in County Westmeath who are anxious to comply with all necessary regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1070,"content":"<p>The Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification, which I published on 31 December 2013, is a comprehensive statement of Irish national immigration policy in the area of family reunification.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995. <\/p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p> The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by PDF members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association's claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the PDF.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks. <\/p><p>  Depending on an Enlisted Personnel's date of entry there are variations regarding periods of service, retirement ages and benefits, details of which are set out below.  <\/p><p>- A person who enlisted in the PDF, as a General Service Recruit, before 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of sixty years. <\/p><p>- A person who enlisted in the PDF on or after 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years in the rank of Sergeant and up to the age of fifty-six in all higher ranks.<\/p><p>- Enlisted personnel, in the rank of Corporal or Private, who enlisted after 1 January 1994, may not serve beyond twenty-one years service. <\/p><p>  Enlisted personnel who joined the PDF before April 2004 &ndash; including the current cohort recruited since January 1994 &ndash; have pension scheme terms that are regarded as among the most advantageous available in the Public Service generally.  They are subject to the same pension scheme terms as their pre-January 1994 enlisted counterparts.  However, as outlined above, they have different upper service limits depending on rank at discharge date.  Their pension and gratuity are payable immediately on discharge after relatively short periods of service, and regardless of age.  Their minimum qualifying service is 21 years for immediate pension and gratuity. Maximum retirement benefits under these legacy pre-April 2004 pension schemes are payable after 31 years&rsquo; qualifying service. <\/p><p>  For those who joined the PDF on or after 1 April 2004 and before 1 January 2013, their pension arrangements are more in line with other Public Service pension schemes, e.g. benefits are based on total pensionable service and pensionable pay at retirement date.  They have a 'minimum pension age' of 50, which means that pension and gratuity is not normally payable immediately on discharge unless the person serves to age 50.  Where leaving before age 50, benefits are not payable immediately but are 'preserved' and payable from age 60.  <\/p><p>  For those joining the PDF from 1 January 2013 onwards, the new Public Service Single Pension Scheme applies.  Retirement benefits under this Single Scheme are based on 'career average earnings' rather than on 'final salary'.  For PDF personnel, their minimum pension age is 50 as already applies to those who joined since 1 April 2004.  Where leaving the PDF before age 50, retirement benefits under the Single Scheme will be preserved and generally payable in line with, and linked to, future Social Welfare State Pension age (66 rising to age 68).  Where compulsory retirement\/discharge from the PDF (other than on medical grounds) is before the minimum pension age of 50 on Human Resource policy grounds, preserved benefits will, exceptionally, be payable from age 60.  <\/p><p>  The position in relation to promotional opportunities for enlisted personnel is that they are promoted to fill rank vacancies in the establishment as provided for in the Defence Force Regulation (CS4) which outlines the numerical establishments and ranks of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  In the five years 2009 to 2013 inclusive, a total of 1,239 enlisted personnel were promoted to higher Non Commissioned rank.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500072#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Commemorations","counter":1094,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500072#WRU01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[17680\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500072#WRU01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he has responded to the issues raised in a recent correspondence, details supplied, in relation to the 1916 Commemoration in Arbour Hill; if he will outline changes made by his Department in relation to the way the commemoration is carried out since he took office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This process enabled my Department to update its records as appropriate and use this information to prioritise reserved seating for those who are a direct descendant of the leaders of the 1916 Rising and who are interred in Arbour Hill.  <\/p><p>  The arrangements for the procession that departs the Church for the graveside is a matter of protocol whereby the President, the Taoiseach, members of Government and the Council of State are invited to leave the Church first followed by the relatives who are direct descendants of the leaders.  Additional stewarding was provided in the Church to manage this.  In addition, a reserved area was provided for the relatives at the graveside.  These measures were put in place to ensure that the relatives are looked after in a sensitive manner both in the Church and at the graveside.<\/p><p>  The Military ceremonial element was removed from the Church on the basis that it is no longer considered appropriate that Military personnel would be requested to perform such a role in a religious ceremony.

The Department has taken a number of steps over recent year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   <\/p><p>  One such measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs over the last three years, which were distributed each year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.  In 2013 that Farm Safety message was entirely focused on safe slurry handling with the message that &quot;ONE LUNGFUL OF SLURRY GAS CAN KILL&quot; and also included the list of Safe Agitation Guidelines provided by my Department.  <\/p><p>  In November 2012, I launched the pilot Farm Safety Mentor Programme, an initiative by Irish Rural Link with the support of the HSA to enable farmers to become farm safety ambassadors in their own community.  This morning, I launched the DVDs produced as part of the Programme they will now be used by the Farm Safety Mentors and others to help raise awareness of the dangers of slurry gas. <\/p><p>  The HSA also produced an excellent DVD in recent times containing testimonials from individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated and is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. Teagasc and the HSA distributed a leaflet entitled &quot;Safe Slurry handling&quot; at the ploughing championships in September which details the Safe Operating Procedures for the agitation of slurry and details the dangers of slurry gas. <\/p><p>  My Department's specification for bovine livestock units and reinforced tanks (S.123) gives detailed advice in relation to the safe agitation of slurry, and safe design of tanks.<\/p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem of farm safety that impacts, so horrendously, on so many lives.  Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.

Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes such as the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations, including Youth Work Ireland, are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2014, current funding of &euro;49.78m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.<\/p><p>  My Department, along with all government departments, is required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE).  My Department, in determining the annual allocations for youth programmes, while having regard to the CRE, has sought to ensure that, as far as is possible, the focus is maintained on the front line youth services particularly those for the most vulnerable young people. This year, I secured an additional &euro;1m in the 2014 Budget to offset the impact of the CRE on the youth services. As a result the overall reduction in 2014 budgets for the youth services at 3.75 % was significantly less had been indicated in the CRE.<\/p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;124,626 has been allocated for three projects under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme operated by Youth Work Ireland, Galway. Funding of &euro;47,163 has also been allocated in 2014 for a Youth Information Centre in Ballinalsoe. The projects provide a range of quality services for young people in the area including activities such as recreational group work, youth clubs, in-school-anti-bullying initiatives, Summer camps, transition from primary to secondary school programmes and programmes to promote confidence and self-esteem in young people.  The allocations provided in 2014 represent a reduction of 3.75%  over the allocation provided in 2013 for the services. <\/p><p>  In addition, I understand that Youth Work Ireland is providing an amount of &euro;65,593 to Youth Work Ireland, Galway in 2014 to support the delivery of youth work services at regional level. This funding is being provided from the annual grant-aid Youth Work Ireland receives from my Department under the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  <\/p><p>  The funding provided under the schemes administered by my Department is intended to support the provision of services to young people by the voluntary youth sector and the  operational arrangements for local services including the assignment of staff  are matters for the organisations themselves.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country and its impact on services such as Youth Work Ireland, Galway.  I, and officials of my Department have met and will continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality and responsive youth services for  young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500074#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Expenditure","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500074#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[17560\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500074#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the average cost of child care in Dublin; the average cost of child care across the State; and the number of child care places in Dublin as a percentage of the number of children.

Eligibility for a medical card is assessed first and, if unsuccessful, there is an automatic assessment for a GP visit card.  If an application is assessed to be ineligible on the basis of means for a medical card\/GP visit card and the application also includes other medical, social or financial details that do not form part of the means assessment, the application will then be considered on discretionary grounds.  This provides for consideration for a grant of a card under the \"undue hardship\" (medical card) and \"unduly burdensome\" (GP visit card) provisions of the medical card scheme of assessment.  Undue hardship can only be ascertained through an assessment of financial means, with the extra discretionary effect where somebody's condition or illness is affecting their financial situation.  The HSE's National Assessment Guidelines provide guidance to a decision maker as to the relevant factors to have regard to, in making an assessment as to whether the undue hardship\/undue burden provisions apply to the circumstances presented on an application.  In particular, the guidelines state that the &lsquo;exercise of discretion by the HSE, in favour of the applicant, should be considered where meeting the costs of services covered by a medical card or a GP visit card compromises the applicant's or his\/her family's ability to meet the essential costs associated with: maintenance of employment; provision of reasonable housing; provision of appropriate nurturing and care for children or dependants; provision of adequate heating, nutrition and clothing, or coping with exceptional personal and financial burdens arising from medical or social circumstances.<\/p><p>  In conducting this assessment, the Guidelines state that the following issues be taken account of on an application: illness or medical circumstances which results in financial hardship; the cost of providing general medical and surgical services; the cost associated with the provision of medical, nursing and dental treatment; the cost of physiotherapy and speech and language therapy; transport cost to hospitals and clinics; addictions such as drink, drugs and gambling; poor money management; social deprivation, including poor home management and the cost of medical aids and appliances.  The HSE will give equal consideration to each of the above factors that present on an application in deciding whether to approve that application for grant of a medical card on grounds of undue hardship\/undue burden.  The decision maker may make appropriate inquires or seek advice from other sources to assist with coming to a decision on undue hardship\/undue burden and these sources may include the Applicant's Doctor(s); the HSE's Medical Officers; the Public Health Nurse; the Community Welfare Officer; Social Worker; Therapy Services and\/or the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500075#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":1318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500076#WRY00075"},{"type":"question","counter":1319,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[17519\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041500076#WRY00100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ehlers-Danlos syndrome will be covered under the treatment abroad scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry in view of the fact that the expertises for the treatment of this rare disease is currently not available in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Government has a plan, with a series of recommendations, under the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has established a steering group to develop an implementation plan for the Strategy working with the National Clinical Programme on Rehabilitation Medicine.  <\/p><p>  In relation to specialist disability support services, the HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to deliver its Disability Services Programme.  The HSE is embarking on a large scale reform programme, which will transform our model of service to a community-based model of person-centred care.  This Government is also committed to a significant strengthening of primary care services.  The HSE has provided additional funding and filled 200 additional primary care team posts including public health nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.<\/p><p>  The White Paper on Universal Health Insurance (UHI), published by Government on 2 April 2014, indicates that under UHI citizens will have access to a package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.

The Commission will be tasked with providing a series of costed options to the Government on the range of services to be included within the UHI standard package of services.  It will provide details on the nature and type of the service including any conditions and targeting that should apply in relation to coverage of services.  It will also advise on the services to be provided within the overall health basket.  The inclusion of nuero-rehabilitation care services in the standard package of UHI will be considered as part of this process.  It is the Government's intention that UHI will be introduced by 2019.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family, which impacts on their social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.

However, the Monitoring Group also reported that the implementation of AVFC to date had been slow and inconsistent and recommended the establishment of National Mental Health Service Directorate, the development of an implementation plan and the development of multidisciplinary community mental health teams.<\/p><p>AVFC contained a commitment that it would be reviewed after 7 years.  It was decided to give priority to the review the Mental Health Act 2001, after which consideration would again be given to reviewing AVFC and establishing independent monitoring arrangements.

This new Division carries operational and financial authority and accountability for all mental services.

Accordingly<i>A Vision for Change <\/i>has been given a renewed focus in this year's Service Plan, where the HSE has specifically committed to develop an implementation plan at the operational level for the last 3 years of its term.  During 2014, the HSE will also develop a Standard Model of Care and will focus on developing a major work stream within the Mental Health Clinical Programme, informed by engagement with internal and external stakeholders.
