Child benefit is paid to around 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2013.  I am very conscious of the requirement to safeguard the Child Benefit budget and, in this regard, my Department has taken a proactive approach to ensuring that it is only paid to eligible families. A control strategy has been adopted and operated by the Department which includes risk assessment, surveys of the levels of fraud and error, scheme specific review policies, data matching initiatives with both external and internal parties and investigation of anonymous reports. These control tools ensure that review activity is targeted in the most effective manner and the results are monitored.<\/p><p>  One of the main features of the child benefit control programme is the issue of continuing eligibility certificates to customers.  Another key measure, for customers who are paid at their local post office, is the monthly check carried out where the customer must certify that they qualify for the payment. The Department has also begun the phased roll out of the Public Service Card which features photographic identification of the customer.

The Department is committed to developing and implementing a case management approach, across the full range of its services, with a focus on working with the person rather than administering a range of benefits.  In implementing this challenging programme of change, the objective is to ensure that all services provided are co-ordinated and support customers through the development of improved processes and the concentration of staff and resources in integrated units.  Skilled and knowledgeable case managers will work with individuals in need, to ensure that they not only receive the appropriate income supports but are also helped to find a way in which they can participate to the fullest extent possible in their community, economy and workforce.  A case management approach with a focus on the individual, and the development of a tailored plan for each person will produce better outcomes than the traditional transaction focused delivery of scheme services.<\/p><p>  It is in this context that the delivery of Community Welfare Services in Dublin 12 has changed.  The Department is progressing a number of elements to integrate services and to deliver a more efficient and effective service.  Rationalisation and reorganisation in Dublin 12 has occurred over the past 6 months and continues to be under review.  Rent and Mortgage Supplements are now dealt with centrally through a phone and postal service.  An integrated decision making process has been introduced in Bishop&rsquo;s Square Intreo Office, where people applying for primary payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and one parent family payment now no longer need to present to a local Community Welfare Officer for an interim payment. <\/p><p>The remainder of the Community Welfare Service for Dublin 12 is now being delivered through the formation of a Hub (team based approach).  This Hub was to be permanently located in Parnell Road Health Centre but preparatory works uncovered a number of structural flaws in the building.  It therefore became necessary to move this service to Castle Street in order to ensure continuity of service.  Cashel Road Health Centre had already been designated by the Health Service Executive for closure.   <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these changes the full range of Community Welfare Services continues to be delivered to Dublin 12.  It also remains the intention of the Department to return this service in some form locally to Dublin 12 and options are being explored in order to facilitate this.  The service offered from Castle Street includes public opening hours as follows: Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 2.15pm-3.30pm, and Friday 2.15pm-3.00pm.  An outreach clinic by appointment is operating from Dublin City Council offices in Crumlin Village.  These services are also supplemented by home visits and by the phone and postal service.  The staff and service will be operated in a flexible manner so as to accommodate people experiencing difficulties in accessing Castle Street whether this is for mobility reasons or other personal circumstance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800044#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[50788\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which adequate F&Aacute;S, JobBridge, retraining or up-skilling courses remain available to her Department with particular reference to the need to address the issues of long-term and youth unemployment; the numbers currently seeking to avail of such courses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2013 strategy prioritises the allocation of available resources to the long-term unemployed and to the young unemployed.

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 10,500 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  The Government has provided &euro;41.8 million for the scheme in 2013. The Government wants to provide an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their home but, where people have a genuine difficulty in meeting their financial commitments, they will have a framework to address and resolve that difficulty in an appropriate and fair way having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:<\/p><p>- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers. <\/p><p>- A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent). <\/p><p>- Comprehensive advice to borrowers. <\/p><p>- Personal Insolvency Reform. <\/p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement scheme is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient. <\/p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014.  Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over the next four year period.  However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme. <\/p><p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the MARP.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under this process.  Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case.  These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. <\/p><p>  Budget 2012 provided an amendment to the scheme that from mid June 2012 mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. The numbers on the scheme has continued to reduce since the introduction of this condition which indicates that the MARP process has succeeded in addressing customers&rsquo; short term financial difficulties. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties following the discontinuance of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":25,"content":"<p>Question No. 16 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Poverty Strategy","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[50828\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she is concerned by recent reports of food shortages from charities in Dublin; if she is concerned by rising food poverty here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>Food poverty refers to an inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet due to issues of affordability of, and access to, food, and that has related impacts on health and social participation.

In recent years, there is specific focus on food poverty as a policy issue for two reasons: the structural constraints facing households in accessing food; and the links between food and nutrition and health problems, such as obesity, cancer.<\/p><p>  The World Health Organisation <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">last month published the <\/font>Review of social determinants and the health divide in the WHO European Region: final report, which states that &ldquo;Social protection policies are critically important in shielding populations from the health effects of poverty and financial insecurity&rdquo;.

In 2011, using the CSO SILC definition for people with a disability, the rate of consistent poverty for this group was 6.9 per cent, which was the same as the rate for the total population.

Thus, if people are facing higher costs due to disability, the impact of these costs will be captured through the basic deprivation measure due to the inability to afford basic necessities.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the Department published a <i>Social Portrait of People with Disabilities<\/i>, as one of the lifecycle groups identified in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016<\/i> (NAPinclusion). This report works from a model that understands disability in terms of how the individual interacts with their physical and social environment. The impact of a disability is therefore mediated by the resources people have, the services they can access, the environment in which they live and the attitudes they encounter. The national poverty target and high level goals pertaining to income support, employment and access to services in NAPinclusion are relevant to people with disabilities across the life course. <\/p><p>  NAPinclusion has a specific goal in relation to addressing the barriers to employment for people with disabilities. Of particular concern to the Department is how the social welfare system can support and assist people in receipt of disability payments to access the labour market. While as a society we face strong economic and financial challenges, it is important that we continue to address the barriers to the social and economic participation of people with disabilities. In turn, this will enable people with disabilities to make their contribution to national recovery and to underpin future progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800045#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800046#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[50107\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800046#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to expand the back-to-education allowance for all postgraduate courses.

The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.  The Department continues to monitor rent levels throughout the country and officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.

The Finance Bill (No. 2), 2013, currently before the D&aacute;il, provides for the new credit which will have the same value as the current tax credit and will be available to the primary carer of a child.  The Minister for Finance also informed the D&aacute;il during the second stage debate on the current Finance Bill that he will be bringing forward an amendment at the committee stage of that Bill, which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations where the primary carer has no tax liability.<\/p><p>  The current arrangements in relation to the assessment of maintenance payments made to a recipient of one parent family payment are designed to encourage the payment of maintenance.  Where a recipient of one parent family payment is in receipt of maintenance payments, half of the value of these payments is assessed as means and the rate of payment is adjusted accordingly.  In addition, where a recipient has rent or mortgage payments up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week, these costs can be fully offset against any maintenance paid and no reduction occurs in the rate of one-parent family payment where the maintenance received does not exceed housing costs (subject to a maximum of  such costs of &euro;95.23 per week).  Where the maintenance received does exceed this level then any amount over &euro;95.23 per week is assessed at a rate of 50% and deducted from the one-parent family payment.  Accordingly, the impact of the current welfare arrangements means that, in many cases, any reduction or increase in the level of maintenance paid can have no effect or relatively minimal effect on the rate of one parent family payment payable.    <\/p><p>  It is not possible, at this stage, to quantify the number of one parent family payment recipients currently benefiting from maintenance payments whose welfare payment rates may be indirectly affected by any potential behavioural changes consequent on the proposed tax measure and, accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the estimate for that payment in 2014.

A request to change the address was received by Revenue in April 2013 and was updated to the person&rsquo;s tax record.  However, the change did not transfer across to the Property Register due to a data matching error and for that reason the LPT notification issued to the old address. <\/p><p>  Revenue has informed me that the Property Register address has now been amended to reflect the correct address.  Revenue has also informed me that the person&rsquo;s 2014 payment notification details have been input to the record on foot of correspondence from the individual assisting the person in question and no further action is required.  Revenue has confirmed these facts to the individual who is assisting the person in question. <\/p><p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s comments about the LPT Helpline, Revenue has advised me that the introduction of LPT has represented a very great administrative challenge.  For example, Revenue has successfully answered in excess of 750,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 210,000 letters or emails since March 2013. The requirement to provide customer support to such a large volume of taxpayers did lead to some delays, particularly leading up to the peak 2014 paper filing deadline. <\/p><p>  Revenue responded to the delays by ensuring the deployment of significant extra resources to the LPT Helpline, which is operated by an external service provider.  Revenue also deployed additional resources to its internal telephone support service and put contingency plans in place to facilitate the rapid deployment of further resources should they be needed.  At this point there are 310 agents operating the combined Helpline.<\/p><p>  Revenue also extended the paper filing deadline by one week, to 14 November 2013 and extended the opening hours of the LPT Helpline from 9am to 5pm to 8am to 8pm for the peak periods.  Additionally, Revenue commenced a call-back service where people can leave their contact details in preference to queuing for service.  People availing of this service receive a call-back from Revenue off peak period.  These changes have significantly reduced the call waiting times for customers accessing the Helpline, with current waiting times running at approximately between five and nine minutes.  The Deputy mentioned the person was cut-off when waiting for access to LPT Branch; this occurred due to a temporary technical issue on the telephony system which was quickly identified and resolved.<\/p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s stated that e-filing is not practical for some property owners.  Section 36 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a return may be prepared and delivered by a person acting under the authority of the liable person, which is how the specific case referred to by the Deputy was managed.  In addition to the legislative provisions, Revenue has made further arrangements to assist any property owner who may have difficulties meeting their obligations via the online system.  For example, property owners can file and pay via the LPT Helpline (1890 200 255) providing they have their Property ID, PIN and payment details to hand.  People can also contact their local tax office and make an appointment to meet an official who will be more than happy to assist them in meeting their obligations. <\/p><p>  Finally, I am very happy with the initiatives that Revenue has implemented to provide an efficient and user friendly service in regard to the overall administration of LPT and I commend them for the success of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800049#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800049#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[51110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800049#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners will assist a homeowner who wishes to pay local property tax liability for 2013 but the PIN number provided was incorrect for this property and the home owner has contacted the Revenue offices in Limerick and Ennis to try to resolve this, but to no avail.

The parent or person must not be married, civil partner or co-habiting.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>A qualifying child is someone who is under eighteen years of age at the start of the tax year, or if over eighteen years of age, is receiving full time education or is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself.  The value of the tax credit is currently &euro;1,650 per annum.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the qualifying conditions provided for in the legislation are very broad and make it difficult to ensure the proper administration of the One-Parent Family Credit.  For example &ldquo;part of a year&rdquo; is not defined and there can be, in certain cases, multiple claims in respect of the same child by different individuals.  Revenue operates on the basis of a &lsquo;presumption of honesty&rsquo; which is set out in its Customer Service Charter and most applications for tax credits, including the One-Parent Family Tax Credit, are processed based on the information provided by the claimant on the application form. <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that applications will be queried if there is information on Revenue&rsquo;s records that does not entirely support the information provided by the claimant.  In particular, Revenue&rsquo;s real-time risk framework was developed to identify cases where claims for the tax credit should be challenged before they are granted.  Revenue has regularly run nationwide projects specifically to validate One-Parent Family Tax Credit claims and to ensure that the claimants continue to satisfy all the criteria for entitlement to the credit.  For example, one such project in the South West region in recent years yielded over &euro;4 million for the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners have been working collaboratively with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that the Commissioners have the most up-to-date information in relation to the claimant and the qualifying child.  Such information would include whether the claimant is entitled to child benefit in respect of the qualifying child as well as details of the child&rsquo;s date of birth.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) is being replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014. The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The proposed new credit, should the changes be approved by the Oireachtas, will operate differently from the One-Parent Family Credit, such that the credit will be available in the first instance, to the primary carer, that is, the single individual with whom the child resides for the greater part of the year. In addition I have brought forward a Committee Stage Amendment to allow the primary carer to relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it in certain circumstances.

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all moneys within it are fungible. The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances available to the Exchequer at all times. This also helps to provide investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the maturity of debt. For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external and internal shocks. In general terms the overall level of cash reserves maintained depends on the amount of liabilities falling due for payment in the short term and the State&rsquo;s risk appetite in relation to such shocks over the longer term. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.<\/p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages the national debt in order to ensure liquidity for the Exchequer. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of cash and related assets to be maintained take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. <\/p><p>  As Ireland returns to funding itself through the debt markets while still running a large though declining budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU\/IMF programme is paramount. The NTMA plans accordingly to have cash on hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014 and the early part of 2015.  The State earns a return on its cash balances and related assets which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.<\/p><p>  Due to the fungibility of the various cash streams flowing into the Exchequer, it is not possible to provide a precise measure of the total cost of maintaining the cash balances. However, the NTMA has estimated that the difference between the average rate of interest payable on long-term borrowing and the average rate receivable on cash and related assets is 2.7 percentage points in 2013 to date. The inputs to the cost of long-term borrowing include EU\/IMF programme funds and the bond issuance done by the NTMA.<\/p><p>  The NTMA continues to keep the quantum, maturity and timing of market funding under review based on its assessment of what is required to regain full market access and the overall level of cash balances that it is prudent to maintain. It is the intention to run lower cash balances in the coming years and this has been reflected in the Budget 2014 projections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800049#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800050#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[51190\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800050#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will arrange for the Revenue Commissioners to correct a matter regarding the local property tax in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it received no communication from either the person in question or his legal representatives in regard to a change of ownership in respect of the particular property.

The liability date of 1 November 2013, which applies for 2014, is settled and was approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation.  I have responded to Parliamentary Questions on the liability date on several previous occasions.  In reply to Question No. 110 on 27 March last, I specifically stated that where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014. <\/p><p>  I also informed the House in my replies to Questions Nos. 221 (49518\/13) and 223 (49556\/13) on 19 November 2013 that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  <\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at  and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.

","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, in July 2012 sick leave arrangements for all public service employees were the subject of a Labour Court Recommendation relating to the introduction of a reformed Sick Leave Scheme.  The rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave for the public service overall which is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will be available from one year at present (comprising six months at full pay and six months at half pay &ndash; subject to certain conditions) to six months (i.e. three months full pay and three months half pay).  Under the Labour Court recommendation special arrangements were to be put in place, through the development of a Critical Illness Protocol, under which staff with serious illnesses of specified severity might be able to benefit from extended paid sick leave on an exceptional basis.  The finalisation of this protocol was recently the subject of conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission which aimed at securing agreement on it as soon as possible to facilitate the introduction of the new sick leave arrangements from 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The issue of transitional arrangements and specifically how employees who are on sick leave at the time of commencement of the new scheme as well as the approach taken to employees&rsquo; prior sick leave record was addressed by the Labour Court in its recommendations.  It was recommended by the Labour Court that anyone who is on sick leave at the time of the introduction of the new scheme will continue to avail of the current sick leave scheme and will be provided with access to six months full pay and six months half pay (over a four year rolling period) for the duration of that particular illness.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of retrospection it was agreed by the Labour Court that an employee&rsquo;s sick leave records over the last four years will, as is currently the case, be used to determine whether an individual has access to sick pay or not.  In the case of a non-critical illness there will, however, be a reduction in the number of days sick leave absences in the preceding four year period above which there will be no entitlement to paid sick leave &ndash; other than Temporary Rehabilitation Pay - from 365 days to 183 days.  The changes in sick leave arrangements clearly represent a significant change in the terms and conditions of staff.  It was, therefore, decided that the introduction of the scheme should take place in 2014 to provide all public service employees with sufficient advance notice of the sick leave scheme. <\/p><p>  Sick leave statistics in the public service are calculated on the basis of certified and non-certified sick leave.  Statistics for serious illness are not collected on the basis that there is not at the present time a consistent or agreed definition of serious illness.  However, the significant lead in time to introducing changes in the sick leave scheme was intended to provide staff with extended time to understand the impact of the revised scheme on their own circumstances.  The new sick leave arrangements were agreed under the Croke Park Agreement and did not form part of the Haddington Road Agreement.  The parameters of the new sick leave scheme are contained in the Labour Court Recommendation and the scheme will be implemented in accordance with this recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800052#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[51196\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the funding and construction of a new flood relief scheme for a town (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>Under the South West Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study currently being undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in partnership with Cork County Council, Clonakilty was identified as a significant flood risk area for further assessment.

Rebates to employers are also paid from the SIF.<\/p><p>  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to reduce the level of the rebate initially and to remove it in Budget 2013 was the significant cost of rebates in recent years.  Expenditure in this regard was &euro;373.2 million in 2010; &euro;185.3 million in 2011; and &euro;167.4 million in 2012.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF and I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the SIF in order to compensate often profitable companies for the cost of making their employees redundant in Ireland and, in some cases, transferring their employment abroad.  The continuation of the rebate payment was not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The current arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries and it is not proposed to review the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Employment Services","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[50877\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her Department&rsquo;s strategy relating to the advertising of jobs in foreign jurisdictions to jobseekers here; the number of persons that have been targeted by this strategy; if she will provide figures on those who have taken up employment as a result of this strategy; and if she will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>Following the integration of certain F&Aacute;S services within the Department of Social Protection, the Department has assumed responsibility for public employment services in Ireland. This service includes EURES (European Employment Service) which is a European wide network of all the public employment services in the European Union and the European Economic Area.  Under EU regulations, public employment services are obliged to use EURES to advertise employment vacancies throughout Europe and, when requested by another European Public Employment Service, to source applicants for such vacancies.  This is considered an important enabler of the single market for labour in Europe.<\/p><p>  As part of the EURES network the Department informs jobseekers in Ireland of job opportunities in the wider European labour market which may be of interest to them.  At any one time, there are over 1 million vacancies displayed on the EURES website and people are entitled to apply for these jobs as they wish. It is an opportunity for jobseekers in Ireland to seek work in the wider European market. It also provides a system whereby Irish employers can advertise vacancies free of charge throughout Europe in situations where such vacancies cannot be filled by jobseekers in Ireland. A number of large employers have used these services to recruit people with specialist language skills and in so doing have secured the future of their mainly Irish workforce.<\/p><p>  From time to time the Department, via EURES, is also asked to assist State or Public employment Services in countries outside of the EU\/EEA, typically Canada, Australia and the USA, to advertise and fill vacancies. Depending on the nature of the posts to be advertised the Department will respond positively to such requests on a reciprocal basis.  In the past the State and Public Employment Services in these countries facilitated Ireland in advertising vacancies and matching candidates for these vacancies. As part of these reciprocal arrangements the country advertising the posts typically provides assistance in securing employment visas and accommodation for jobseekers. <\/p><p>  To date in 2013, approximately 4,000 letters have issued to jobseekers in respect of jobs in Spain, Norway, France and the UK for a range of positions including English teachers, plumbers, sales &amp;amp; hospitality, mechanics and electricians.  As jobseekers apply for these vacancies through the EURES portal, it is not possible to know how many people applied for and secured employment using the service.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there is no obligation on  unemployed jobseekers in receipt of income supports to apply for overseas vacancies. In notifying jobseekers of such vacancies the Department is simply drawing jobseekers attention to vacancies that exist and that are simultaneously being brought to the attention of jobseekers in other countries.  The Department would be failing in its duties if it did not offer Irish jobseekers an equal opportunity to compete for such vacancies if they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":193,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance Eligibility","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00850"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[51118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800053#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the date on which she will make the back-to-education allowance scheme available to all postgraduate courses.

Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people out of work and covered by social insurance.  If a person does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance.  The Revised Estimates for my Department provides for expenditure on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;3.66 billion in 2013.<\/p><p>  Legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  In most circumstances persons leaving local Government employment at age 65 will claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  It is provided that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will generally be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the full year to age 66 provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions.<\/p><p>  In addition, people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must engage with the Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  From January 2014, these criteria will be eased for people aged 62 and over.

Where no adoption took place, if records exist they may be held by a number of sources including hospitals, GPs, Mother and Baby Homes, religious orders and other sources.  A large number of these files are being transferred to the HSE. <\/p><p>  The HSE provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families.  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the HSE.  Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork; Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary; and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath.  Work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and the HSE is anxious to preserve the integrity of these records.  The HSE has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files, which are of great significance.  <\/p><p>  The HSE also has records that include those for St. Anne&rsquo;s Adoption Society; St Mary&rsquo;s Adoption Society, Kerry; Ard Mhuire, Dunboyne, Co Meath; Limerick Catholic Adoption Society; St Patrick's Mother and Baby Home Navan Road, Dublin; St Louise's Adoption Society Dublin; Dublin Health Authority Board of Assistance; Rotunda Girls Aid Society; the Ossory Kilkenny Adoption Society; St Kevin's and St Johns Adoption Societies.  The HSE is also in negotiation regarding files from Holles Street, St Brigid's, and St Patrick Guild. Furthermore PACT, who are an agency accredited under the Act, have records of various Protestant organisations.  A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations,  is available on the HSE website.<\/p><p>  The HSE Information and Tracing Service recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and has put in place a plan to redistribute records from individual institutions in their entirety, to the various adoption teams around the country,  in a concerted effort to reduce waiting times.  The HSE is in the process of reorganising the information and tracing system to allocate social work resources country wide in a way that will allow for reduced waiting times across the country.  The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland  or the HSE Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The HSE is working to provide a more streamlined  service and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the  Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.  I have no plans to initiate an audit of all files in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children and Family Services","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[51199\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans for improved children's services in the Clondalkin, Dublin 22 area.","asker":"1011","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[51200\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans for improved children's services in the Lucan, County Dublin area.","asker":"1011","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.<\/p><p>  The commitment to improve the quality of early childhood care and education nationally for all children has been a key priority for me since becoming Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy and working on a comprehensive<b><\/b>Pre-School Quality Agenda which aims to improve quality standards in pre-school services in Ireland.  I have identified a number of key areas which I consider to require reform, and legislation to underpin these reforms is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.  This legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level.  Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with and the threat of removal of registration will be available. <\/p><p>  The HSE is currently recruiting a number of pre-school inspectors to strengthen the inspection framework and a further &euro;0.5 million in funding will be allocated in 2014 towards the cost of further increasing staffing levels in the pre-school inspectorate.  I have decided to increase the minimum qualification requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year to Level 6 and to increase the qualification requirement for all other staff working with children in the sector to a minimum qualification at Level 5.  These new requirements will apply from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  During 2014\/2015 I will be implementing a new national training programme for which I have secured additional funding of &euro;3m.  This programme will support the existing childcare workforce in meeting the new qualifications requirement.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear Practice Frameworks, developed to support quality early childhood care and education in Ireland, is an important initiative in the development of quality childcare services. I announced in Budget 2014 the introduction of a new quality support service which will work directly with services to improve quality and support the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and Aistear Curriculum. &euro;2.5 million is being made available for this service in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Children and Young People's Policy Framework is currently being developed by my Department.  The Framework will set out the overall principles, vision and outcomes for children and young people and will guide actions across Government over the period 2014 to 2018.  I expect to circulate the Framework to other Ministers in December. Following approval by Government the Framework will be published early in the New Year for discussion at a Government meeting in January. <\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is one of a number of more detailed strategies under the Children and Young  People's Policy Framework, is currently being developed by my Department. The Strategy, which is expected to be published early next year, will address a range of issues affecting children in the first years of their life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.  <\/p><p>  Significant investment totalling in excess of &euro;260 million is  provided annually by my Department to provide for the free pre-school provision through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, and for support for disadvantage and low come families through the Community Childcare Subvention programme.  The funding also supports the Childcare Education and Training Support  programme which assists Solas trainees and Education and Training Board (ETB) students with the cost of childcare.  I have been successful in maintaining these programmes, despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure, and I am pleased that in the region of 100,000 children in the country benefit each year from these supports.<\/p><p>  This week I also announced that the Clondalkin Blue Skies Initiative has been selected as one of 13 projects to be funded through the Government's new ABC (Area Based Childhood) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00850"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[51285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800064#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding personal files relating to the previous residents of Rath na n&Oacute;g high-support unit in Castleblayney since its closure in October; the steps that have been taken to ensure that all documentation containing information pertaining to the children and young persons has been contained in a secure setting; the posts or positions of officials who have access to these documents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This represents approximately 11.5% of overall health expenditure this year.  The majority of this funding is distributed through non-statutory agencies who deliver over 80% of all disability services. There are in the region of 300 such agencies at present across the country that provide a significant and broad range of services for children and adults with disabilities in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  <\/p><p>  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.

I want insurers to address the base cost of each element of claims which they pay and have made it clear to private health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, ultimately reducing the impact of rising health costs on health insurance premiums for the consumer.  Earlier this year, I appointed  Mr. Pat McLoughlin to prepare an independent report on how best to achieve real cost reductions in the private health insurance market, having full regard to competition law.  I expect to receive an initial report from the Chair very shortly.<\/p><p>  Risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers and I am committed to progressively increasing the extent of this compensation.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, currently progressing through the Oireachtas, sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  Different risk equalisation credits will apply to 'advanced' and 'non-advanced' health insurance policies. There will be no change to the stamp duty payable on lower cost 'non-advanced' health insurance, which will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. The stamp duty for health insurance products providing 'advanced' cover will increase from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the stamp duty, or levy the Deputy refers to is collected from all health insurers and is in respect of the number of lives insured by them, and is not placed on individual policy holders.  The money collected is used to fund RE credits for older people with private health insurance who, if under a risk rated model of insurance, would be charged a higher premium for health insurance than younger people, given their higher risk profile.  Funding the RE credit for older people ensures that everyone is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the stamp duty on to their customers.<\/p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Act, 2013 (No. 31 of 2013) provides for the introduction of a revised private in-patient charge for all private patients in public hospitals, including those accommodated in public beds.  All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are entitled to use a public hospital.  However, some people choose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital.  The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing those services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense.<\/p><p>  From 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase private medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  This will affect some consumers, depending on the cost of the policies that they purchase.  While individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely, it is important that they fully understand the level of cover their policy provides.<\/p><p>  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site, www.hia.ie, has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down the cost of private health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to Universal Health Insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800068#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800068#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[51287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112800068#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to restore dental services at Virginia Health Centre, County Cavan which services a large number of primary schools in that area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>The public health system currently provides a dental service to schoolchildren aged up to 16 years.

There has been a positive\u00a0response to the initiative from airlines so far\u00a0with Ryanair and Aer Lingus Regional both announcing details of new routes and increased services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. The elimination of the air travel tax coupled with the decision to maintain the tourism and hospitality VAT rate at 6% is a clear indication of the Governments support for air travel and Irish tourism generally.<\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland works closely with carriers, airports and agencies to make the case for the introduction of new services or extended capacity. The DAA also has attractive incentive packages available for the introduction of new routes. In Summer 2013, total available seat capacity was +3% higher thaan Summer 2012.
