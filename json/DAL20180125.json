This is essentially responding to a good news story to make sure that when people come home, they make the transition in as positive a way as possible.  The Government is committed to working to facilitate Irish people living abroad who wish to return to live and work in Ireland.  We are working to ensure that moving or returning to Ireland is as easy as possible for them.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the emigrant support programme, provides significant funding and support to organisations, including the Crosscare Migrant Project and Safe Home Ireland, which work with citizens who wish to return to Ireland.  Over the past decade, more than &euro;4 million has been allocated to Irish-based organisations working with returning emigrants and funding for these organisations this year is in line with recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Cannon, chairs the interdepartmental committee, IDC, on the Irish abroad, which works to ensure that the Government works in a joined-up way to realise the objectives of Ireland's diaspora policy.  That includes addressing issues affecting the Irish abroad and those seeking to return.  The role of the Minister of State as chair of the IDC is to raise areas of concern to Irish people abroad with Departments with responsibility for those areas.  Work is continuing in a number of Departments to address practical issues that have been raised by the interdepartmental committee.  To build on the work of the committee in addressing such barriers, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has commissioned an economic report on barriers to return.  The report will be completed in the coming weeks and will inform Government policy and actions on difficulties it finds.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to addressing potential barriers, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is always looking for new and innovative ways to assist Irish people abroad and those returning.  To support returning emigrants in a practical way, the Department has established Back for Business, a mentoring programme for returning emigrants to help them set up business in Ireland and contribute fully to local communities and economies across the country.  This pilot programme is currently under way and will be reviewed on completion.  I know there are some other practical issues regarding driving licences, for example, and we are seeking to come up with solutions to address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500003#A00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister does not mind me saying that the response is pretty vague.

They are rated on the basis that their previous driving experience in places such as Canada is not taken into account and their previous driving record in Ireland, including no-claims bonus, is all set aside.  I am asking the Minister about practical steps being taken by the Department, for example, whether it has met with Insurance Ireland to ask why premia are being loaded for returning emigrants.<\/p>  <p>  Second, most returning emigrants are now told there is a postponement period of 12 months within which they will get no health cover after they return to this country and most of them cannot transfer their health cover to Ireland.  Practical measures are required such as talking to companies such as the VHI.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that he needs to meet the Irish Banking Federation because people applying for a mortgage are now asked by Bank of Ireland, for example, to provide a P60 for the previous year's earnings.

Significant numbers are returning and that is great and fantastic.  I have travelled to a number of our embassies, though not as many as has the Minister in his role.  They are meeting people who are inquiring about what happens when one comes back to Ireland.  How does one get a mortgage?  What is the situation concerning insurance premiums?  They are concerned with all of these things.<\/p>  <p>  There are practical measures open to the Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, could meet the Irish Banking Federation and ask why its members insist on these terms for people who have earnings records in other countries or why they insist on P60s.  The Government could ask Insurance Ireland why its members set aside previous driving records in Ireland and do not take into account driving or claims records in England, Europe, Canada or the United States.

The Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts is fully protected and respected in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has a responsibility to protect the agreement and the gains of the peace process. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners over the past 18 months and more has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU 27 and have been reflected in the EU negotiating guidelines and directives for the Article 50 process.  The guiding principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland were published by the European Commission Article 50 task force in September and form the basis for the EU&rsquo;s engagement with the UK on the shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.  <\/p><p>The negotiations over recent months saw a good political understanding develop on all sides involved in the negotiations of what is required to achieve this objective, which is shared between Ireland, the EU and the UK.  In the joint report of the EU and UK negotiators on 8 December, the UK reiterated its commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement, including the effective operation of the institutions and bodies of the agreement.  The joint report reaffirmed that North-South co-operation is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement and the UK committed to protecting and supporting continued North-South and east-west co-operation across the full range of frameworks of co-operation, including the operation of the North-South bodies.The EU and UK also recognised the birthright of all of the people of Northern Ireland to choose between Irish or British citizenship or to have both and that the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including when they reside in Northern Ireland.  That is complicated and I note the Deputy has raised some issues in this regard previously, including questions on court jurisdictions and so on.  We will have to try to work through those issues. <\/p><p>In regard to the Good Friday Agreement provisions on fundamental rights and equality, the UK committed in the joint report to ensuring that no diminution of rights is caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against discrimination enshrined in EU law.<\/p><p>In regard to peace funding linked to the Agreement, there is also a commitment to continue that into the future. <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In addition, the EU and UK also both committed to honour their commitments to PEACE and INTERREG funding under the current multi-annual financial framework and to examine favourably possibilities for future support.<\/p><p>The phase 2 discussions on the Ireland-specific issues will continue in a distinct strand of the Article 50 negotiations on the detailed arrangements required.

It has been called a \"backstop\" agreement in this State.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty is in the interpretation of protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  The focus seems to be almost exclusively on trade.  What the Government and the Minister need to understand is that the Good Friday Agreement was about more than trade.  Trade was only one small part of it.  It was also about people's social rights, political rights and rights to equality.  A lot of that was underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  I have two questions for the Minister.  Can he commit to citizens in the North continuing to have access to the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice post Brexit?  Furthermore, can he commit to citizens in the North having political representation in the European Parliament, which should also be the right of any Irish citizen and any European citizen?  That will be a test of whether we are truly going to vindicate the rights of Irish citizens and European citizens in the North. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500004#B00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>First, I personally cannot guarantee anything in these negotiations.

I think there is an understanding in the British Government of the importance of providing reassurance to people in Northern Ireland on issues that go beyond economics.<\/p>  <p>   The text that was agreed on 8 December was not solely focused on economics.  It was very strong in regard to citizens' rights, human rights concerns and making sure there was no diminution of rights in the context of fears regarding discrimination.  It is a very strong text on those concerns.  I had a meeting this week with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which met here together in a joint committee.  We spent quite some time talking about concerns that need to be the focus of negotiations in phase 2 on future and transitional arrangements governing the future EU-UK relationship.  I can assure the Deputy that these are issues that are live.  We are aware of the concerns.

I raise them because they are central and important to citizens in the North and because they underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  My point is the Minister is right when he states we need to ensure that Irish citizens who live in the North should continue to enjoy the same rights they currently enjoy as EU citizens.  At present, they have access to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.  The reasonable question asked by those citizens in the North, who are European citizens, is whether they will continue to do so.  At present, they have representation in the European Parliament.  It is reasonable to ask whether they will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of certain demands, it is reasonable for an Irish Government to put these issues on the table.  I heard the Taoiseach today talk about a \"Norway-plus\" solution for Britain, saying that he wanted the best outcome for Britain and the European Union, that is, the closet possible relationship.  What he said is that as there is no solution and no precedent here, anything is on the table.  The same can be said of the North.  We want special status for the North within the European Union.  Why would the Irish Government not take the same approach, whereby everything is on the table and everything is possible?  <\/p><p>If the Minister truly wants to vindicate the rights of citizens in the North and to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and all its parts, then those citizens who live in the North cannot have the rights on one hand yet not be able to exercise and vindicate them in the place they live, which just happens to be the North.  That is a genuine concern of ours.  We will work with the Irish Government and do our best to ensure that we get these type of issues over the line.  I am not looking for absolute outcomes because we cannot guarantee them.  However, we can expect an Irish Government to make not demands but common sense, practical proposals that will impact on citizens living in the North. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500004#B01100","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516877400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I do not want to stop anybody having their say.

It means, essentially, that nothing can be done in the Northern Ireland economy that would lead to future border controls.  I asked three separate Under Secretaries if that was also their agreement.  They would not agree to that: they hedged.  Does the Minister accept that the British Government has a different view as to just how solid and categoric the December agreement is?  Will the Minister expand on Norway-plus?  We all understand what the Norway model is within the European Free Trade Association, EFTA.

On the Common Fisheries Policy, which the Minister knows well from his previous role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the British Ministers reiterated, when we were in London last week, that the UK will be taking back control of its territorial waters.  It will be leaving the Common Fisheries Policy.  This is an existential threat to our fishing industry.  What is the Irish Government doing, specifically in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy?  Is the Government looking to renegotiate the basic formula to give Ireland a fair share if indeed the UK does look to take back its territorial waters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500005#C01800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1516877400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.

The Common Fisheries Policy is really urgent.  It was reiterated to us in Westminster last week that the UK intends taking it.  I was in Greencastle, County Donegal, on Monday talking to people from a fishing co-operative.  There are things we can be doing.  If the UK insists on taking back its territorial waters, we need to open up a conversation about renegotiation back to the position in 1972 and explain how things have fundamentally changed for us.<\/p>  <p>  My position and that of Fianna F&aacute;il on the domestic front is that little is being done but a great deal can be done.  The Government lists websites, access to funds and so on.  However, I have spoken to fishermen, farmers and SME owners throughout the country.  I have asked whether they are being helped in a substantial way in terms of access to credit, relaxation of state-aid rules, feasibility studies for new EU markets, changes to supply chains and pricing strategies.  I have asked them whether they are getting a comprehensive response from the State and its various agencies to help them not only mitigate the risks of Brexit but to actually use it as a nudge to become bigger, better, stronger and trade more.  The answer I have received from people throughout the country from every sector is \"No\".  They acknowledge that there is a website and that there is a new fund available which offers lower-cost credit.  However, they maintain that they are not getting a comprehensive national response.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach responded to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and myself in reply to a parliamentary question confirming that the Brexit Cabinet committee has not met since September.

Deputy Eamon Ryan will receive a copy of my written answer but I wish to take this opportunity to respond to him directly.<\/p>  <p>  I have spent a good deal of time on this issue since moving into this brief.  It is something I am personally interested in.  I have been to Israel and Palestine twice in the space of less than six months.  I have met the Israeli Prime Minister three times and I have met Palestinian leaders more frequently than that.  As recently as last week, I met President Abbas in Brussels.  We have been speaking directly to the US of its ambitions for a new peace initiative.  We have tried to make clear that the EU as a whole, including Ireland, needs to see certain things in that new initiative if we are going to be able to support it.<\/p>  <p>  There is considerable political dialogue and engagement.  I absolutely accept that when someone is looking from the outside in, it looks like this is going backwards rather than forwards.

I do not think now is the right time to do that.  I have explained to all parties why that is the case.  Now is a time for politicians and governments to undertake tough talking in meetings as opposed to isolating themselves by gestures.  Such gestures may be good from a solidarity perspective, but I am unsure whether they would advance the political process.  Ultimately, that is what we need.  If we are clearly getting nowhere with dialogue, obviously we will have to review that in a few months' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500006#D01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1516878000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I would always stand for political engagement, although that can include the use of protest and the European Union changing its position to take a far more critical approach, especially in respect of what the US Government and the Israeli Government are doing.

I have one question in that regard.  Did the Minister hear anything in his talks with President Abbas or others about a fundamental shift towards seeking a one-state rather than a two-state solution?  If citizenship was applied, there would be almost a balance between Arab and others Jewish communities within a combined single state.  During and Oireachtas visit to the Middle East early last year, I heard the view that maybe we need to recalibrate the overall approach because the current system is not working.  The current system seems to suit Israel because those involved in Israel have control, including security control and control of populations in every way.  It is not working for the Palestinian people.

There is a view that a one-state solution would not inspire the kind of hope that many Palestinian communities want and need.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely committed to a two-state solution still.  However, there are many things we need to raise concerns about in the meantime.  The continuation of the expansion of illegal settlements in occupied territory in the West Bank is making a two-state solution more difficult to negotiate.  It is making trust between the parties more difficult to reinforce.  We need to encourage the reconciliation process between Fatah and Hamas to ensure that at some stage in the not-too-distant future the Palestinian Authority can take control and governance, including security control in Gaza.

There was a sense of positivity that they were waiting for a new initiative that the Palestinians would be able to support.

The Deputy cannot expect Irish companies to be fully briefed on all human rights issues either.  It is a responsibility of Government to ensure that our policies are consistent and that we work with the European Union to advocate for the advancement of human rights and to protect vulnerable communities.  We do not always succeed in that.  However, Ireland has been consistent in the EU and the UN in speaking out and backing up our statements with the financing of humanitarian assistance.

This approach is set out in the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, which was published in March of last year.  The embassy network also plays an important role in supporting and deepening trade and investment relationships around the world, by raising Ireland&rsquo;s visibility in markets, proactively addressing market access issues, hosting high-level events in support of Irish business, brokering introductions and offering guidance on local markets and business culture.<\/p><p>Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and through the European Union and the United Nations.

Events to mark the people&rsquo;s vote for the agreement on 22 May are also under development.  I hope to announce more details on the programme in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  All of these events will also be an opportunity to reflect on the peace process, as the Deputy suggested, past and present, to remember the loss of life during the years of conflict and to look back at all that has happened on the journey of peace and reconciliation since then.  This journey is of course an ongoing one and the continued imperative to work to realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement will form an essential part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the 20th anniversary. <\/p>  <p>  We intend to work with all communities and political parties to make sure that the commemorations are respectful and accurate.

I welcome the fact that he intends to hold commemorations and events on our island, in Washington and elsewhere.  We should also press for a significant input from the European Union to mark the achievement.  The EU is not explicitly mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement but it also underpins the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The chair of the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement, the former US Senator George Mitchell, acknowledged the importance of the EU recently.  He said the agreement would not have been possible without the European Union, as our joint membership of the Union and the many bilateral meetings held between British and Irish Ministers and officials every week, often on a daily basis, played a vital role in thawing and improving relationships between both islands.  Those improved relationships led to the peace process and the finalisation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister quite rightly referred to the significant date of 22 May 1998 when, thankfully, for the first time on the island since 1918, those of us who had the opportunity to do so cast a vote.  We were a privileged generation, in that we were the first since 1918 who voted with the people of Northern Ireland on the same question.  The Minister will recall that in our State, 94.39% of the people voted \"Yes\" and in Northern Ireland, 71.12% of the people voted \"Yes\", despite the major unionist party at that time not agreeing to what had been achieved.  There was very little support in campaigning terms from Sinn F&eacute;in for the referendum.  It was a remarkable achievement.<\/p>  <p>  I sincerely hope that the events which will be held will not involve the usual invitation list.  We want to get people involved from society in general in commemorating these events and marking what we achieved and where we came from.  The Minister or his Department might consider involving schools, in particular second and third level institutions, in order to make that generation aware of the progress which has been made and the need to maximise the potential of the agreement from now on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500008#F00800","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1516879200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I know how personally committed Deputy Smith is to the peace process and its maintenance.

If the Deputy has ideas and suggestions we will certainly try to take them on board.<\/p>  <p>  Given my responsibilities, I am very conscious that the most important thing we could do to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement is to get devolved government up and running and functioning again, as well as the institutions which come from that in terms of the North-South Ministerial Council and so on.

Ireland has also provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining that support.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has strong ties with the UAE, and within this relationship we are able to raise our concerns.  My predecessor, Deputy Flanagan, raised concerns about the humanitarian situation in Yemen with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, both during a visit to the UAE in November 2016 and later in Dublin in February 2017.  Concerns about the conflict in Yemen have also been raised at official level with other regional actors, such as Iran. <\/p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2017, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, which was raised in this House, and more robust political engagement by the EU.  My officials and I will continue to raise my concerns on humanitarian access at EU and international levels, whenever opportunities arise.  We also raised this at UN level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500009#G00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1516879800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct that all sides need to sit down and negotiate a political solution but that will not happen without some serious arm-twisting.

It is a bit like telling one's children not to eat sweets and then buying them sweets.

We are not directly involved but I advocate Ireland being to the fore in the EU in arguing for a change in this regard and demonstrating to the Saudis and UAE that we are not into what I have described.  There is an incredible irony in that the humanitarian disaster in Yemen is even worse than that in Syria.  The Irish Government supports full-scale sanctions in every respect regarding Syria.

Ireland does not have the capacity to announce trade embargoes on its own because trade policy is the collective responsibility of the EU.  In any case, many countries would argue it is easy for Ireland to say what it is saying because it is not exporting anything in the arms category.

The EU stands over sanctions on everything, not just arms, to Syria.  This has actually had a humanitarian impact but nobody is calling for an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both of which are responsible for war crimes in the area.

In that context, I am very clear on the impact of the sanctions but that does not mean that imposing them was not the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the EU imposed targeted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation in response to its actions in undermining the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  The duration of these sanctions is linked to the complete implementation of the Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  The ongoing conflict has cost over 10,000 lives, forced 1.6 million to flee their homes and created a humanitarian crisis which has left an estimated 3.4 million people in need of assistance and protection.  Any relaxation of the restrictive measures can only be considered when there is clear evidence of concrete progress on the ground in eastern Ukraine.  The lack of progress on the implementation of the Minsk deal and Russia&rsquo;s failure to rein in the separatists provide a clear and continuing basis for keeping the measures in place.  In December, the European Council agreed to a further roll-over of the sanctions to 31 July 2018 and Ireland fully supports this decision.<\/p>  <p>  The restrictive measures have impacted on trade between Russia and the EU.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the direct effect has been minimal as the majority of goods and services we export to Russia are not covered by the EU restrictions.  On the other hand, the economic downturn in Russia and the Russian countermeasures introduced in 2014 to ban a range of EU agrifood exports have had a negative impact on our bilateral trade.  However, after falling sharply in 2015 and registering a small increase in 2016, I am pleased to note that two way trade with Russia rebounded significantly last year, with exports expected to reach around &euro;470 million, an increase of &euro;120 million on the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  This is an EU collective position.  If the European Union is going to be effective in the context of international politics, its members must act together.  Otherwise, our position is substantially weakened.  If Ireland is going to have an impact on big international crises, the way to do that is try to influence the collective approach of the EU.

In February 2014, the US and the EU supported an illegal and unconstitutional neo-Nazi led coup in Kiev.  According to the constitution of Ukraine, the constitutional court of that country was supposed to review the case for the removal of President Yanukovych and certify that the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration had been followed.  Then the supreme court could certify that the case was worthy of impeachment but none of this happened.  A Bill that did not have the required 75% support necessary for his removal was simply passed.  The EU and the US had no problem with this illegal coup or with the fact that neo-Nazis took the top spots in the new administration.  A few months prior to that, Victoria Nuland, the then US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, revealed that the US had invested a lot of money to help get rid of Yanukovych.  An overwhelming majority in Crimea voted to secede to Russia and only then did the international community call foul play.  The idea that we would use sanctions as a political stick in this situation just does not stack up.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has said that this is a collective position on the part of the EU and that Ireland on its own cannot do anything.  Does he not remember the time that Ireland went out on its own and advocated for the end of the use of cluster bombs?  We were not making or dropping such bombs but we were a serious player in the debate at that time.  We can have a strong voice as a small, neutral country, but we are not actually neutral.  The very fact that we are still allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base undermines any notion that Ireland is neutral.<\/p>  <p>  I have great respect for the way the T&aacute;naiste looks at things in some ways and I believe he is genuine.

This is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marked a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely, political dialogue, co-operation and sectoral policy dialogue, and trade and trade co-operation.  The core aim of the PDCA is to open channels of dialogue and co-operation between the EU and Cuba to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy and work together to achieve the sustainable development goals.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2017, the European Parliament voted to endorse the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  While most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since November 2017, its full application will require ratification by the EU once member states have completed their internal legal procedures.  As matters stand, nine member states have done so and the remaining member states, including Ireland, have yet to complete their internal procedures.  I look forward to working with colleagues in the Oireachtas to complete Ireland's internal legal procedures and preparations are under way towards this objective.  <\/p>  <p>  The entry into force of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement and improvements in the EU-Cuba relationship will, in turn, have helpful consequences for the Ireland-Cuba relationship.  Ireland has a positive relationship with Cuba, which was further cemented by the successful visit of President Higgins to the island in February 2017, during which a memorandum of co-operation between the Government of the Republic of Cuba and the Government of Ireland was signed. <\/p>  <p>  My assessment is that the PDCA provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations.

The Government ploughed ahead and voted for the cut despite having the discrepancies and anomalies pointed out to it at the time.  I and my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues trenchantly opposed those changes in 2012.  This decision was also made against the background of the blatant and crude raid on the private pension funds of hundreds of thousands of people to the tune of more than &euro;2.4 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation was also introduced to undermine the very basis of defined benefit schemes, which led to the destruction of some of the largest pension schemes in the State, including the Irish aviation superannuation scheme and the Aer Lingus pension scheme.  The imposed changes to band rates and entitlements to the State pension resulted in thousands of people, women and men, receiving a lower rate of pension.  The changes included doubling the number of contributions required from 260 to 520 in order to qualify for a full contributory pension.  It was a replacement of the bands that had been introduced in 2000.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, speaking in a radio interview after the recent budget described the cuts as \"bonkers\" and \"unbelievable\", but he voted for the cuts.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, was herself exasperated, but she voted for the cuts.  Deputy Joan Burton has said that she regrets those cuts, but she introduced them and voted for them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's decision resulted in some instances of people losing in the region of &euro;30 per week, which is &euro;1,500 per annum.  This is a significant sum of money for most people, especially those who were solely dependent on the State pension.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, conducted a review after the anomaly was pointed out to her, and particularly after the Private Members' motion brought forward by my party colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and Fianna F&aacute;il which was agreed in this House.  It was agreed unanimously, with the abstention of Government Members.<\/p>  <p>  It was announced this week that the Government will partially address the anomaly by introducing a home carer's credit and letters will be issued to ask for evidence of those affected and asking them to liaise with the Department so the anomaly can be addressed.  While this is a small step in the right direction that is welcome, many related issues remain to be addressed.  The Minister is still not able to confirm how many people will benefit and she cannot rule out the fact that the pension regime will not impact on those who come to retirement in the next three to five years.  The Minister also cannot confirm when 40% of those affected, who are men, will have their pension reductions addressed.  Is the T&aacute;naiste content that Ireland is now no country for old men? Is the Government anti-men?  The pension's anomaly has to be addressed but it must be addressed for all of those who are affected and not just for the portion of people identified by the Minister.  Is the Government committed to reversing the 2012 changes in their entirety and reinstating the former pension regime, which is the fairest way to proceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500012#K00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1516881600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Over the past months the Minister, Deputy Doherty, has been considering how and when to address the issue of the 42,000 people who were affected by the pension rate band changes in 2012.  We listened and we worked on a solution.  This week, the Government formally approved a positive change in the pension system.  The announcement means that a new total contributions approach will be available to pensioners who were affected by the 2012 changes and will include up to 20 years of a new home carer credit.  This approach will significantly benefit many people, particularly women but also men, who may have taken time out from the workforce to look after children or to care for parents, and whose work history includes an extended period outside the paid workplace while they raised families or performed other caring roles.<\/p>  <p>  Under the total contributions approach, the pension given will more closely match the contributions made.  I believe this to be fair.  This approach will make it easier for pensioners who are assessed under the yearly average model to qualify for a higher rate of State pension.  The total contributions approach, TCA, will ensure that the totality of a person's social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - will determine the final pension outcome.

It makes for sober reading on the level of oversight and accountability in the State.  We need accountability in public office and the report gave us shining examples and illustrations of why we need a real change in Irish politics.<\/p>  <p>  One of those shining examples was the decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station.  This was a prime example of stroke politics if ever one was needed.  The head of Dublin policing told the Committee of Public Accounts that the reopening of Stepaside Garda station was not a policing priority and that he had more pressing demands on resources across the Dublin region.  Garda&iacute; on the ground are screaming out for resources to tackle gun crime, drug crime and gangland murders, yet we have the Minister, Deputy Ross, pushing pet projects and stroke politics.  Any decision to reopen a Garda station must take into account the best use of Garda resources, the best use of State funds and the policing priorities.  It should not be based on whatever pet projects are in the back pockets of Cabinet Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Given the need for a holistic review of resources, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, need to explain why the Stepaside station was chosen above other pressing needs.  It is hard not to conclude that this was done to give the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, a trophy.  The Government needs to understand that trophies do not make for sound policies.  The Minister, of course, will not be held to account for his actions.  The Government has form in this area and this is par for the course in this State.<\/p><p> Over the past 12 months, the Committee of Public Accounts heard harrowing evidence from the Grace case whistleblowers about their treatment by the HSE.  Time and again, the HSE sought to protect the organisation and people within it over the needs of those who were abused and forgotten until the whistleblowers came along.  This was also the case with regard to the Templemore training college and the millions of euros in mis-allocated funds.  This issue was raised for more than ten years and it was covered up until it was too big to cover up anymore.  We also have the disclosures tribunal at Dublin Castle which is trying to get to the bottom of the smear campaign launched against Garda Sergeant McCabe.  This man sought to do the right thing and was viciously attacked for it not by criminal gangs, but by the State itself.  How shameful is that?  <\/p> <p> We need accountability in Government and this has to come from the top down.  Therefore, will the T&aacute;naiste explain why Stepaside Garda station was prioritised over other pressing Garda and policing demands in Dublin?  What actions will the Government take to ensure that we have genuine public accountability in this State and people are properly held to account?  The citizens want, demand and need good governance, proper accountability, people held to account where there is wrongdoing and an end, once and for all, to stroke politics in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500012#K02500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516882200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Committee of Public Accounts is doing good work.

Sometimes it is uncomfortable for people but it is a good thing.<\/p>  <p>  On Stepaside Garda station, it is an executive function of the Government to set broad policy parameters in respect of policing, and this is what we try to do.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda divisions.  The programme for Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine their potential impact on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order, but also looking at issues such as where population growth is at its most intense.  On foot of the programme for Government and while fully cognisant of her statutory responsibilities, the then T&aacute;naiste asked the then Garda Commissioner to undertake an analysis to identify locations for a pilot scheme of reopening stations.  This was to have regard to population, criminal trends and the availability of stations for possible reuse.  The acting Commissioner informed the Committee of Public Accounts in 2017 that input of local Garda management was of key importance.  On 18 December 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner's final report on the pilot project to reopen six Garda stations.  This recommended the reopening of stations in Ballinspittle in County Cork, Bawnboy in  County Cavan, Stepaside in Rush, County Dublin as well as stations in counties Carlow and Wicklow.  The Commissioner has written to the Office of Public Works to progress the matter.<\/p>  <p>  There was a process in which we asked Garda management and the Commissioner's office to identify areas where the possible reopening of Garda stations would be good for policing and security in those locations.

However, the most senior garda in command in Dublin, who was fighting and trying to tackle gun crime and serious gang land crime, was telling the public and policy makers that reopening that Garda station was not a priority.

These range from the appalling case that I just referenced to the insidious type of cyberbullying that is now a grave concern for many parents throughout the country and the impact so-called revenge porn has had on both men and women.  However, our laws are hopelessly out of date and there has rightly been a public demand for us in this House to act.  The Internet and social media are a wonder of human ingenuity that have brought people closer together, but clearly they have a dark side.  In the vacuum of no clear Government policy, we had a Minister of State make the ludicrous suggestion that social media accounts should be tied to public service cards.<\/p><p>In 2013, the then Minister with responsibility for communications, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, set up an Internet expert group on Internet conduct and governance.  The group's report made a series of structural, legislative and administrative recommendations, including that the existing offences of sending messages which are grossly offensive or indecent, obscene or menacing should be updated to include new forms of electronic communication.  As the law stands, only phone calls and texts are covered.<\/p><p>In 2016, the Law Reform Commission report on harmful communication and digital safety was published.  It highlighted gaps in the criminal law, in particular those relating to newer forms of communication.  Last year, the Labour Party published our harassment, harmful communications and related offences Bill which is based on the Law Reform Commission report.  We intend to bring that Bill before the House next Wednesday during Private Members' time.  However, the second part of the Law Reform Commission recommendations that we need a digital safety commissioner is outside the scope of a Private Members' Bill because it would be a charge on the State.  The <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>reports today that the Government will appoint a digital safety officer.  I assume this will be modelled on that in the Law Reform Commission report.  However, the Government's legislative programme is silent on the matter.<\/p><p>I have two simple questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  What exactly is the Government proposing?  When will we see a digital safety officer in place on a statutory basis?

It is not an exaggeration to say that vast numbers of people are puzzled and infuriated about the Taoiseach's advice to go to the bank of mum and dad to deal with the impossible task of coming up with a deposit or finding affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1970s a couple, one a nurse and the other a council worker, could probably pay a modest rent while saving a deposit for an affordable house.  Today, even in the best case scenario, that is not possible for a couple living in Dublin.  A teacher on &euro;35,000 and a clerical worker in the council, on a starting salary of &euro;23,000, who go to EBS would be allowed to borrow approximately &euro;240,000.  If they manage to save a deposit of &euro;27,000 they could buy a house for &euro;270,000.  The problem is that the average rent for a one-bedroomed apartment is &euro;1,200 per month so there is no chance they can save that deposit.  Two public sector workers used to be able to put money aside but after pay cuts, pension levies, USC, property tax, waste charges, increases in motor tax and utility price hikes, they simply do not have the money, especially if they have three or four children.  The bank of mum and dad does not exist.  It is mythical except for a pampered few in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Even if a couple could get to the stage of having a deposit and a mortgage, where would they find a house for &euro;270,000 in Dublin?

All of these will help large numbers of people in different parts of the country, including in Dublin, to get their foot on the housing ladder or to find affordable rent.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that the core pressures in housing are linked to a shortage of supply of social housing, affordable housing, affordable private housing and the private housing market generally.  All of the supply indicators are moving in the right direction but there is significant pressure as there is population growth, leading to 50,000 extra people in Ireland each year, and this is happening in the areas where there is most housing pressure.  We are conscious of that and we need to continue to launch new initiatives that help certain segments in different elements of the market.  It will be more difficult to have an affordable housing scheme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire because land is much more expensive and is more difficult to get.  In this regard, there is more of an onus on the local authority to provide social and affordable housing on publicly owned sites, which is what we are pushing it to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should not dismiss good initiatives that are already attracting significant interest from potential home buyers, who are asking questions about a very attractive new proposition whereby they can borrow for the next 25 years at interest rates at somewhere between 2% and 2.5% on an income that would not have allowed them to get a mortgage previously.<\/p><p>This is a good initiative and should be welcomed.

There is a particular onus on the T&aacute;naiste to explain why the Government sold off the Cherrywood site to an American property speculator, ensuring that the prices in what will be a new town with the potential to solve the housing crisis in the whole of south Dublin will now be totally unaffordable.  He should also explain why the previous commitment that the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, would deliver 40% affordable housing on developments such as Cherrywood has now been abandoned.  Will the T&aacute;naiste reinstate that commitment?  Will he define what affordability is?

The Government is committed to uncovering the truth of what happened in this case.  We remain absolutely committed to establishing a commission of investigation into the circumstances surrounding the horrific crimes committed by Bill Kenneally.  This has always been the case.  When the Government decided in May of last year to announce the intention to establish the commission it was based on legal advice from the then Attorney General that indicated there would be severe delays if the commission were to be established at that time.  This decision was communicated to the people involved directly at the time.  The decision was made on a number of outstanding legal matters, including ongoing investigations into further offences and a concern that evidence adduced at a commission may impact on future prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that criminal investigations are ongoing in respect of a number of such cases.  Files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in several instances and directions are awaited.  The DPP operates fully independently of Government.  It is also my belief and that of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and all my Government colleagues that persons who make allegations of sexual abuse are entitled to have their claims fully investigated and, where appropriate, prosecuted.  I believe it would be entirely inappropriate for the Government to take any action that risks seriously compromising the investigations.

I will bring the House with me on this journey.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to present these three sets of proposed planning and development amendment regulations to the House.  The regulations were considered by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last Tuesday when I had detailed discussions on them with the members.  Many members of the committee were broadly supportive of the proposals contained in the three sets of proposed regulations and we got agreement on them.  I will take a few moments to give an overview of each set of regulations, all of which contain very important provisions and touch on a number of points raised by the committee.  At the outset, I note that the draft regulations do not propose to provide blanket exemptions, rather, it is the case that each set of exemptions have specific conditions or limitations which will apply.  In addition, they are also subject to general restrictions and exemptions as set out in the Planning Acts or regulation, for example, development shall not be exempted development if an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment is required.  In addition, where a particular type of development is not covered by an exemption, planning permission will still need to be sought in the normal course.<\/p>  <p>  The first set of proposed regulations, namely, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2018, relate to the provision of a number of exemptions for development works undertaken by Irish Water in the provision of water services.  This involves the insertion of a dedicated new class of exempted development, namely, class 58, in Part 1 of the Schedule to the principal regulations.  The proposed exemptions will permit Irish Water to undertake works relating to its normal day-to-day activities without the need to obtain planning permission from the relevant local authority.  This was raised at the committee in which regard I note that the provision is in line with the exemptions local authorities had previously.  It is nothing more or less than local authorities always had.  That concern was raised at the committee and, as such, I clarify it again here.<\/p>  <p>  The second set of regulations, namely, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018, propose to provide an exemption in respect of the need to obtain planning permission for change of use and any related works in respect of converting to residential use certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant spaces over shops.  These proposals emanate from a commitment in action 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring forward proposals in this regard and in the Action Plan for Rural Development as well as from a similar proposal in a Bill brought forward by Deputies Barry Cowen and Pat Casey of Fianna F&aacute;il in 2017.  There is a threefold benefit to the regulations.  First, they will bring on stream urgently needed housing supply in high-demand areas; second, they will maximise the use of vacant and underutilised spaces; and, third, they will rejuvenate and breathe new life into inner core urban areas in towns and cities nationally.<\/p>  <p>  The draft regulations propose that after they come into operation, the exemption will apply for a limited period ending in December 2021, which is concurrent with the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland.  This is with a view to encouraging the commencement and undertaking of the necessary conversion works as soon as possible and while increased housing supply is much needed.  It will apply to commercial buildings which have been lying vacant for at least two years.  While the proposed exemption relates primarily to works to the interior of such buildings, it is proposed that some limited alterations to the exteriors of such buildings will also be permitted subject to the requirement that such alterations are in keeping with the building and neighbouring properties.<\/p>  <p>  The regulations also propose that a number of conditions will apply to exempted development works.  As such, these are not blanket exemptions.  One condition is that a maximum of nine residential units may be provided in any one building.  Specified minimum standards relating to floor areas, storage space and the provision of natural light must also be met for each unit, thereby enhancing residential amenity for occupants.  On that point and following the discussions last Tuesday when concerns were voiced that the proposed planning exemptions might result in the application of lower building standards for residential units, I stress, as I did at the committee, that this exemption only removes the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Importantly, I emphasise that development works to vacant commercial buildings which are being converted to residential use under the proposed planning exemptions will still have to comply with the requirements of the building regulations.  The standard building control procedures and supplementary statutory guidance on safety, including fire safety, structural stability and ventilation, etc., will apply.  The draft regulations will not in any way change or diminish the relevant statutory building control requirements whereby all conversion works for this type of development will still require a design certifier, an assigned certifier, inspection plans during the undertaking of the works and statutory certification of compliance on completion.  This is to ensure that the relevant building control standards are complied with - that is absolutely the case.  There is no doubting it.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned to the committee last Tuesday, the building control standards generally relate to new build construction.  To facilitate the development of existing vacant buildings for residential use, a working group, chaired by my Department, was established in late 2017 to develop new guidance to provide clarity on the regulatory requirements which will apply in these circumstances and to provide advice on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of underutilised older buildings.  It is intended that this revised guidance will be finalised in the coming months to supplement the exempted development planning regulations before the House.  This is an issue the committee discussed previously in the context of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  We can discuss the guidelines at the committee again, but in their absence, the existing rules are there.  I cannot be clearer on that.  I hope that brings clarity to the issue for the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500017#P03800","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1516885200,"counter":306,"content":"<p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>I have no issue with the statutory instruments concerning water and broadband.  My concerns are about the draft exempted regulations change of use issue.  It is on foot of a Bill that was proposed by us, passed by the House and scrutinised by the committee.  It shared the intention of the Minister of State and his Government through this statutory instrument which is to ensure the quicker conversion of vacant units into residential use, especially those that have commercial zoning but are not in use and over-the-shop developments and refurbishments.  Currently, such applications are adjudicated on or interpreted by local authorities on foot of the only guidelines that exist which are for new builds.  The constraints of such guidelines in the case of refurbishment mean that developments of that nature do not take place.  That is in addition to the thrust of our Bill which was agreed with by those of other parties and none.  It proposed the putting in place of a one-stop-shop in local authorities whereby the various certifications for fire, health and safety and preservation amongst others would be brought under one roof with a speedier timeline agreed between both parties and certification to follow thereafter during and on completion of the construction.  I welcome the Government's commitment to the Bill but on Committee Stage it was nervous that those guidelines had not been put in place.  Here we are with a statutory instrument that still does not have those same guidelines in place.  Unfortunately, I was not present when the Minister of State brought this to committee on Tuesday.  I had a prior commitment at a housing conference hosted by ICTU.  Deputy Casey was there.  Our party is always represented at committee and it was no different on this occasion.  Deputy Casey raised concerns with the Minister of State.  I furnished a letter to the Minister yesterday, as soon as I could after realising those difficulties.  I have just received that response from the Minister.  I do not have sufficient time to peruse it adequately or respond appropriately.  When we discussed this issue and many others in committee, including the performance of the Government on Rebuilding Ireland, the Minister of State said his officials are fast approaching providing the necessary guidelines to meet with our requirements.  On foot of our commitment, will the Minister of State request the Business Committee to allow time within a few weeks for him to inform the House he is in a position to honour the commitment with those guidelines being updated to meet the demands?  That is notwithstanding other issues we have on the lack of proper definitions and the issues Deputy Casey raised the other day.  We hope and expect to pursue those if we can with the passage of our Bill which will further assist the sector and the market to respond to the need.  That is in addition to the initiatives and financial assistance that can be given in the form of a grant or tax initiatives to bring those void units into use to revitalise and re-energise many towns and villages throughout the country which unfortunately do not have the help and necessary means to do this.  Many months ago we proved the Government's effort with the repair and lease scheme was failing, despite the best of intentions.  We made recommendations and I acknowledge the Government has now committed to improving them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500018#Q00100","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1516885200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the further information.  Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty with regulation 1 and 3.  I will make some comments on the second one.  We absolutely support the intention of the regulation.  All of the parties in this House want to see over-the-shop commercial units, in particular, brought into residential use particularly in rural towns and inner city areas as quickly as possible.  I raised some questions at committee before I had to leave on Tuesday but I read the Official Report afterwards.  I discussed the matter with the Minister of State last night and we had opportunities to question the Minister, Deputy Murphy, about it today.<\/p>  <p>  I have four concerns.  The Minister of State addressed one of them, which was the compliance requirements, although I still wonder if it would not have been more appropriate to have something making that very clear in the statutory instrument as opposed to the verbal commitments afterwards.  I also have a question about whether the enforcement powers of the local authorities with regard to breaches of regulations are in any way diminished by the absence of the planning permission.  For example, if, notwithstanding the fact there are still assigned certifiers, there is something inappropriate, can the local authority still go in and do inspections and carry out enforcement action in the absence of a planning permission?<\/p>  <p>  I absolutely share Deputy Cowen's concern about the fire safety technical guidance documents.  The worry is somebody might apply, or not apply as the case may be, for this exemption following the passing yet there is a grey area in terms of what exactly are the technical requirements.  I am specifically concerned with fire safety.  I support Deputy Cowen's request for further information about that at the soonest opportunity.  The deadline for consultation on the new draft guidelines for minimum apartment sizes was today and I am not clear how that is going to affect this.  In many cases they will be apartments and it is not clear whether the new guidelines are only for new build apartments or for renovations.<\/p>  <p>  We do not want to delay this.  We do not want to stand in its way but our concerns are genuine.  If there is anything else the Minister of State can say to us today in committee or on the floor of the House to allay our concerns we would be very grateful.<\/p>  <p>  I also urge an extra level of vigilance if this is to go through.  Notwithstanding that we are supporting enthusiastically the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill and we want to see the one-stop-shop enacted, an extra level of vigilance should be put in place both at Department and local authority level to stamp out situations where an unscrupulous property owner sees an opportunity to subdivide inappropriately and create substandard accommodation for people, some of whom may be in very vulnerable positions.  I am uncomfortable having to make a decision in the absence of some of that information today although I appreciate there was a clash with committee on Tuesday and that is not the Minister's fault.  These are genuine concerns and it is really important they are addressed today and in the days and weeks coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500018#Q00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1516885200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the committee; I know I can attend but I was not present because I had a clashing commitment.  I have very much the same position as the previous speakers.  I do not think there are any particular issues with the regulations that deal with water or antennae and broadband.  I do not have anything particular to say about those.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation on the conversion of vacant commercial units for residential use is by far the most substantial of the three regulations.  I will not oppose it either.  We want to see this happening quickly.  There have been a number of previous schemes designed to bring vacant properties back into use particularly the living over the shop scheme which sounded like a great idea but never really delivered.  The living city initiative was supposed to, in my city in particular, bring good results but has been really slow.  It has been modified somewhat and hopefully that will be effective.<\/p><p>There must be movement regarding vacant properties, particularly in the centres of our towns, villages and cities.  I would like the modified initiative to be effective.<\/p> <p> I do not have particular difficulties with the specific recommendations but I support what previous speakers said.  I particularly support Fianna F&aacute;il's proposals for a one-stop shop.  I have read some of Orla Hegarty's work on the matter and it makes complete sense.  It would make matters much clearer for those who are trying to do things quickly as a result of the urgent need to have people living in these spaces, which one sees when one visits other European cities.  When I was in Paris recently for a rugby match involving Munster, I looked at lovely homes over commercial premises all over the city.  The position is the same in other large cities.  We need to see that this happens in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I hope that what is proposed will speed up the process but we also need to ensure that empty buildings are filled, especially in many of the towns throughout the country that have empty premises in their heart.  It is slightly beyond the focus of this debate but I want there to be a focus on that also.  I do not know why local authorities should not be given funds to acquire these premises, many of which could be purchased cheaply because they are run down and have been vacant for a long time.  Local authorities could renovate them and let them out as social homes.  When I was in the Minister of State's position, I worked with Athy town council on this.  I allocated the funding and the council did the work to bring properties back into use.  That is one example of what can be done.  I would love to see it happen throughout the country and I would love the Minister of State to take action.  It is not covered by what we are discussing but it is part of the idea of bringing people back to live in what could be homes in our towns, villages and cities.  That is very important.<\/p> <p> I also have concerns regarding the proposal relating to minimum apartment sizes, although that is not before the House today.  The Minister of State might give us an indication of the plans in this regard.

Everybody wants to see this being done in circumstances where commercial units can be brought into use for families and individuals.  No one wants to delay the process but it is right that there should be some debate because what is proposed is that, until the end of 2021, vacant commercial units can become residential units without being subjected to the planning process.  That is an important change that could have an impact in towns, villages, residential areas and so on.  It may have visual consequences.  It allows exterior changes to be made and people will not have the right to object.  There is also the question of fire safety and other issues where there could be serious consequences.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned about enforcement.  Anybody who has been a local councillor or who has been around and about knows that, as a result of a lack of staff in councils, it is impossible to ensure enforcement in respect of breaches.  Will the Government beef up staffing levels to allow for enforcement?<\/p>  <p>  The standards must be very high, but that is not the case with building control standards in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The matter about which I am most concerned relates to telecommunications and broadband.  Over the years, I have had much experience of people's concern regarding masts, in particular, and antennae, which are exempt development for most commercial buildings but which are often located near schools and residential areas where communities are not given the opportunity to object.

In fact, there are dozens of them and they could be used to provide much-needed accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the fact that officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government contacted me we to discuss this matter.  However, I was not entirely satisfied with the answers I received about how we will ensure that the safety and building regulations and standards will be policed and guaranteed, and that there will be checks and enforcement to ensure that these buildings are up to standard.  We know that there are plenty of landlords who are quite happy to allow people to exist in squalid, sometimes horrific, conditions, often in damp apartments.  There are landlords who are very capable of allowing people to rent in these circumstances and we must have guarantees that this will not be allowed to happen and that this will be genuinely policed by local authorities, given the exceptional nature of waiving planning permission in this regard.  Will the Minister of State give us assurances on this?<\/p>  <p>  What will we do when controversial planning applications are submitted?

For years, many elected representatives here have said that planning must be made simpler in certain situations in order that we have housing.  Unfortunately, many people have moved out of towns and small villages in rural areas and this has left them like ghost towns because no one is living there any longer.  We need to ensure that we make things simple.  At its best, the planning system can be very onerous, particularly in the context of many of our rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  There was a time when there could have been ten or 12 licensed premises in a town and many shops.  Unfortunately, we have seen how banks have absconded from rural parts of Ireland.  We note the change of use which is required which could facilitate a circumstance where instead of a building looking shabby, that it could be done up and have people living in it, and provide them with a home.  It is very important.  It would be a step in the right direction.  It would not solve all our problems but it would help and would be a step in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with others who spoke of the need to ensure that fire regulations etc. are adhered to.<\/p><p>What we need - it is grand putting down a motion here to change regulations or whatever - is staff up to speed in the different authorities so that they do not putting applicants through torture for hours on end trying to get something through because sometimes procedures can be differently in different local authorities around the country.<\/p> <p> I have something to ask the Minister of State that is not directly connected to this motion but that relates to the planning issue.  A circular was issued to county managers about one-off housing.  For living communities, we need the sons and daughters of families to be able to live in those areas.  If we keep letting populations go down, we will continue to see the numbers in some schools in rural areas decline.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, coming from a rural area, probably understands this better than most.  Whatever his officials, who might not live and work in rural parts of Ireland, might think, the Minister of State knows it fairly well.  I would ask Deputy English to put a stop to that type of thinking straight away.  We also need to ensure we simplify the planning process as much as possible.<\/p> <p> There is something else I would like the Minister of State to do that would be of benefit to the country.  We have talked about it over the past few months.  We saw the Apple planning process in Athenry and what the company has gone through.  I note that one of the same people is on the high road again, objecting to a project in Dublin.  We need to forward-plan and perhaps pick out eight or ten areas of the country that would be suitable and do all our planning.  One must go through due process - I am not saying that the State does not do that - but we need to have shovel-ready sites prepared rather than have companies being dragged through the courts.  We welcome investment in rural parts of Ireland that create jobs because they are required.  If we could do some forward planning on that, it would be helpful.  Otherwise, we will keep going down the same road with the same people.  They are nearly driving around the country following projects to keep objecting to everything, which is intolerable, is costing jobs and is affecting rural communities.  Everybody cannot live and work in Dublin.  We need to make vibrant communities.  As the Minister of State is involved in the national planning framework, I hope that when it is published in two or three weeks' time, it is a totally different document than the draft we got a few weeks ago because it was a lame excuse from a Department in the context of trying to achieve regional developments in all parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500019#R00700","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516886400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Michael Collins is sharing with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500020#S00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1516886400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Yes.

I fought strongly for it to be included in the programme for Government because it gives the Minister an opportunity to rejuvenate towns and villages throughout Ireland that have lost out.  There are plenty of them in my own constituency, for example, Leap, Castletownbere, Skibbereen, Goleen, Kinsale, Dunmanway and Drimoleague.  All of these towns need more life and there are loads of people looking for housing in these towns and they are unable to get it.  A two-bedroom council house has become available in Ballydehob in the past couple of days and while I have received a number of calls about it, they cannot all get into that house.  If there was a opportunity for more over-the-shop development, there would be an opportunity for at least some accommodation for these people.<\/p>  <p>  Making planning more simplified is something I plead with the Minister of State to fight for.  I refer to the difficulties the ordinary couple who are trying to start off in life encounter.  We all receive representations from such couples in our constituencies every day of the week.  They have been run out of their own ground.  They have acres of ground and they cannot find a site on it.  They look for a nice place to set up living and they have difficulties with the banks and with planning.  They spend 12 months fighting with the planners costing tens of thousands of euro.  They need to be in a situation where the planner sits down with them and identifies a site, they go forward and work towards their planning in a three-to-four month period, and for it not to be dragged out the way it is being done for them.<\/p>  <p>  I have brought up the issue of giving planning exemptions on many occasions with the Minister of State.  We have to be careful.  We saw what has happened with the Bantry mechanical harvesting situation.  Deputy English is tired of and worn out from hearing me.  I say genuinely the Minister of State is not to blame.  I will make that clear from the floor of the D&aacute;il here.  Deputy English did not sign that document.  I am not saying that, but the Minister of State will be aware the planning process was very flawed on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500020#S00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1516886400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>It was not an exemption, to be clear.

I especially welcome the situation regarding the over-the-shop developments.  I lobbied, with Deputy Michael Collins and the Rural Independent Group, for this to be included in the programme for Government, and several times since and previously.  Indeed, I made a submission to the County Tipperary development plan.  In addition to the floors upstairs above shops, many of the huge shops downstairs will never again be turned into a shop, and they have nice facades.  I also note in this regard that the Government will allow some change to facades.  That is fine, once it is not an extravagant change.  The regulation is badly needed and I support it 100%.  The sooner it is passed, the better.<\/p>  <p>  The other aspect is Irish Water.  I understand totally, as regards works and pipes in developments.  We are doing a major job in Tipperary town at present.  We must be able to proceed with all such works and the ancillary works as well.  I merely seek clarification on Part 8.  Do they need Part 8 for reservoirs or for bigger issues?<\/p>  <p>  I also have an issue with the masts for health reasons.  They must be located a distance away from schools and other public buildings.  I note they are on Garda stations and many garda&iacute; and their families are unhappy about them as well.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I have with Irish Water - I tried to amend this - is that the combined sewer at the rear of houses, many of which were built by local authorities 70 years and which the local authorities always maintained, got dropped off in the transposing of the documents on the infrastructure of the local authorities across to Irish Water.  I think it was deliberate.  The same happened in England and they brought in legislation.  I am trying to introduce a Private Members' Bill where householders have significant costs and problems with the backing up of sewers.  This affects every town and many villages.  These old pipes - these were quasi-public waterways because they were servicing all the houses - were installed by the local authorities and now Irish Water will not go near them.  Irish Water will not allow in the local authority workers, who always cleaned them, for example, with DynoJet to unblock them, to free them and it is backing up in people's properties, causing anguish and angst, especially to the elderly.  In a line, one house, at the end or in the middle of it, is getting the blockage.  Others are expected to pay to have them cleaned, which is expensive.  That needs to be looked at.  Those quasi-public sewers should have been included in the transposition of the documents.  I think it was deliberate.  Whether it was an accident or deliberate, it should be rectified.  That infrastructure should be brought in under this as well because it is causing enormous stress to many families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500020#S00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516886400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>In accordance with the order of the House, I must deal with the proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2018.

This is different from the way in which these motions are normally dealt with.  The committee clashed last week and we did not get a full chance to discuss this in detail.  If it is of help to Deputy Barry Cowen, I have here a copy of the reply to the letter he raised with the Minister.  It deals with and brings clarity to many of the questions Deputy Cowen raised.  I reassure the House that what is proposed is absolutely not a dumbing down of the building control regulations; it concerns an exemption from planning permission only.  All the regulations on fire safety and so on will not change.  Regarding the discussion about the guidance document, Deputy Cowen has asked that it come back before the House.  I am happy to commit to that.  I committed at the committee yesterday to do that.  However, that is a matter of the desire to make it easier for these properties to be brought back into use.  The guidance as of today exists until we have a discussion about it.  There is no dumbing down whatsoever of the standards of these houses.  That is not what we are encouraging here.  What we are trying to do with these exemptions is to reflect the workings of this House, what all Deputies seek and what we want.  The aim of Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill, our recommendation in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and the discussion at the committee is that these vacant buildings be brought back into use for residential purposes.  That is what this is about.  I acknowledge that most people here agree on that and I accept we did not get a chance to discuss it at the committee.  I was there, and the way the committee landed did not suit.  To put the House at ease, this is not a dumbing down of the quality of these houses.<\/p>  <p>  If any change is made to parking guidelines with the new apartment guidelines that are coming through, it would change for this as well, but only if there are changes in that regard.  There is no way around that.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's comments on funding, there are a number of schemes in this regard.  Deputy Cowen referred to the repair-and-leasing scheme.  I, for one, had hoped that would have worked a lot better.  I am still not sure why it did not.  We are making changes to the scheme to try to make it more attractive.  To me, it was a good scheme even before any change.  It is more attractive now but it needs to be pushed and encouraged, and I have asked local authorities to use the scheme to encourage people to bring forward accommodation for social housing.  There is also funding through the purchase-and-renew scheme.  Local authorities can buy up derelict or vacant properties, repair them and bring them back into use.  There are other streams of funding as well.  We want to tackle vacancy and dereliction as much as we possibly can.  The aim of this exemption is to make it easier for those properties to be brought back into use and make the process less confusing and less costly, avoiding the need for the contributions people would have to pay.  However, again, the scheme is only for developments of up to nine dwellings.  We are not in favour of letting anyone avoid the social housing requirements under Part V.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Mattie McGrath's questions about Irish Water, it cannot take part in Part 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500021#T00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1516887000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>&quot;Cannot&quot;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500021#T00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516887000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy Collins's question, Part 8 does not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500021#T00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1516887000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Excuse me, did the Minister of State say &quot;cannot&quot;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500021#T00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1516887000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Irish Water is not a part of that.

That is a planning permission and a licence permission issue, and it would be unfair to confuse this debate on exemptions in that way.  There are other issues in this regard, and my job is to try to put conditions on the exemption to ensure we develop it sustainably.  I have done what I can from my end.  As Deputy Collins himself said, it was granted a significant number of years ago by previous Ministers.  I have tried to ensure we control it as best we possibly can.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the point as to how we can guarantee this, we will issue guidance to the local authorities specifically to monitor and watch this, but all the current building control regulations kick in.  The assigned certifier, the design certifier - all that is there for any other building is there for this as well.  There is no way out of this for anyone; it is not a quick way out.  However, I agree with everyone here that we need to strengthen the local authorities' manpower and finances for building control in general and for development control.  We will do that, but there is no lessening of regulations for these buildings in this exemption.  Because of the nature of what we are doing here, I will ask local authorities to monitor this more closely and we will strengthen their resources to do that.  However, again, we are not changing the rules for these buildings at all; we are just introducing an exemption from planning permission.<\/p>  <p>  The planning enforcement powers will not change because of this proposal.

This Bill began its journey as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  During Second Stage discussions there, I made it clear that the Government was not opposed in principle to the amendment of intoxicating liquor legislation aimed at permitting the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday.  However, the Government was acutely aware that the Bill as drafted fell short of what was required in order to reform the rules governing the sale of alcohol on Good Friday in a comprehensive and non-discriminatory manner.  That is why, on Committee Stage in the Seanad, the Minister tabled a number of amendments to the Bill to ensure the proposed changes in the Good Friday rules could be introduced without creating further confusion and anomalies in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation restricting the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday has been with us since before the foundation of the State.  These restrictions were carried over and reinforced after 1922 and have remained largely untouched since.  It must be recognised, however, that the economic and social life of this country has changed dramatically over the past two decades.  Tourism makes a much greater contribution to our economy and this is particularly true during holiday periods, such as the busy Easter period.  In addition, changing demographics and increasing diversity in our population has, as confirmed by recent census data, lead to a reduction in traditional religious practice.  Taking all those factors into consideration, the Government considered, when this Bill was first initiated, that it was an opportune time to have a thorough examination of the current Good Friday restrictions.  As I mentioned, the Minister introduced a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage with a view to ensuring that changes to the Good Friday rules would be consistent and would not create further anomalies in intoxicating liquor legislation.  The changes made in the Upper House are contained in the Bill before us today, and I will turn now to the content of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Section 1 is a standard provision relating to the Short Title and collective citation for the Act.  Section 2 provides for a number of amendments to sections 1(1), 201), 4(7), 14 and 56(1) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927.  The amendment to section 2 of the 1927 Act has the effect of removing the ban on the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses and off-licences on Good Friday.  The amendments to sections 4(7), 14 and 56(1) of the 1927 Act will ensure the restrictions on the sale of alcohol in registered clubs and hotels will be removed.  The existing symmetry between licensed premises and registered clubs will be retained by the amendments.  In addition, the amendment to section 14 of the 1927 Act will mean hotels are permitted to sell intoxicating liquor to paying guests at any time on Good Friday and not only for consumption with a meal, as is currently the case.  For the sake of completion, I should mention that the proposed amendment to section 1(1) of the 1927 Act amends the definition of \"week day\" in that Act to delete the current reference to \"Good Friday\".<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1960, which relates to the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in holiday camps licensed under the Tourist Traffic Act 1952.  Again, the effect of the amendment will be to allow the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday in such premises.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the amendment of sections 11(5) and 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962.  The amendment to section 11(5) removes the prohibition on the granting of an occasional licence on Good Friday.  An occasional licence allows the holder of an ordinary seven-day on-licence, subject to obtaining an order from the District Court, to sell intoxicating liquor on the occasion of a special event at a place to which no licence is attached.  The amendment to section 22 removes the reference to Good Friday in that section.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Bill contains an amendment to section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which will have the effect of removing the restriction on the sale of alcohol on Good Friday in restaurants that operate on the basis of a special restaurant licence.  I am making this amendment because I consider that it would be inequitable to permit the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses that provide meals to their customers or otherwise happen to operate as restaurants but not in restaurants operating on the basis of a special restaurant licence.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that statutory restrictions of the type that we are repealing in this Bill are no longer in tune with today&rsquo;s Ireland.  The Bill simply amends the rules to allow for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday in a consistent, non-discriminatory and comprehensive manner.  The Bill was brought forward originally by Senator Billy Lawless.  I acknowledge his work and in particular his engagement with my officials.  I look forward to broad support for the Bill and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500023#Z00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1516888200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill, which Fianna F&aacute;il will support.  I commend the Independent Senators who initiated this legislation, particularly Senator Lawless, who the Minister of State mentioned was instrumental in it being put before the Seanad.  It is important to recall that the law in this area was set down in 1927 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act of that year prohibited the sale of alcohol on three days, which were Christmas Day, St. Patrick's Day and Good Friday.  In 1960, we got rid of the prohibition on the sale of alcohol on St. Patrick's Day.<\/p><p>The reason for that was that it was recognised as a national holiday.  With tourists coming to the country and wanting to enjoy themselves, it was regarded as anachronistic to have a ban on selling alcohol on St. Patrick's Day.  For many years, people have been trying to get around the prohibition on the sale of alcohol on Good Friday.  Sometimes people would go to the dog show where they could buy alcohol or get a drink on Good Friday.  On other occasions, people would take the train because if one had an inter-county ticket, one could buy alcohol.  We are also aware of examples of people going to restaurants and having the wine put in teapots and so forth.  That undermined the law and, as a result, it is sensible to change the law and remove the prohibition.<\/p> <p> The prohibition relating to Good Friday was introduced for the same reason as the prohibition on the sale of alcohol on Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day.  It was seen as a sign of religious respect that the State would not permit the sale of alcohol on those days.  In many respects, it was an anti-republican measure because this is not a State purely for those of the Christian faith or the Catholic religion.  It is also important to recognise that religious people are still entitled to respect and honour religious days of importance to them.  There is nothing mandatory about this provision.  It simply acknowledges that people who wish to buy a drink, who may not be religious or who are religious but do not believe that they should abstain from alcohol on Good Friday, will be permitted to do so.  In recent years, strange situations have arisen.  There have been major sporting events which have been held on Good Friday and people attending those events were not able to buy alcohol.  That was seen as unusual.  Sometimes steps were taken to provide for an exemption for particular events.  This proposal is much more sensible - simply abolish the prohibition on the sale of alcohol on Good Friday.  People who wish to be religiously observant can do that in accordance with their views.<\/p> <p> The prohibition has had a negative impact on the tourism industry in Ireland.  Many people come to Ireland over the Easter period and it comes as a surprise to them on Good Friday that they cannot get a drink in a restaurant or that they cannot go to an Irish bar, which is an important part of the tourism product in this country.  It is also instructive to note that perhaps the busiest day of the year for off-licences is Holy Thursday.  The reason is that people are aware that alcohol will not be available on Good Friday.<\/p> <p> Although I welcome the Bill and believe it is an important measure which we should pass, I should not let miss the opportunity of referring to the fact that there is a major problem with alcohol and alcoholism in this country.  While I welcome the fact that this legislation has got to the House so quickly, I should mention that we must promote other legislation which deals with the problems caused by alcohol.  I refer in particular to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which still has not come before this House.  It is important that the Government prioritises that Bill.  Most people use alcohol in a moderate way.  They enjoy alcohol at social events.  It provides people with entertainment and reduces inhibitions.  It has a general social impact on people when they meet.  That occurs in the majority of cases.  However, a significant minority of people in this country struggle with alcohol and with alcoholism.  We must do something for those people.  We must recognise that many people are badly damaged by alcohol and do something to reduce that.  It is a major public health issue.<\/p> <p> The Government must bring forward the legislation to which I refer sooner rather than later so we, as legislators, can try to deal with this enormous social problem.  It is not going away and it has had very negative consequences in Irish society for many years.  We need to have a mature conversation about the impact of alcohol on Irish society and what steps legislators can take to try to resolve some of those problems.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500023#Z00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516888800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Beimid ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille seo.  We support the passing of this Bill and we will not be bringing forward amendments.  Sinn F&eacute;in is a republican party.  As republicans, members of Sinn F&eacute;in believe in a broad civic society where all traditions and views of the world are equal, included and respected.  Deputy O'Callaghan is correct that in many respects the existing ban is not in line with a republican political philosophy.<\/p>  <p>  It is logical that the Government has moved to resolve what had become an anomaly.  I commend the Independent Senators, including Senator Billy Lawless, and the Seanad generally on their work in respect of this legislation.  Pubs and licensed premises should be allowed to open on Good Friday.  There should be no barrier to them doing so based on a religious custom or practice which held that pubs should close on a Good Friday.  That affects all of the public, in order to respect the religious customs of some.  It has been claimed, in the years of debate on this issue, that it would be disrespectful and would disregard the fact that we live in a country which has a Catholic majority.  For that reason I wish to clarify my statement on the need to show respect to those who wish to observe their religious practices on Good Friday.  They have an absolute right to do so and should be afforded every opportunity to do that.  The removal of this ban will not impinge on that in any way.  We do not believe that a bar being allowed to open on Good Friday hinders or prohibits people from observing their religious practices in any way.  For all its flaws, the 1937 Constitution has strong protections for freedom of religious expression under Article 44.2, and there is nothing in the Bill which is contrary to that.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is important not just in terms of what it says about the ban on Good Friday opening hours but also about what type of society we seek to be.  The more pluralist our society is, the greater it benefits us all.  However, the ban is an anomaly, and one with little public support.  In 2000, we abolished the holy hour licensing exceptions.  Before that, there were plenty of stories about the bona fide traveller exception and the rules relating to that.  They seem quaint and perverse now.  It is likely that the closing of pubs on Good Friday will appear as peculiar and quaint to future generations as those rules appear to my generation.  This Bill will likely be of benefit to the tourism and hospitality business.  The Irish pub is undoubtedly a great asset in that regard.  At its best it is not just a place to drink, but a place to experience music, craic and renowned Irish hospitality.<\/p>  <p>  Points have been made in the past about the working conditions of those who work in the pubs sector.  Good Friday was perceived as a day off for them.  This Bill has drawn attention to that again.  We share the concerns that have been articulated by Mandate and other trade unions regarding the working conditions of people working in pubs, licensed premises and the hospitality sector.  I welcome that the Government did not oppose the Bill in the Seanad yesterday relating to hospitality staff being allowed to keep their tips.  It was already the case that a publican could bring staff in on Good Friday to conduct a stock-take, carry out a deep clean or paint the ceiling in the toilets.  If we are serious about this legislation we should implement it but also consider legislation that protects workers, offers them opportunities and puts workers in this sector and the pub trade first.  It is increasingly the case that licensed premises are opening either on or close to Christmas Day.  We have seen that phenomenon in a number of localities and it is becoming more common.  I encourage publicans and people in the hospitality sector at the very least to respect their workers' rights by allowing them that day off and that time with their families.  This is a trend and, while it is still relatively uncommon, it should be discouraged.  It is important that those workers be allowed not to work on that day.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I believe this is an opportune time to briefly address the place of alcohol in our society.  There is no doubt that we have a significant problem in our society.  There is a need to take firm and comprehensive action to tackle alcohol harm.<\/p><p>Alcohol abuse is a significant contributor to many issues in society, such as the crisis in accident and emergency departments.  Much of Geoffrey Shannon's report into Garda use of section 12 of the Child Care Act, which deals with the taking into care of children who are at risk or in a situation of neglect, correctly focused on the roles of Tusla and the Garda but it also highlighted that alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction were factors in many of the horrific and appalling situations in which such children were found.  According to Alcohol Action Ireland, it is estimated that alcohol-related harm in Ireland claims three lives a day and costs the State an estimated &euro;3.7 billion, which puts strain on the overburdened health services, with 2,000 beds occupied by people with alcohol-related illnesses every day.<\/p> <p> In that context, the legislation is welcome and we will support it.  It is right that it is tackled.  There is a need for additional legislation in this area, such as the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  There were some blockages to that Bill when it was initially tabled in the Seanad.  Progress has since been made but there is still a considerable lobby and effort to try to undermine its provisions.  I am opposed to such tactics.  Concerns about the Bill can be listened to but it should not be undermined.  Rather, it must be quickly progressed in order to send out a significant statement about the intention of the Houses to tackle alcohol-related harm in the State.<\/p> <p> The Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill is a sensible move and rectifies a situation that has been illogical and out of place for a long time.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis seo agus deireadh a chur leis an eisceacht seo.  N&iacute;l ciall n&aacute; r&eacute;as&uacute;n leis sa l&aacute; at&aacute; anniu ann.  I hope it will be supported and that the same efficiency and initiative is brought to dealing with the more pressing issue of alcohol-related harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500024#AA00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516889400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I find it strange that there are so many aspects relating to alcohol we could and should be discussing but this Bill has been allocated almost three hours in the House, along with the time spent on its drafting and its discussion in the Seanad.  The big concern regards alcohol not being on sale in public houses on Good Friday or off-licences being open.  Who is it intended that the Bill will benefit?  We are told it is for tourists.  How many tourists have been put off coming to Ireland because there is a day on which public houses are not open?  How many tourists who arrive here to subsequently discover that public houses are closed for 24 hours get the first boat or aeroplane out of Ireland?  How many tourists have complained that they cannot access a public house on Good Friday?  Who will benefit from the Bill?  Are tourists who cannot last 24 hours without buying a drink in a public house or going into an off-licence the only ones we wish to come to Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  Another rationale for the Bill is that the Good Friday alcohol ban is outdated and not in keeping with a secular society.  That reasoning does not stand up when one considers the very unhealthy relationship we have with alcohol in this country.  The new strategy on drugs and alcohol, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery: A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025, was launched a couple of months ago.  In a foreword to the strategy, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, set out how drug and alcohol use affect individuals, families and communities across the country and that the expert panel, which conducted a review of the previous drugs strategy, characterised alcohol as the elephant in the room.  The new strategy acknowledges that, although legal, alcohol is a drug like any other.  The strategy contains many measures that should contribute to a reduction in alcohol-related harm and delay the early use of alcohol by young people.  What message is being sent by this Bill?  We need more Good Fridays throughout the year.  <\/p>  <p>  We must denormalise the drinking of alcohol.  I drink and enjoy alcohol.  However, it is normal in our society to drink on every occasion.  People take alcohol when sad or happy; celebrating a victory or coping with a loss; at first communions, confirmations, weddings, divorces, funerals and sports events; and on mother's day, father's day and holidays.  One's grocery shopping includes the purchase of alcohol.  I acknowledge that it is argued that public houses being closed on Good Friday means people buy more alcohol the night before but that is part of the normalising culture which suggests that we cannot do without alcohol for one day of the year.<\/p>  <p>  It has been argued in support of the Bill that the Good Friday ban is an outdated practice to have in a modern European nation that respects all traditions and faiths.  However, some faiths do not allow any alcohol and I have been to Muslim countries in which alcohol is not for sale.<\/p>  <p>  Another argument in favour of the Bill concerned St. Patrick's Day, which was included in the original ban on the sale of intoxicating liquor that has since been repealed.  In view of what St. Patrick's Day has become, could we imagine it without alcohol?  There would probably be a massive outcry if there were to be a ban on the sale of alcohol in pubs on St. Patrick's Day.  It is very sad that it is so associated with alcohol.  Is there any other country in the world in which a public holiday is associated with alcohol?  If one walks the streets of certain parts on Dublin late on a normal St. Patrick's night, one will encounter rivers of spilled drink, broken glass, urine and vomit.  Most American tourists are quite abstemious in their consumption of alcohol but I have seen and been taken aback by American tourists drinking to excess on St. Patrick's Day.  It is as though, because it is normal here to get drunk on St. Patrick's Day, they come to drink in a manner that they would not in the United States.  Now that the ban on alcohol sales on Good Friday is to be abolished, we may see more of such behaviour.  I wish to acknowledge an initiative taken by Senator Frances Black a couple of years ago prompted by her work with people affected by alcohol.  She organised a very well-attended alcohol-free event on St. Patrick's Day in the Gresham Hotel.  Similar initiatives could be rolled out to promote it being normal to go out and enjoy oneself without alcohol, rather than simply drowning the shamrock.<\/p>  <p>  There was much commotion before an infamous rugby match between Munster and Leinster on Good Friday a few years ago because rugby fans would not be able to have a drink before the match.  It was as though chaos would descend as a result.  The vintners went to court and won, which did no service to rugby fans because it was tantamount to suggesting that they cannot go to a match without consuming alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  All Members know that the Good Friday ban has cost vintners dearly.  It is also good for business for off-licences the night before and means the Northern Ireland economy does better.  If we get rid of the ban, there will be a knock-on effect in that regard.  It is all over the place.<\/p>  <p>  We know the facts in respect of alcohol-related harm.  Alcohol is a factor in more than half of suicides and in the risk of the suicide and a significant factor in self harm.  It is the leading cause of death among Irish men aged 15 to 24.  Alcohol-related absenteeism in the workplace is a significant issue.  Three people die every day as a result of alcohol-related harm.  We know the cost to the health service and justice system.  I have sympathy for the garda&iacute; who have to deal with alcohol-related incidents such as assault, murder, sexual assault and anti-social behaviour.  There has been an increase in referrals to services but consumption levels continue to grow.  Some 92% of those surveyed in an opinion poll commissioned last year agreed that alcohol consumption is too high, while 78% were concerned about the exposure of children to alcohol and 74% supported Government intervention to reduce alcohol consumption and protect people from alcohol-related harm.<\/p>  <p>  The alcohol debate in this country is riddled with ironies.  This Bill to abolish the Good Friday ban, which will give people another day on which to go into a pub or off-licence and get alcohol, will be considered alongside the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which aims to reduce the consumption of alcohol in Ireland.  It has been argued that pubs should be treated in the same manner as shops, which are permitted to open on Good Friday.  There is a vast difference between the respective services offered by a pub and a shop.  I agree that a pub is a far more social atmosphere in which to drink than the increasingly prevalent practice, due to the availability of cheap alcohol, of drinking at home and alone.

I would like to see the vintners exercised in trying to address that issue and taking a role in sourcing alternative transport arrangements.  Maybe, however, there is more money to be made in getting the ban lifted on Good Fridays.<\/p> <p> Ostensibly it is about getting rid of an old law.

I have two brothers who run public houses in Bantry and Bandon so it is only right that I admit to a conflict of interest.  I have a daughter who works in two bars in west Cork in Durrus and Kilcrohane.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  I find it a bit strange because it looks as though the Government is talking out of two sides of the same mouth.  Last week the Government supported the Road Traffic Bill, which will lead to the closure of public houses and this week the Government talks of opening up public houses.  I fully approve of these proposals to open up the public houses, for many reasons.  I believe the legislation that forbids the sale of alcohol on licensed premises on Good Friday is unnecessary.<\/p>  <p>  I am a practising Catholic, I have been all of my life, but I do not believe that imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol in public houses on Good Friday would take away from my faith, or from that of anyone else who practises their faith.  For me, this debate is not about religion but allowing local pubs and licensed establishments to maximise their business at all times, where they see fit.<\/p>  <p>  During my election campaign, I promised my constituents that I would do my utmost to defend rural Ireland and protect small, local businesses.  For too long, rural Ireland has been left behind and droves of small businesses, pubs and post offices continue to close for a number of reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that many pub owners are satisfied with the current ban as it gives them a well-deserved day off or time to do small renovations.  Many publicans, however, do not want this ban enforced on them and would prefer to choose their own days to temporarily close down.  The current and previous Governments are infamous for their roles in the closure of shops, pubs, family-run businesses and Garda stations like Ballygurteen, Goleen, Adrigole and Ballinspittle in my constituency of Cork South-West.  There is talk of reopening the Ballinspittle Garda station but we do not see it open yet do we?<\/p>  <p>  I have regularly commented on the Government's failure to rural-proof its actions and have commented on how the cuts and tax increases have had a detrimental effect on rural communities.  I wish, however, to support this Bill that I believe will improve the pub trade, if only slightly.  I am a proud Catholic and I am hopeful that if this amendment is passed, the sale of alcohol on Good Friday will be done so in a controlled and respectful manner, as is done in many other European countries.  The sale of alcohol is even permitted at many Catholic pilgrimage sites on Good Friday.  Good Friday has been traditionally respected in Ireland as were many other church holy days that have been moved or forgotten about by the church and society, I believe wrongfully.  I am fully opposed to schools being open on church holy days but this is now a common practice approved by the church body that holds patronage of these centres of education.<\/p>  <p>  Legislating for the sale of alcohol on Good Friday will also benefit our tourism industry.  Many potential tourists are put off by the current alcohol ban.  I recall a number of years ago when some foreign visitors met me in the town on a Good Friday.  They could not understand why they could not go to a pub; the Irish pub which is world famous.  They had come to the area during one of the biggest tourism days in Ireland and they could not go into a pub.  They could not understand why this was the case.  When I explained the reason they thought it was laughable that they had no problem in walking into a hotel and getting a drink but they could not walk into a public house and have a drink, see the beauty of the public house and have a chat with the local barman.<\/p>  <p>  People also go to public houses to eat with some people going to the local pub each day to eat.  Most people in Ireland who want something to eat go to the local pub to do so.  There are places such as the Paragon Bar and Annie Mays in Skibbereen, the Quay's Bar in Bantry, Arundels by the Pier in Ahakista, the Bunratty Inn in Schull and Sheahan's in Leap, where fabulous meals can be had.  It would give people an opportunity to get out on Good Friday, go to their prayers, have a little bite to eat or a little drink and then head home in comfort.<\/p>  <p>  Publicans can control what goes on inside the pub.  Many people drink at home on Good Friday because they cannot have a drink somewhere else and this can lead to a lot of issues in the home.  I fully approve the removal of the ban that keeps the pubs closed.  We should be able to open these licensed premises on Good Friday to give the publicans every opportunity to keep their businesses going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500026#CC00600","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1516890000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to speak to this Bill today.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, I also am surprised at the speed with which the Bill came thorough and the amount of time allowed for it.  I am a huge supporter of the rural pubs, country pubs and Irish pubs in general.  Their names are recognised all over the world.  They give employment and they pay wages, rates and taxes.  Pubs are a huge business and they are a vital part of the fabric of urban and rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I agree there are huge issues around the abuse of alcohol in Ireland.  Other speakers have mentioned the effects of binge drinking and alcohol or drug abuse such as child neglect, damage to health and cost to the State.  I am aware that under various Acts, we had St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Day and Good Friday as days when alcohol sales were banned on licensed premises.  Our patron saint's day was taken out of the legislation sometime in the 1960s to allow for drink on that day.<\/p>  <p>  Over-drinking has, however, become a huge problem.  I have been in the United States of America for three St. Patrick's Days, in Washington and New York.  People are not allowed onto the streets with a beer, be it in plastic glasses or anything else.  They celebrate St. Patrick's Day in a big way - almost more so that we do - with decorum and respect.  In Ireland, unfortunately in recent years the celebration has taken a bad turn with over-drinking, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has already said.  I will not be as graphic as that but it has caused a lot of strain and other issues.  There were riots on St. Patrick's Day in Dublin not so long ago and legislation was passed to deal with that type of situation.  It was not to do with alcohol; people came to visit from another jurisdiction to try to make their point and there was friction.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned.  A lot of publicans have contacted me because they want the ban to remain.  It is two days in the year - dh&aacute; l&aacute;.  It is two days' holidays.  One of the days is not even really a holiday because they are so busy on Christmas Eve, right up to midnight, and then they are open again on St. Stephen's Day.  They must physically clean the pub and have it ready for the next day so Christmas Day is not a holiday for publicans and it offers no break.  Good Friday used to be a black day for different denominations.  I am aware that some people have had a kick at the Catholic Church again and at other denominations.  Some of the religious orders do not drink at all and that is their right.  We do not need to be kicking them as the reason why we have to change it.  There is no need to have a bash at the Catholic Church.  The Catholic Church is not interfering with this, good, bad or indifferent.  Deputy Michael Collins referred to the church allowing schools to open during church holy days, which I have issues with because the holy days are just in name now.<\/p><p>However, that is what happened.  The Catholic Church is the patron of many schools and some people cannot wait to take that patronage away from it.  However, when it was running the schools, we did not have half the costs and those schools were run very efficiently.<\/p> <p> I cannot support the proposal at this time.  The Minister of State is well aware that we need to look at so many other areas relating to alcohol and supporting those in the Vintners Federation of Ireland, rural and urban, to sustain themselves so that they are able to provide a service and run a proper house.  These are public houses and there are laws, rules and regulations.  They have to be run perfectly, be clean and meet certain standards regarding food.  They have to meet all the health and safety and hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, requirements, and rightly so.  There is a huge legal onus on them to have properly run establishments and to comply with the opening and closing times, etc., relating to licensed premises.<\/p> <p> In the context of the disappearance of public houses, during the summer I brought the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on a small tour during which we saw seven or eight pubs within a radius of approximately 20 miles.  I have named them before: the Silver Sands, The Lady Gregory, The Cosy Kitchen, The Foot Bar, the Caravansary and the Glen Hotel, which is located in the scenic Glen of Aherlow.  They are all d&uacute;nta.  They are shuttered up and falling down.  They will be derelict buildings soon and that will be another issue for the local authorities to tackle.  Across then to the lovely Bansha, from where Louise Morrissey hails, to see O'Heney's bar, lounge and restaurant.  It is all locked up - d&uacute;nta - gathering cobwebs and becoming an eyesore for the wonderful Tidy Towns committee.<\/p> <p> We have to engage in a huge examination of the pub culture and drinking culture.  Since the price has been so high, below-cost selling in supermarkets has been a disaster.  We used to have a Fair of Cahir but it had to be discontinued last year because of the sale of drink to underage persons by certain unscrupulous off-licences.  There was no control of it.  There are many areas that need examination and a lot of moneys are wasted.<\/p> <p> I differ from Deputy Michael Collins who, I note, has a vested interest - he declared it - but I think we need to sit down around the table and examine this because publicans have told me they want their day's rest.  They need to upgrade their pubs on Good Friday, to paint them or do some renovating.  They cannot do this on any other day apart from Christmas Day.  One cannot get a tradesman to work on Christmas Day, thankfully, because they get one day off as well.  Good Friday is the only day.  One might call it a l&aacute; saor but it is not.  It is a day they have a breather to try to run it.  The restaurants get around it in any event.  Tourists will not avoid Ireland because the pubs are closed on Good Friday.  They love Ireland, the land of saints and scholars, and they are not going to avoid it because they cannot get a pint of beer on Good Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500026#CC00700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516890600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to speak on the Bill and I commend Senator Lawless on his great work on this matter.  It is really refreshing for somebody of my generation to see a Bill like this before the House.  As a Deputy based in Dublin, every Good Friday I see bemused tourists wandering the streets of the city wondering why every place they want to go is closed.  They do not understand why they were not given this information in advance and they do not realise that this country has such a tradition.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said earlier, it is somewhat quaint and bemusing at this stage, much like how I look back on the holy hour, having been told about it by my parents and grandparents.  It is somewhat of an antiquity at this stage that we decide to close pubs on Good Friday on the basis of prior traditions.  Good Friday is a tradition, but it can be observed by people on an individual basis.  I could still choose not to enter a pub or premises that serves alcohol should I wish to observe that tradition after this Bill is passed.  That is my personal choice and I am free to make it.  This is what we are all about here and it is in keeping with a republican political philosophy.  Ireland is a republic after all.  As it matures as a republic, we seem to be concluding that the deprivation of individual liberty and personal liberty is, fundamentally, a bad thing.  I absolutely concur with that idea.  People should have their individual freedom to choose and, should someone wish to not frequent a pub on Good Friday or any other day for that matter, they do not have to do so.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will have a significant positive impact on tourism, not only in the pub trade in Dublin but throughout the country.  Some people tell me it will lead to an increase of approximately 30% on their given revenue in a week.  That is a positive.  It will ensure that people do not lose out on the night of Holy Thursday either.  Right now, they have to close at midnight although staff are often rostered and paid beyond midnight in keeping with their previous working hours from other weeks of the year.  Ultimately, I consider this a positive thing.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the personal liberty argument, individuals already choose not to observe this tradition on Good Friday.  The simple point that Holy Thursday is the busiest day of the year for off-licences would tend to steer us in the direction of believing that Good Friday is not observed by a great many people, be they Catholic or otherwise, in this country.  That is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard one or two people mention the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  It is my considered opinion that this Bill does not stand in contrast to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill at all.  If anything the Bill before the House complements it.  It allows for a health consumption of alcohol.  It does not ensure that we store up on Holy Thursday or that we bulk buy and, therefore, run the risk of binge-drinking on Good Friday.  Instead, we treat alcohol in a normal way.  All of us in this Chamber need to consider that traditions evolve.  It was the tradition on Good Friday to not alone abstain from alcohol but also to abstain from meat.  Nevertheless, our grocers, butchers and supermarkets sell meat on Good Friday and I imagine a great many people consume meat on that day.  Therefore, I do not see why we should not apply that same yardstick and criteria to alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  All told, I commend Senator Lawless on the legislation.  It is good legislation and I hope to see it enacted before this Good Friday.  Bar owners and bar workers with whom I have been speaking are wondering if they will be rostered to work for the day.  As any worker wants to plan ahead, they want to plan ahead and would like certainty in that regard.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500027#DD00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1516890600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I welcome and support the Bill and commend Senator Lawless and all those involved in proposing it.  Tourists come to Ireland at different times of the year and the more we can get in the better.  Some are baffled as to why the pubs are closed on Good Friday.  I have heard the debates on the drink culture.  Members of my family had drink problems so this is coming from someone who has gone through all of it.  Whether it is in a pub, an off-licence or elsewhere, unfortunately, a person who has a problem with drink will get it.  These people need help.  There are many who turn things around and turn over a new leaf.  I have great admiration for them.  Thank God, some people can go into a pub or an off-licence and they drink sociably.  Unfortunately, however, some people cannot do that.  We have to be able to separate those types of situations from the spirit of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  If the Bill is passed, it is for every publican to decide whether to open his or her premises.  Publicans will not be forced to open.  If they want, they can remain closed on Good Friday in order to clean their premises and allow their staff to remain at home.  They do not have to open.  There is no compulsion on them to open on any day of the week.  Given that fewer people are around, many of the pubs in rural parts of Ireland do not open until late in the evening because it does not make financial sense to open earlier.<\/p>  <p>  We must also realise that this is an Ireland where a lot of pubs serve great food.  Ireland is renowned for the quality and service it gives and for its c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.<\/p><p>Many people go to pubs for food and drink no alcohol.  In many small pubs that do a small amount of food, there may be no shutters.  Without such shutters, a pub has to remain closed on Good Friday.<\/p> <p> The Bill is a step forward but it will not mean that everybody will shoot off to the pub on Good Friday because most people work on that day, unlike St. Stephen's Day.  Publicans and the Vintners Federation of Ireland are in favour of the Bill.  There are fewer pubs now.  While there used to be ten or 15 pubs in a town, one would be lucky to find two or three now.  The Bill the House debated earlier is, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, a good one and it may result in pubs that have been closed for some time and that are run down being adapted for use as housing without much of a cost to the people involved.  Publicans provide employment and they can still tell their staff that they can have Christmas Day or Good Friday off.  I commend the Senators who brought this forward and I ask the Minister to work with them on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500027#DD00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516891200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I support the Bill.  It represents a small change but one which will not do any harm.  I confess my great ignorance on this matter because I am not big into pubs.  In 1978, when I was 27, I organised a meeting in a hotel in Claremorris at which we always had our meetings.  The intention was to set up a timber milling project but it was Good Friday and the pubs were closed.  We held the meeting in my car and we set up the timber mill, which was an acorn that grew into an oak because there has been milling in the area ever since - albeit under a different company - and now it has the single biggest output in Ireland.  The law on pub hours would not have been huge in my consciousness until that day.<\/p>  <p>  Good Friday is actually a big travelling day in the part of the country in which I live.  It can be very annoying, when travelling throughout the country, to find that most places are closed, although this was more the case in the past because all of the journey from Galway and Dublin now takes place on the motorway.  A lot of people go to M&aacute;m &Eacute;an where the patrician pilgrimage takes place but I do not see how that would be discommoded by the local pubs and restaurants being open.  I echo what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said and I am disappointed that this Bill has come in ahead of legislation that has been in existence a lot longer, namely, that which tries to do something about sales in off-licences.  I wish we had shown the same alacrity in dealing with that issue.  Let us be honest about it.  We talk and talk about the health system but if we could cut down on the abuse of alcohol and everything that arises from it, and move away from our complacency, some emergency departments and medical sections of hospitals would be less full.  There are horrendous statistics on this.  In the case of some 40% of middle aged men who wind up in hospital, their illness can be traced to an overindulgence in alcohol.  At weekends, our emergency departments are chock-a-block and it often causes severe difficulty for hospital workers when fights break out.<\/p>  <p>  Some time ago, I mislaid the keys to my car, having left them in a taxi in Galway by mistake, and I went to the Garda station at 1 a.m.  There was an event in Galway on that night.  I have been on the Garvaghy Road when a march was taking place and I have also been on the Ormeau Road, but I felt a lot more comfortable there than walking down the streets of Galway that night.  I went into the Garda station and it a chaotic, with all the activity all seemingly driven by alcohol.  I agree that we should change the law but that will not affect the abuse of alcohol.  We should not take our eye off our real focus, which should be on the fact that there is a massive problem with alcohol in this country.<\/p>  <p>  There was a reference to the holy hour.  There is often a law of unintended consequences and a pub owner whom I know well still bemoans the ending of the holy hour because her pub was right beside the church.  When the holy hour was in place, families allowed whoever wanted to have a drink after mass to go into the pub for an hour, knowing they would be home for dinner at a reasonable hour - I think they closed at 2 p.m.  After the holy hour was got rid of, she got no customers on Sunday mornings.  One should always beware of what one asks for.  One of the things that hastened the death knell of the rural pub was the extension of the opening hours, and I was part of the Government who took the decision.  This was particularly the case on a Sunday night because it dissipated the crowd and where there was no crowd there was no fun.  People stopped turning up and those who were not working came late, while those who were working came early.  Since then, there have been far fewer people in the pubs on Sunday nights.  There are often unintended consequences, though I cannot see any in respect of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500028#EE00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1516891200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their broad support for this Bill.  The passing of all Stages today will ensure that the legislation will be in place in advance of the busy Easter period, and this is why it has been brought forward.  Deputy O'Callaghan and others made reference to the Government's Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which passed all Stages in the Seanad last December and which is expected to come before the D&aacute;il for consideration in early February.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us is simple and short.  It began its journey as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad.  I recognise the presence in the Chamber of some Senators, including Senator Lawless who was responsible for initiating it.  While the Government did not oppose the intent behind the Bill, it believed that amendments would be required to ensure legislation governing the sale of alcohol on Good Friday would be comprehensive and would apply to all outlets which supply or sell alcohol.  The Bill before the House includes a number of amendments which were passed by the Seanad in the course of its deliberations.  The effect of these amendments would be to remove the current restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday.  These restrictions are, in my view, unsuited to our modern society and the updating of licensing law in this area will further assist our tourism sector.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to Senator Black's sterling work in combating excessive alcohol use and abuse.<\/p><p>I note that in the Seanad she said she:<\/p><blockquote>Supports the legislation because in recent years Good Friday has been marred by excessive drinking in homes throughout the country.  The panic buying of alcohol in the days beforehand is a sad reflection of our culture.  Excessive drinking in homes where young people are present sends out the wrong message.<\/blockquote><p>Senator Black also said that she welcomed any measures that would help reduce the harm that alcohol does to the health of our people, and was delighted that Senator Lawless supported the idea of the pub being a regulated environment.<br\/><br\/>The Bill removes the restrictions on the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor and has been drafted to ensure that the removal of the restriction applies not only to public houses and off-licences but also to hotels, holiday camps, registered clubs and restaurants.  In this way the Bill will provide for the comprehensive and consistent application of licensing laws on Good Friday.<br\/><br\/>I was quite taken with Deputy O'Callaghan's reference to wine in teapots.  That is a new one for me.  It goes to show what was happening and the extent that people went to when they were told they could not have something.  People went off to get what they could not have while it was prohibited.<br\/><br\/>The Government believes the time is right to end the restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday.  We live in a very different society than that which existed when the restrictions were put in place.  The Bill amends the rules to allow for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday in a consistent, non-discriminatory and comprehensive manner.  I thank everybody who spoke on the Bill and supported it.  I note that Father Matthew, born in 1790, enrolled 3 million people in 1844 into his Cork Total Abstinence Society, even though he was born in Golden, County Tipperary.

The recommendations of the Oireachtas all-party committee should be the basis of any proposed legislation to be put in place should the people decide to repeal the eighth amendment.  Such legislation will be the legal mechanism that will govern termination of pregnancy in the future.<\/p><p>It is the D&aacute;il's responsibility to present clear and unambiguous proposals in order that people can decide on the issue.  There is a necessity for constitutional change whether that is complete repeal - repeal<i>simpliciter<\/i>- or the insertion of a clause which gives the Oireachtas freedom to introduce legislation free of constitutional challenge.  It is a debatable but important legal issue on which the Government will have to make a judgment.  However, repeal of the eighth amendment is what people want.<br\/><br\/>The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 put on a statutory footing the Supreme Court ruling in the X case of 1992 to allow for termination of pregnancy if there is a real and substantive risk to the life of the mother, including suicide.  The Act does not make provision for the substantive risk to the health of the mother, however.  It took 21 years for that limited legislation to be brought forward.  To allow for any additional criteria for termination of pregnancy will require constitutional change.  I believe there is widespread support for such constitutional change.  Many complications can present during pregnancy which need to be faced up to rather than ignored.  Substantial health risk to the mother can develop as pregnancy advances.  It cannot be predicted but it is a reality.  Fatal foetal abnormality is another reality which must be faced, as are circumstances where the pregnancy follows rape or sexual assault.  A further reality is that Irish women can decide to terminate their pregnancies, either legally by travelling to abroad to avail of services in other countries or illegally by obtaining abortive medication via the Internet.  Each year, several thousand women avail of these options and up to 170,000 women have availed of terminations since the introduction of the constitutional ban in 1983.  These are the realities we face.  As such, our present prohibition on abortion is ineffective and ignores the reality of what is happening in Irish society today.  Ireland cannot continue to ignore these realities and pretend to have a prohibition on abortion except in life-threatening situations.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is now a modern European state which exists in a global world and it cannot be insulated from the outside world regarding how it thinks or behaves.  Our moral code has to come from within ourselves and should not be imposed by institutions or organisations inside Ireland or abroad.  Moral values should not be forced on anyone in this modern age.  Ireland is becoming a diverse arid increasingly secular society with multiple nationalities, religions and influences, all tolerating one another and respecting one another's identities.  Increasingly, political parties recognise that this is a social issue that requires them to give their members a free vote on the substantive issues on the holding of a referendum and on any subsequent legislation.  On such a fundamental social, medical and moral issues, this is correct and it is what a modem democracy should be about.  After all, the people will have the ultimate say on any constitutional change.<br\/><br\/>No one person or group has the correct answer to this issue.  There is no correct answer.  What is correct for one person or one situation is wrong for another person and another situation.  We have to accommodate our differences and try to give people reasonable options and choices.  The extremes of no abortion whatsoever versus unrestricted abortion without any limitation should not dominate the debate because neither is desirable or attainable.  If this referendum is to have any true and lasting meaning, it must find a sensible acceptable middle ground which makes as much medical and moral sense as possible.  In such circumstances, we must separate the medical from the moral.  Many difficult medical decisions are made every day which have moral and ethical content.  Difficult decisions relating to termination of pregnancy are not an exception.  These decisions are very personal and should be allowed to take place within the doctor-patient relationship.<br\/><br\/>The Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution heard voices and opinions from all sides, particularly moral, medical and legal.  Having been presented with the best available evidence, they made the following recommendations: abortion should be decriminalised; contraception should be made available free of charge and every effort should be made to avoid unwanted pregnancies; sex education, relationship education and education regarding consent should be provided in all primary and post-primary schools in order that men and women are as informed as possible about safe sex; universal high-standard obstetric care should be available, including anomaly scanning, pregnancy counselling and support in crisis pregnancies; perinatal hospice services should be freely available when perinatal death of a baby is imminent; termination of pregnancy should be permissible should an unborn child have a fatal foetal abnormality that is likely to cause death before or shortly after birth but not in cases of non-fatal foetal abnormality which are compatible with life; termination of pregnancy should be permissible when the life of the mother is at risk, which is already the case under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act; and termination of pregnancy should be permissible when there is serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother.<br\/><br\/>The risk to physical or mental health can change substantially during pregnancy.  A woman may have a medical condition which presents no risk as the pregnancy commences but that can change as the pregnancy advances, quite suddenly in some circumstances.  This is an issue which must be addressed given the huge medical uncertainty as to when the termination of a pregnancy can be advised.  Is it when there is a 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% risk to a person's life?  Where does one have to go before life is deemed to be at risk?  These are difficult medical decisions which should be kept to the doctor-patient relationship and which must be addressed in any legislation.<br\/><br\/>The most controversial of the committee's recommendations is that, in view of the complexities of legislating for the termination of pregnancy for reasons of incest and rape, it is more appropriate to deal with this issue by making termination of pregnancy lawful without restriction as to reason up to a gestational limit of 12 weeks through a GP-led service or in a clinical context and to be determined by law and licensing practice in Ireland.  This is the provision which is going to be most controversial.  It is a provision I have difficulty with myself.  However, I understand the reasoning behind it.  How does one determine, within a short period in respect of a pregnancy, whether someone has been raped or is the victim of incest?  The committee's solution to incidents of rape and incest broadens the availability of terminations without restriction as to reason up to 12 weeks.  This is the issue most people will have greatest difficulty getting their heads around.  I can see and I understand the medical reasons for the proposal but they will have to be explained in depth as the debate on a constitutional referendum advances.<br\/><br\/>The legislation must make provision for conscientious objection to participation in termination of pregnancy.  Many obstetricians and general practitioners will have great difficulty with the legislation should it go through and there must be a provision for conscientious objection.  According to the ethical code of the medical profession, a doctor who is unable or unwilling to provide a service is obliged to refer a patient to a practitioner who is willing to provide the service.  Provision for conscientious objection is particularly necessary if termination of pregnancy is available without restriction up to 12 weeks.  Also, it is not clear how a GP-led service would operate and what function general practice would have in the supervision of medical termination of pregnancy.  This issue must be teased out.<br\/><br\/>I turn finally to male involvement in the decision making process in termination of pregnancy.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>As a male, I will never have to make the final decision regarding termination, but men are not absolved of responsibility.  Some men are indifferent to the plight of their pregnant partners and offer no support.  Some are very supportive and play an active part in the decision to continue pregnancy or to terminate it, and some are emotionally devastated when their partners opt for terminations against their wishes or without their knowledge.  Men have an important role to play in the debate and in the decision-making in the termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p> This is a very complex medical, social and moral issue which needs to be resolved in a sensible and inclusive manner.  The current constitutional provision needs to be repealed and legislation put in place to define the circumstances in which a termination of pregnancy is allowed in a legal manner.  It is now up to the Oireachtas to make sense of all that and put an option to the people that they can accept or reject having been fully informed of the reasons underpinning each proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500030#GG00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516893000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate, the tone of the debate and the contributions by Members of the Oireachtas who have different views on what ought to happen in this case.  I commend the previous speaker, Deputy Harty, on such a careful, reasoned and compassionate contribution to the debate.  His contribution has been in the context and tone of many of the other speakers.  Without a doubt, for many people, this is a difficult personal issue.  It is an emotional, medical and legal issue and one that might have lifelong consequences for individuals.  The work of the Citizens' Assembly and the committee on the issue has set the scene for what I hope will be a very thoughtful and positive debate on the eighth amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear at the outset that I opposed the introduction of the eighth amendment in 1983.  I recall being the subject of some vociferous criticism from people who had the opposite opinion because I had a baby in my arms.  People simply could not get their heads around the fact that woman who had children and who loved their children could also see circumstances where a woman's right to choose is important to her life, the life of other children she might have, the life of her family or to other commitments.  I am really pleased the country is going to be asked to consider the eighth amendment and whether it should have a place in our Constitution.  My position has not changed.  I do not believe the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution was in the best interest of women or babies.  I would like to see its repeal.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be very clear about the repeal.  I go back to the original advice given by the, sadly, recently deceased Peter Sutherland who was then Attorney General.  He strongly advised that the Irish Constitution was not the place for a section like the eighth amendment and that no matter the intentions of people, once it went into the Constitution, it would have profound legal and social implications and so it has proved to be.  I do not know that some of the people who argued for the retention of the eighth amendment ever wanted to see what happened to Savita Halappanavar happen.  That was just one of a number of cases that recurred over and over again every couple of years and which brought into the public domain the private suffering this caused to many people.  We do not fully know about it.  We know some of the stories because friends, relations, families and neighbours knew.  Although much of this was secret, much was very well known at local level.  In a certain sense, it is absolutely amazing that the Joanne Hayes case and what happened in the Kerry babies tribunal has returned as a matter of discussion and debate.  At that time I was living in Africa, working in development in Dar es Salaam.  I met somebody who was working in the ESB walking along the beach in Dar es Salaam wearing an \"I'm a Kerry baby\" t-shirt.  This was in the days before the Internet, easy communications, online newspapers and so on.  Pat, my husband, and I wondered what it was about.  When told about it, we could not get our heads around it.  We drove to the Irish embassy house to see if they had any copies of newspapers so we could try to understand what it was about.  We have many dark secrets in Irish social history which until recent decades nobody knew anything about.  No one ever worked in an orphanage, and no one ever sold meat, fruit, vegetables or food to an orphanage or provided services.  <\/p>  <p>  When I was first elected to the House in 1992, the story of people like Christine Buckley, who spent much of her early life in Goldenbridge, came out.  Most of the Members of the House then were male.  They told me they did not know we had orphanages.  I did not know how they did not know that but I had to take what people were saying at face value.  From the introduction of adoption in Ireland in the early 1950s to when it broadly came to an end in the 1980s, with the exception of overseas adoptions, over 50,000 adoption orders were signed for babies who were adoptable.  There were a lot more fostering arrangements and yet nobody knew about any of it.  Of the women in the Magdalen laundries, nobody knew anything at all other than in recent times when we heard about the pain and suffering.  I am not saying the eighth amendment caused that but the eighth amendment and the narrow and censorious attitude towards women who had children out of wedlock effectively destroyed much of their lives and the lives of the children were restricted unless they were lucky enough to find a good foster home or a good adoptive home.  That happened for many people, including me.  Never let us forget that is what all that sadness and pain in Ireland is rooted in.  <\/p>  <p>  We have been looking at the revolutionary generation from 1916 to 1922 and extraordinary women like Dr. Kathleen Lynn, who founded the first children's hospital.  When it came to the 1930s and 1940s, perhaps because of the dreadful economic circumstances of the early years of independence, instead of going forward and recognising a broad framework of rights for the citizens of a newly independent Ireland, we went backwards and became a closed, almost theocratic type of culture.  I hope we come to address this, perhaps on 25 May, because addressing it is long overdue.  I want to be clear about this - I support the repeal of the eighth amendment and the proposal of the committee that abortion should be available up to 12 weeks with the support of medical representatives and GPs.  It is an excellent idea.  It is important that people have proper medical support, advice and information available to them.<\/p><p> It is also important that we take account of medical technology.  It is approximately ten years since chemists began dispensing the morning-after pill.  At the time, I received many letters.  I do not doubt the bona fides of the people who wrote to me, namely, chemists who were concerned, appalled and outraged that the morning-after pill would be made available in chemist shops throughout Ireland.  I was told that it was not acceptable and would never happen.  In fact, it did.  It happens every day.  It is done in privacy.  Chemists supply a very important service.  GPs also supply a very important service in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500032#JJ00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516893600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Can I interrupt the Deputy to ask if she is sharing time with Deputy Kelly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500033#KK00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516893600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>How long have I left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500033#KK00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1516893600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Deputy has 28 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500033#KK00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1516893600,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I will take a minute and a half if that is okay.<\/p>  <p>  Last autumn, Dr. Rhona Mahony addressed the Labour Parliamentary Party in Athy.  I spoke to her at length on that occasion.  If one speaks to medical professionals, particularly women like Dr. Mahony, who work in large maternity hospitals, it is clear that the eighth amendment does not protect the best interests of mothers or babies as a result of the chill factor it imposes in respect of what medics can do, whether in routine or emergency situations.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have been freshly appalled by the story of Joanne Hayes and the torture she was forced to undergo when, effectively, she was put on trial.  Ultimately, that type of situation came about as a result of the climate of the era when the eighth amendment was introduced.  I am of the view that the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former Taoiseach, always regretted introducing the eighth amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The social changes which have taken place in Ireland in the intervening years have been very much for the better.  However, if we do bring about this change, and I hope that we do, Ireland must be prepared to provide a high quality service of advice and education for young people in schools and for people who have troubled pregnancies.  We should remember that it is their choice to bring a baby to full term.  It is a choice we must support entirely.  Equally, and especially in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, if they decide to have terminations, that is a choice that we, as a society, must fully support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500033#KK00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1516893600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>According to the CSO, the population of Ireland in 2016 was 50.49% women and 49.51% men.

There are many others.  We have a track record on trusting women.<\/p>  <p>  The Constitution was never the place to make provision for such a complex and deeply sensitive issue.  It was put in there to prevent this House and the Oireachtas in general ever having an opinion on abortion with which certain strata of society did not agree.  The dark forces of society in 1983, about which we all know now, were never going to trust elected Members in respect of such an issue.  This is something with which we must deal, once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the joint committee have shown that the Oireachtas has the capacity to discuss this issue calmly and with dignity.  I hope that informs the debate across the board in coming months.  Whatever the decision about the referendum, when it happens, if there is a decision to change the Constitution and make provision for new legislation to allow for terminations as the committee has proposed, it is incredible and wrong for any Deputy to say that they would not respect the decision of the people, whatever it might be.  I would like for Deputies who propose this to reflect on what I have said.  If the people make a decision, the House is bound to honour it.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to allow for terminations up to 12 weeks' gestation is the most controversial recommendation.  I agree with it.  I do not believe in late-term terminations. The committee has come up with a practical and workable solution.  I do not see how, in any sound, objective or appropriate way, it would be possible to allow for abortions in the cases of rape or incest by taking any other approach.  We cannot allow a situation where by garda&iacute;, barristers and lawyers would be obliged to debate all details of such cases before a termination might be allowed.  That would create an impossible situation.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot continue to outsource the issue of abortion to other jurisdictions. Since 1983, women have simply disintermediated the eighth amendment.  Once, it was through taking flights or boat journeys.  Some 160,000 women have had terminations by disintermediating the eighth amendment - in other words, by simply going around it.  We cannot continue to stick our heads in the sand.  I have a duty to the 69 women from Tipperary, to whom the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, referred, who had to take that course of action last year.<\/p>  <p>  The latest form of disintermediating the eighth amendment is through the abortion pill, which is widely available online.  Thousands of women take these pills without medical supervision.  This is not appropriate.  This situation is dangerous and must change so that they have access to medical supervision and they do not have to sit in a room, perhaps on their own, feeling lonely.  As a legislator, I cannot stand over a situation where women&rsquo;s lives are being put at risk because of this.<\/p>  <p>  We must also respect international law.  Amanda Mellet is a very brave lady I have met on several occasions.  I can say now that, along with Deputy Billy Kelleher, I brought her to meet the Minister for Health.  She is an incredible lady who had to fight for her rights and who was supported by the European Human Rights Committee.<\/p><p>We do not need to have more cases like that of Ms Amanda Mellet.<\/p> <p> I want to ensure that medical professionals are respected and have clear guidance on how they can practise.  It is not acceptable that medical professionals are left in limbo in this regard.  It is not acceptable to see situations in which women are suffering and going through obvious miscarriages or are bleeding but in which medical professionals do not or cannot intervene.  That is barbaric and wrong and we need to deal with it.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who I know well, to push for a May date for the referendum.  That is incredibly important.  My wife and I have never had a chance to vote on this issue.  Everyone under the age of 53 deserves the right to vote on this issue.  Obviously, a May date, given the ambitions and the travelling plans of young people, is what my party favours most.<\/p> <p> I want the debate that will ensue in the coming weeks and months to be respectful.  I respect the way in which the committee did its work.  I respect the way in which this debate has been conducted in this House.  Broadly, in society, we need to have a respectful tone for everybody's opinion.  Everyone's opinion is equal.  Everyone has their own opinion and we have to respect it, whatever that is.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, for me, this issue of the referendum is a simple choice.  While it is a complex issue, it is a simple choice for me, namely, do we support and trust women?  We in the Labour Party certainly do.  We will support fully the holding of this referendum and the conclusions of this committee in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500033#KK01000","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516894200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I will be sharing time with colleagues, if that is okay.<\/p>  <p>  When I was preparing to come in here to speak on this issue, I found it difficult - as did Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, to whose contribution I listened  - to put on paper and then deliver a pre-written speech.

As I stated at our parliamentary party meeting last night, with that freedom of conscience and that vote that goes with it, there is a responsibility on all of us to clearly understand the issues, to read the reports, to engage and to ensure that we understand why we are making the decisions we are making and that we have clarity of thought.  That is why, despite media interest ringing round asking different members what way they would or would not vote, some of us decided that was not the time or place to make decisions.  We decided that it was incumbent on all of us who had a responsibility to make a decision to make it following due process, having taken the time to read the report, having discussed it with colleagues and having listened clearly on it.  For me, the opportunity to do that is in this House.<\/p>  <p>  The committee, in its majority report, is clear in its finding.  I suppose the two findings that have dominated and set the scene are clearly the repeal and the recommendation that the law should be amended to permit termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reason up to 12 weeks.  Many of us have listened and have looked at the detail.  We have listened and we have seen correspondence, both to the committee and to many of us directly, regarding traumatic situations women have gone through in the past and are going through today as we speak, and I am mindful and conscious of that.  It is in that context that we read the report.<\/p>  <p>  However, from my standing - this is my personal position - I have read the report, which has constantly addressed the issues that face those women but I still come back to the point that the issue of an abortion or termination is still of a life.  I am not able to turn away from that and the protection that was offered in the Constitution to recognise that life or to remove that from the Constitution, leaving the Constitution silent or mute on the issue of the protection of a child and a life.  I have striven with this for quite a while to make sure that I was clear in my own mind.  I am aware that all of us who will contribute to this debate come with our own life experiences.  That is what informs our opinion - how we have been brought up, who we have met, what has happened to us.  All our own life experiences feed into it but from my point of view, it is difficult to see a situation where a protection that currently exists in the Constitution is to be withdrawn and that the life of the unborn child is to be regarded as silent or mute from a constitutional point of view.  That is why I do not support repealing the eighth amendment as recommended by the committee.<\/p>  <p>  We have all had correspondence from people talking about the very personal issues, whether it was fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest, but the recommendation of the committee goes beyond that.  To be fair to Deputy Kelleher, he explained that clearly, but from my point of view, the recommendation that the committee makes is a step too far and is not something I believe I can support.  I did not say this lightly.  I have reflected on it but I cannot see that the life of the unborn child, as recognised in the Constitution, can be removed.  I, furthermore, do not support that recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  As I say, it is a very personal decision.  For many women who are listening, it is not what they wanted to hear.  However, having taken the time - I refused to respond earlier - to read the report, to read correspondence from others on all sides of the argument who contacted us setting out all cases, for me personally, the decision has come down to the fact that the life of the unborn is vulnerable and without its protection in the Constitution, all of these laws are possible.  I believe it is important that somebody stands up and recognises that.  I have a clear conscience on it.<\/p>  <p>  What I am doing, for me, is for the right reasons.  Many Members in this House will not agree with it but, having listened to the debate and read the reports over Christmas, I am quite clear that I am not in a position either to support the repeal of the eighth amendment as recommended or to support the recommendation that is made in the committee's report as I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500034#LL00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1516894200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It is important that I, as a Deputy, put on the D&aacute;il record my position on the upcoming referendum on the eighth amendment.  I believe that following the Citizens' Assembly and the joint committee report, there is a requirement for a referendum to allow the Irish people decide on the future of the eighth amendment.  The Constitution belongs to the Irish people and there is ample evidence that there is need for the citizens to make their views known on the eighth amendment and, therefore, a referendum is needed.<\/p>  <p>  The majority recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and the joint committee are to repeal the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>This will be the core question put to the people in the referendum.  If the eighth amendment is repealed, the suggested legislation would legalise the provision of abortion up to 12 weeks' gestation on request.  I understand and acknowledge that there are deeply held views on both sides of this debate.  I respect those who feel strongly that abortion should be legalised in Ireland, even though I do not share that view.  I am continuously questioning my views on this issue.  I have followed the debate as closely as I can and have consulted with my colleagues, family and friends.  For me, the fact remains that every abortion ends a human life.  This fact is profoundly contrary to my conscience, which is convinced that all human life is entitled to dignity and to the basic right to exist.  Abortion undermines all human rights by ending the life of the voiceless.  I will therefore vote against repeal of the eighth and the legislation allowing abortion on request.<\/p> <p> I am deeply troubled about instances of life-limiting conditions, or fatal foetal abnormalities, and crisis pregnancies due to rape.  I am also conflicted about the legal difficulties that women and medical personnel face when a termination of pregnancy is requested.  I hope that advances in medical science and supports in wider society will reduce the circumstances in which abortion is deemed necessary, but there will always be cases that will haunt me, and I accept that this is a consequence of my decision.  I will always be troubled and conflicted by these realities that some women face and I understand that my position may deeply disappoint some people.<\/p> <p> All human life is fragile and in need of protection by society and our laws.  Pregnant women and children and families are not supported enough in our modern society, which prioritises the economic contributions that humans make, not the dignity that all deserve.  I hope the debate will be conducted with respect and compassion for all.  Every citizen must be allowed to make his or her decision freely and according to his or her own beliefs.  For many citizens this decision will take some time to consider.  It is important we as public representatives, campaigners and the media facilitate a healthy and fair debate.  I do not think there is a single position on the abortion debate that is 100% satisfied with its view.  Doubt will always haunt the big decisions we must make as adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500034#LL00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516894800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I would like to say to colleagues that I have always approached, and continued to approach, the issue of abortion and the right to life in a compassionate and responsible way and I genuinely respect all opinions on a matter that is very personal to thousands, if not millions, of people.  I thank in particular all those who have been in contact with me in recent weeks, particularly since the publication of the report - people with very different and divergent views on this matter, all of which I respect.  I am not saying I have the answer to everything or that I am right about everything.  I hope the debate continues in what has been in the main a very respectful and adult fashion because this is a crucially important issue.<\/p>  <p>  This debate is taking place in the absence of any Government proposal or indeed any real view given by the Taoiseach or a number of his senior Cabinet Ministers.  While this is a debate on the Oireachtas committee's report, it is not a debate on the proposal that will come from Government.  I further acknowledge that my party has had a conscience vote on this matter since 2013.  I commend in particular my party leader on his very honest and forthright views which he put forward last week.  Where there is a free vote within in a party, it means just that - that people are open to express their own views on what is, whatever way one looks at it, a life-and-death issue.  I take this matter extremely seriously and I have had many discussions with my family, friends and constituents.  I do not mind saying I have had a number of very difficult days and discussions on this.<\/p>  <p>  I have read the report in detail.  It makes a number of very important recommendations on the areas of sexual health and relationships education, including access to contraception and education.  It highlights very clearly under-resourced psychiatric services for pregnant women and the real need for greater investment in mental health services, particularly for those who are pregnant, including those with crisis pregnancies.  It also highlights very clearly the lack of education in many of these areas and the lack of uniformity across our schools as to how sex education is taught, the increase in sexually transmitted infections, STIs, and various other elements that relate to health, including sexual health, in this country.  The report is not silent on this and that should not be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental issue dealt with in the report is Article 40.3.3&deg; and the committee's recommendation simply to repeal it and take the protection that is there, imperfect as it may be, completely out of the Constitution.  I am aware of many of the heartbreaking cases that have come to public attention in recent years.  It is really important, though, that as a country we not only protect and provide for the life and health of the mother, but also do our best, as it is incumbent upon us, to protect the life of the child.  It is not an easy balance to strike, particularly in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and crisis pregnancies, but these protections are best enshrined in our Constitution.  This is why the recommendation from the committee simply to remove Article 40.3.3&deg;, repeal the eighth amendment and leave it solely to the Oireachtas to legislate in the future is something I am deeply uncomfortable with and cannot support.  There would be no barrier to any future Oireachtas, as far as I can see, restricting the provision not simply to 12 weeks, but to 16 weeks, 20 weeks and so on.  This is a big issue for me.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding referendums, changes to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann are sovereign to the people.  If we are simply to repeal the eighth amendment, it would mean that people would have no say in the future on this.  However, as a democrat, I will put it to the House this way: I certainly do not fear a referendum.  A referendum on this issue will happen and, as a democrat, I will accept fully the vote of the people in such a future referendum.  I have no difficulty in saying that.  However, the irony is that the people would be asked to give away their rights and give away a right within the Constitution by voting it away in a referendum.  While this is an extremely complex and personal matter, and one to which I intend to return when the Government actually publishes its proposals and when it has received the relevant legal advice, the simple removal of Article 40.3.3&deg; and repeal of the eighth amendment is not something I can support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500035#MM00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1516894800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to state my position on the eighth amendment on the record of the D&aacute;il.  I have always believed that standing by my principles and speaking from the heart will never send me too far wrong, and that is how I have approached this issue from the very beginning.  This is a very contentious and polarising issue in Irish society and has been for decades.  As an Irish citizen, I have put politics aside on many occasions in the past and reflected honestly on this issue.  I have spent much time in recent days and weeks reflecting upon this issue as we move towards a referendum and pressure is put on politicians from the public that elected them to office to take stances and state their positions.  Following such periods of reflection, I have always come to the same conclusion: I am pro-life.  I believe in the rights of the unborn as stated in our Constitution and believe these rights must be protected at all costs.  However, as a public representative, I also have a responsibility to my constituents.  The people who have voted for me in numerous local and general elections, and whom I have the honour to represent, are well aware of my beliefs in this regard.  Therefore, I believe I have a mandate from the majority of my constituents to be a pro-life politician.  I am opposed to the outright repeal of the eighth amendment as I believe the rights of the unborn as stated in our Constitution must be protected.  I am opposed to unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks' gestation.  This is not to say that I do not respect or accept the work which has been carried out over many weeks and months by representatives of all parties and none in the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  This is not to say that I do not respect or accept the views of my colleagues, my constituents, my family and friends or anyone who considers himself or herself pro-choice.<\/p><p>Everyone is entitled to their views and their opinion on this subject.  I am hopeful that all sides respect the views of one another and that respectful debate takes place over the next few months.<\/p> <p> I firmly believe in democracy, which entitles everyone to his or her opinion and viewpoint.  I am a lifelong believer in democracy and that is why I became a politician.  I believe in democracy down to my very bones.  This is why I firmly believe the Irish people are entitled to have their say on this matter for the first time in nearly 35 years.  The Government has committed to holding a referendum on the eighth amendment.  This is now a reality and I support the people's right to have their say in a referendum on any matter.  However, if the question is put that we should have an outright repeal of the eighth amendment and replace it with legislation for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks, I cannot support that.  This is my long held personal and political stance and one I did not reach lightly.  Ultimately, I will respect the result of the referendum as the will of the people of Ireland.<\/p> <p> If I am truly honest with myself on the eighth amendment, there are areas of it about which I have great concern.  The situation whereby women purchase unregulated and illegal abortion pills over the Internet must be seriously looked at.  This is a dangerous practice that requires the Government's attention when drafting any legislation.  If we can provide more adequate supports and resources that would assist the women in this position, outside of unrestricted abortion, we must seek to do that.  I also have concerns about rape and incest.  The women in such harrowing situations are obviously very traumatised and require the State's support at every turn, but there are two lives to be considered in such instances, and there are many well documented cases of people who are grown adults and human beings who walk among us today who support the rights of the unborn and are against abortion.  This shows us that termination is not always the answer.  I also have concerns surrounding babies who are deemed to have a fatal foetal abnormality.  I do not like using that term, but it is the term which is most commonly used.<\/p> <p> I am on the record as stating if appropriate medical personnel conclude that the mother&rsquo;s life is at risk, and if appropriate medical personnel also conclude, beyond all medical doubt, that the foetus will not survive, and both parents are in agreement, then as a last resort abortion should be considered in this case, if deemed medically necessary, but this is not a black and white issue.  The word abortion is repugnant and abhorrent to me.  The eighth amendment is the only protection of the unborn in our society and for that reason it has to be retained or, if amended, there must still be the right to hold it in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500035#MM00300","speaker":"1368","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516895400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Nobody in this Chamber knows what anybody else is dealing with, or has dealt with in the past.  As politicians in this room, we all know that nobody ever knows what is really behind a hall door, no matter where it is in the country.  In this country, we have abdicated responsibility in the area of supporting women in a crisis pregnancy or an unplanned pregnancy and instead the Irish solution has been to let somebody else sort it out.<\/p>  <p>  I am proud that Fine Gael in government is not happy with that stance, and even though there are differing views within the party and within the House, all of which I respect, we as an Oireachtas are going to tackle this issue head on and let the people decide how we support women in the area of health.  Let the decision be between the woman and her doctor, because I trust women to make a decision on what is in the best interests for them or their family.<\/p>  <p>  We all know the statistics of women who have taken abortion pills or who have left the country to have an abortion.  Behind every statistic we look at is a woman, a couple or a family going through one of the most stressful and difficult times of their lives, a time that will never leave them.  We have exported this problem for years and our solution is to import an illegal solution.  The UK has been a safety valve for our problem for far too long.  As legislators, we have a duty of care to these women, whatever their decision may be, to support them through those difficult weeks or to medically intervene where needed.  I am not comfortable thinking any woman, this evening, yesterday, 20 years ago or tomorrow, might take an abortion pill at home in fear, who feels isolated or on her own or, if it goes wrong, afraid to go to an accident and emergency department.  That is not a comfortable position for me to be in.<\/p>  <p>  There is a history in this State of, like the three monkeys, hearing no evil, seeing no evil and speaking no evil.  If we do not talk about it, it is not happening, or we like to think it is not happening.  However, we clearly know, as we stand here today, that ten women, following on from the 170,000 that went before them, are travelling to have their medical need met.  We have covered our ears, we have closed our eyes and we have shut our mouths because that is the easiest way to pretend it is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  I am the proud mother of two young beautiful girls whom I nurtured when I was pregnant and continue to nurture.  I want the best for them throughout their lives and for them to be able to make clear and conscious decisions for their future.  I did not come to my decision easily.  I am very uncomfortable with abortion but as somebody in the position I hold, and which I am proud to hold, I have a duty of care to women and their families to make sure they feel their country is there for them at their time of need.  For this reason, I support the committee's recommendations and repeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500036#NN00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1516895400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>On several occasions in the past week I have attempted to put together the correct words to adequately respond to this report.  It has been an agonising and most difficult experience.  The process put in place by the previous Government involved the provision of a citizens' assembly to review and make recommendations surrounding the suitability or otherwise of the eighth amendment.  It was then for the Oireachtas to examine those recommendations and report accordingly.  The Oireachtas committee was formed and approved, and it set out to examine and consider the assembly's recommendations.  In doing so, it considered the professional expert evidence, advice and consideration of relevant medical and legal opinion.  Thus, having assimilated, asked questions on, scrutinised and considered all the information that emanated from that process, it made its own recommendations in the report before the House.<\/p>  <p>  All members of the committee, whether they were part of the final consensus or not, have to be thanked and commended on taking upon themselves such a body of work on behalf of the rest of us.  We, because of their work, are now in a far more informed position to reflect on the suitability of the eighth amendment in the Constitution for the Ireland we live in today and, consequently, ask the Irish people to do likewise.<\/p>  <p>  Politics is a challenging career.  It is a very demanding profession.  It can and does place a great strain on one's life, particularly family life.  As technology and advancements in communication methods improve, one has the opportunity, at least, to strike a balance.  As we all know, there is an innate decency in the Irish people who, in the main, recognise hard work, effort and commitment.  The greatest reward in politics I believe is to enter Government to enact policy to support the people via electoral success.  Those who went before us created and provided the foundations for that democracy.  They achieved our independence and gave the D&aacute;il its powers, and ensured the generations who came after had the opportunity to realise their various wishes and aspirations.  Those aspirations were, and are, evident in the 1916 Proclamation, the declaration of independence in 1919, the Constitution of 1937 and the Republic of Ireland Act 1948.<\/p>  <p>  The Constitution is the legal document that sets out how Ireland should be governed.  It lays out the powers of the Legislature, the oversight of the courts and, most importantly, as others have referred to, the people's sovereign right to amend it.  Society itself, let alone Irish society, has changed greatly since 1937.  Each generation has learned from its predecessors.  No one generation has had the monopoly on solutions to societal change.  Our generation at this juncture has a huge responsibility to meet what could be described as the greatest possible societal challenge.<\/p><p>It is faced with seeking to separate, equate or measure the health, life and death of women and the unborn.  This is a challenge that has tortured the minds of this nation.  It is a challenge we thought was met by the amendment and Article 40.3.3&deg;.  We all cherish the lives of women and children and we would want our Constitution, our courts, our D&aacute;il and our people to be proud of that.  Unfortunately, that utopia has not materialised so far in the way one would wish.  We must now again seek to address these matters in a way that is balanced, respectful and real.  I am prepared to meet that challenge as best I can.  I would rather if I did not have to do it in my lifetime, to be honest, but nonetheless I will face that challenge.  I doubt many people in the electorate will relish the prospect either of an upcoming referendum on the matter.<\/p> <p> I was the beneficiary of a loving and cherished childhood.  My character was shaped by my family, community, schools, church, various cultures and sport.  It was later enhanced in work, marriage and parenting.  That combination has made me what I am today.  I am no more perfect than anybody else here but I have a value system.  I like to think I can tell the difference between right and wrong.  All Members of the D&aacute;il are or should be republicans, respecting the views, rights and aspirations of everybody, among other things.<\/p> <p> I am also a proud member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I acknowledge, on matters of conscience, that Fianna F&aacute;il afforded its members, irrespective of one's position or rank in the parliamentary party or outside it, the right to a personal position.  This was intentional and the surprise in some quarters that all our members do not have the same position on whether the eighth amendment should be repealed or altered, or whether the Oireachtas should be afforded the privilege to legislate on the matter, is difficult to comprehend.  The difference of opinion in Fianna F&aacute;il is merely reflective of the difference of opinion within society and all political parties, organisations, communities and even families.  If our detractors believe such differences afford the opportunity to divide us or create a rift while undermining us, they are wrong.  Our republicanism will outshine those efforts.  Not only has it been evident within our parliamentary party, but it will be evident at every crossroads in the country when our cumainn sit down to discuss it also.  The correct forum for Members of the House to respond to this report is in this Chamber.  Here, the record will indicate the context, thought process, logic, reason and detail of one's personal and individual decision.  It cannot be misinterpreted or misrepresented here and it will not be disputed.<\/p> <p> I should make it clear that terminations in every circumstance are traumatic and unimaginable for me.  These are terribly difficult decisions for any woman to make.  Nobody would make such a decision easily or lightly.  The debate on this matter has often painted women in a very negative light and it is time that stopped.  We must stop at least the name calling and judgments.  It is time to protect and assist women.  Having read the report it is clear that repealing the amendment is essential to providing adequate health care for women.  It is also essential for doctors to do their duties as they see fit.<\/p> <p> Since becoming a Deputy I have been present as the State offered apologies to the women of the Magdalen laundries and, more recently, to Joanna Hayes, the woman at the centre of the Kerry babies case.  I have only been a Deputy for seven years but I have come to realise the horrors inflicted on women - particularly and crucially, pregnant women - in this State.  I cannot think one thing and state another.  I cannot stand by and allow similar mistakes to be made as we saw in the past.  I have heard stories, as many Members have and recalled during the course of this debate, of women who were the victims of the most heinous acts of rape and incest.  I have heard incidents of where women and couples received the most tragic diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality.  While every effort, support and assistance for mental and physical health should be afforded at every opportunity to seek to allow a pregnancy to continue, I do not accept it is my right or anybody else's to force such women to carry a pregnancy they do not want or where a baby will not survive outside the womb.<\/p> <p> There are people who say they want change in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities but do not agree with repeal.  I ask them, honestly and earnestly, to offer an alternative solution.  They should be mindful that the report tells us that the Oireachtas committee examined this matter for four months and could not find a solution, despite having the best medical and legal expertise.  It could not be done while retaining the eighth amendment or involving legislation.  Legislating for cases involving rape and incest is not possible as a woman would have to prove she is a victim of heinous crimes.  It would be unfair for some people to give the impression they have compassion for these women, while seeking to further traumatise them in this way.  There is an absence of alternative solutions and knowledge that legal certainties cannot bring proof of rape or incest.  The State has been exposed in violating human rights in the Mellet and Whelan cases and there is a dreaded fear about the unregulated provision of abortion pills from the Internet, which in time could replicate the sort of trauma and terrible tragedy that befell the nation on the death of Savita Halappanavar.  It is the sort of vista facing us if we do not deal with the matter now.<\/p> <p> It would be much simpler for me if I did not go into great depth, was not of inquisitive mind and did not take my job seriously.  It would be easier if I did not study this or take on board the medical expertise from obstetricians and legal experts who have studied the Constitution and know about legislation.  I must accept the findings of the committee.  The Government must now bring forward its considered verdict as to how best to formulate the question of repeal for the Irish people.  It is the duty and obligation of the Government, via the referendum commission, to adequately and appropriately inform the Irish people of all the relevant professional, expert, medical and legal advice necessary so as to ensure that an informed electorate can give their verdict.  This electorate is not necessarily divided in an urban-rural way or by young and old.  This electorate will be adequately armed to ensure a respectful debate and discourse.  That will maximise the potential that the result for the nation and its D&aacute;il can be respected and acted upon.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> I sincerely hope the debate on this issue, the forthcoming referendum and what may follow will not be politicised.  I attended an ICTU conference on housing last Tuesday.  I had been asked by my party to inform the conference of our policy and resolutions should we attain office in government.  Yesterday, I spoke in favour of a Fianna F&aacute;il motion on the pay inequality issue for young teachers, its effect on their morale, the ability to do their job and to meet the demands of society, and the costs associated with that for them.  My ability to work on behalf of my constituents will not be diminished because of my opinions on this issue.  I remain committed to working in the D&aacute;il on behalf of my constituents and I will not take kindly to political opponents in my constituency or elsewhere seeking to use this issue alone as a reason to influence voters when there are elections to the D&aacute;il.  That is a cheap politicisation of a complex and personal matter, and I believe it will not rest easily with reasonable people.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I again acknowledge the work of those who took it upon themselves to act on our behalf and in our best interests in placing this report before the D&aacute;il.  I encourage all Members to make their views known.  Each of us has only one vote in the referendum but it is seldom a responsibility of this magnitude is placed on people who are lucky enough to be Members.  It is time to show the methodology and reasoning that went into forming one's opinion and conscience on this issue.  We owe that, to ensure the electorate and general public are as informed as we were, by whatever means necessary, so they can make a decision they can stand over and be happy with.  I, like the rest of the Members who have signed up to this democratic process, will abide by the people's final decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500036#NN00300","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516896600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Ireland is changing.  When I was growing up, the Catholic Church was the predominant institution.  For young people today, that institution is greatly weakened.

Social issues that dominated the country for so long, such as divorce and gay marriage, have become commonly accepted.<\/p>  <p>  In the 35 years since the referendum, women were shamed terribly by the State and the church.  The history of those 35 years has been barbaric and an affront to women's health and rights.  There has been a litany of abject failures that have imprisoned women and let women die for the sake of religious and political fundamentalism.  The movement for choice is as powerful as it ever was.  Women will no longer tolerate the hypocrisy of being second class citizens in this State.  This movement has largely never been able to challenge the Constitution in respect of a constitutional right to choice.  It has been a prisoner of that concept.<\/p>  <p>  Those who trivialise and demonise a woman's right to choose ultimately do not trust women to choose.  I trust women to make the decision on what is right for them and their families.  Only women can make that choice.

If that sounds outlandish, in the North women in possession of abortion pills and people who prescribe them can be dragged through the courts and sent to jail.  That is absolutely barbaric.<\/p>  <p>  The eighth amendment belongs to the past.  A woman's right to choose belongs to the present and the future.  I appeal to those who are yet to decide.

It is time to give women and citizens a chance to make that decision on our Constitution.  The party I represent has a proud history of representing women and this issue.  It is an issue that can be divisive, but it is time for this generation to make the decision and have a referendum once and for all on giving women the right to choose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500038#PP00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1516896600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I find it incredibly difficult to speak about this subject.  It is important when speaking about it not to hurt or offend anybody, and I will try to speak in a way that does not do that.  I have been an elected representative for a long time.  One thing I have always tried to do is not judge anybody on anything they have done.  All of us have experience of people coming to our constituency clinics who are condemned by the world for their actions.  I have always tried, and I do not claim to have always succeeded, to leave judgment outside the door and try to assist another human being.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that nobody would engage in the innuendo that people are taking a stand on this issue to get votes.  I do a great deal of work for Travellers and I guarantee that it is not a great vote getter.  I have tried to assist all the disability groups over my years in politics.  As some people know, I have done a great deal for prisoners, not only those in prison due to the Troubles, but also to help the families of people in prison who have been convicted of other crimes.  I have been criticised for doing so.  I do not mind.  It is not popular.  However, I believe no human being on the earth is beyond consideration and assistance irrespective of what they have done in the past.  In anything I say, therefore, I am not making a judgment on anybody.  Regardless of the circumstances in which a person comes to me, I respect the person's confidentiality and make no judgment.  There is a saying in Irish, N&iacute;l a fhios ag aon duine c&aacute; lu&iacute;onn an bhr&oacute;g ar an duine eile, which means one never knows where the shoe is laid.  Time and again that saying has struck me in my career.<\/p>  <p>  There is one thing on which there is probably general agreement across the House, and it is something I could never understand when the then Minister, Senator Reilly, introduced the Protection of Human Life During Pregnancy Bill, and that is the outrageous possible penalties in that legislation.  I accept it is unlikely they would ever be imposed on a woman, but the fact that those outrageous penalties were in the law was wrong.<\/p><p>No constitutional change is needed to amend that Act and put an end to the possibility of a woman who procures an abortion receiving a sentence of 14 years' imprisonment.  Such a possibility is both an abomination and totally wrong.  I agree that severe penalties are required for those who provide illegal abortions because such procedures put women's lives and health at risk.<\/p> <p> On this issue, like in all debates, each side could conclude it is right.  Those on the pro-life side would say that the eighth amendment has saved a considerable number of lives.  The nub of the issue is whether we accept that an unborn child is a human being.  As a public representative, I have been grappling with that over the past 20 years or so.  If we do not accept it, the issue should be resolved in favour of the pro-choice side.  However, if we do accept it, we must consider the principle, which is very dear to me, as a public representative, of not countenancing the taking of any life as legal.  That is the nub of the issue and for people to dismiss it is unfair.  My knowledge and reason tells me that a 20-week-old baby in the womb, although being nurtured by its mother, is an independent human being.  The day of the elimination of the law permitting capital punishment was one of the best in my time in politics.  When I was first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, there was a law under which a person could be executed for killing a garda.  We have moved on and the Constitution now prohibits the death penalty.  I have never agreed that the State should have the right to take a life in those circumstances, although some argued that such people had done terrible things.  The dilemma is that if I believe and know and all scientific evidence indicates that an unborn child is a human being, why is no consideration being given to the position of such a child?  As Maolra Seoighe said from the gallows, \"T&aacute; m&eacute; chomh neamhchiontach leis an leanbh sa mbroinn\"; \"I am as innocent as a child in the womb.\"  The Members present in the House would find it difficult to believe that in an unborn state they were not themselves.<\/p> <p> I know children and I have grandchildren.  It is amazing that children often display character traits which they carry with them throughout their lives on the day they are born.  I hope that, at least, those in favour of repeal and abortion understand our problem and dilemma and that we are not hard-hearted.  Like all Members present, I wish there was an easy answer to this issue.  I wish we were not in a situation whereby the burden and challenge of this problem seem to weigh more heavily on one sex than the other, although I do not accept that men do not have a role to play.  In some cases, men, for their own selfish interests and possibly because of embarrassment, have persuaded women to get abortions.  Therefore, to leave men out of this is to take from them a responsibility that is rightly theirs because it takes two to bring a child into the world.<\/p> <p> I am hugely concerned by deaths in our maternal hospitals.  There were three reports on the Savita Halappanavar case and they concluded that her death was due to mistreatment of sepsis that should earlier have been diagnosed.  A case recently came to public notice involving a woman who died during an operation on an ectopic pregnancy, which is a very common operation that has been performed in our hospitals for generations.  That case deserves as much examination, questioning and remedying as any other in terms of how that was allowed to happen.  The outrage of anybody dying in our hospitals in a way that could have been avoided is inexcusable and must be dealt with.<\/p> <p> I hope this debate will lead to our being willing to put far more money into two issues: disability, which can arise after or before one is born, and maternity hospitals, such that they can provide the best care in the world and keep up with improving standards.  All Members know of children with life-limiting conditions.  Some have children close to them with that diagnosis.  Because of modern medicine, parents may be given devastating news before a child is born about many things that might not be life-limiting in terms of the duration of the child's life but would be permanently life-constraining.  It must be horrendous to be given such a diagnosis.  In its wisdom, the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution recommended that such diagnoses not be grounds for abortion.  To say it is not absolutely devastating news is not to face reality.  We should put far more care, money and support into assisting such parents.  The issues of perinatal hospice care and disability must be addressed.   Every day, many people face the challenges of looking after parents or children with a disability and fighting with the State for very fundamental things.<\/p> <p> By its nature, a referendum is a binary choice.  In this case, the choice will be whether to leave in place Article 40.3.3&deg;, which protects human life.  I have never had any problem with any medical intervention undertaken in good faith to save a mother's life.  I have always believed that anybody who holds back in that regard is wrong.  Alternatively, should we take away the constitutional protection afforded by Article 40.3.3&deg; and leave such decisions to the Oireachtas?<\/p><p>What the Oireachtas might do then will be a matter for the Oireachtas and it will not be confined to the proposals of the committee.  All the referendum will say, if it succeeds, is that it is then up to these Houses.<br\/><br\/>I believe that in reality, if we go down the route of life limiting conditions, doctors will find it very hard to make that judgment.  Many of the arguments put forward in favour of the referendum will not be dealt with by the proposals in the committee's report.  There is much talk of the fact that 3,000 to 3,500 women go to Britain each year.  Looking at the statistics, I believe that the numbers of women who travel to Britain for the reasons of fatal foetal abnormality or a life limiting condition are a tiny fraction of the overall numbers who travel.  The women who travel there because the baby has been diagnosed with a serious disability are relatively small.  I believe that the vast majority go because they want an abortion for social and other reasons.  This means that there are people rationalising about where this journey is going.  These people know that we are on a journey.  There are Members of the D&aacute;il or organisations such as Repealeight who want abortion totally on the same terms as Britain <i>de facto<\/i>- not <i>de jure <\/i>- and they say that nothing else is going to stop the flow.  The argument that a proposed referendum will stop the flow does not stand up.  Unfortunately, the way we are going about this means that inexorably this will happen.  The report shows us this.  When we see what some committee members are proposing we see the direction they want to bring us.  They will have an in.  Once it is decided that the child in the womb is not a child or a human to be protected there is an inescapable logic and rationale to where it is going, because who are we to make the choice and to limit the decision between one child and another?<br\/><br\/>I believe that any talk about proposed legislation is not what we are actually asking the people.  We are asking the people if they want to leave it open to what I consider to be an inevitable journey and to equalise our law with Britain or any other liberal country, or we are asking the people if they want to stay where we are and see how we can provide better services and protect that fundamental human right.  It is not easy and there is no perfect answer.  I do not pretend to have a perfect answer.  We live in a very imperfect world with great sorrow, great sadness and difficulty in it.  I hear people talk about moral superiority of the current generation over the past generations.  I sometimes wonder when I hear societal attitudes to some of the problems of the people I deal with.  People 50 years ago had the same superior view of the structure of their society.  They thought they had cracked the past and that people who lived 50 years before them had been totally out of fashion.  I can guarantee the House one thing: in 50 years' time people will wonder how could we have left so much wrong in the 2010-30 period.  They will wonder how we could have been so cruel to so many people.  Day in and day out I feel we are living in a very uncaring State.  I could tell stories but it would break confidences I have with people.  People are being treated in an utterly harrowing way by the State at this time.<br\/><br\/>Because I believe the unborn child is just that - an unborn child who is fully a human being - this referendum will be the first time ever that a referendum will be introduced to take a fundamental human right to life away from so many.  If one does not accept that the child is a human then that is fair enough, but if one does accept it then we have a massive dilemma.  I will come down on the side of protecting human life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500038#PP00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516897800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The issue of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution needs to be approached with great care and sensitivity.  I thank Senator Noone and the members of the committee for their efforts.  I appreciate their task was an extremely difficult and arduous one.<\/p>  <p>  From the beginning it was clear that whatever the recommendations the committee proposed they would cause division on a topic that has been debated numerous times in the Houses of Oireachtas and throughout the land over the past 35 years.  I remember that these debates often turned nasty and caused people to behave in an undignified manner and to say things which were better left unsaid.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of this debate, I ask that people engage in an honest, open and respectful way, without casting judgment on others.  As other Members have already stated, it is important we all recognise that fundamentally this is a deeply personal issue, and it is a matter for each citizen to decide what he or she believes is right and correct.  It is important that all of us are non-judgmental in this regard and that we respect the views and opinions of others.  I sincerely hope the debate over the next months will be conducted along these lines.  On this occasion, I hope we can approach the issue on a somewhat higher level and with an element of maturity that was not there on previous occasions.<\/p>  <p>  Pregnancy and birth and the issues surrounding it are extremely complex.  When legislators in the past tried to enact legislation to deal with them it proved extremely difficult and divisive.  If it were simple and straightforward, we would not be in the situation we are now in.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the complexities of the issues involved and the choices that will inevitably face us at the ballot box, it behoves all of us to take time to reflect deeply and to think matters through before we speak, especially before we lecture others on what they should or should not do.  Anyone who says this is a simple, straightforward matter is foolish in the extreme and the public should ignore such propagandists, whether they are elected public representatives or representatives of some bipartisan organisation.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Members I too have spent some time considering the recommendations of the committee.  I did not find this an easy task.  I have listened to the many arguments and discussions over the past weeks.  With regard to the actual recommendations before us I am firmly of the view that they go too far.  I do not support unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks and I will uphold this view in the upcoming debate.<\/p><p>For me, it is a step too far and I cannot support it.  Like all Members, I will have further opportunity to give detailed response and comment when the Government makes decisions and brings proposals before the Oireachtas for consideration and decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500040#RR00200","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516898400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is a difficult, emotive and personal issue for everyone, both in this Chamber and outside.  I speak on the issue as both a representative of a number of different views on the part of my constituents and as a parent, husband, son and brother.  Where a number of different views are articulated, we get a good cross-section of people's opinions on this sensitive issue.  It is important that we have mutual respect for each other's opposing views.  While I may not agree with or accept it, I respect everyone's opinion on this and every issue.  I hope the same respect will be afforded to me here this evening.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate, it is also important that we reflect on, remember and consider carefully the mother and the unborn baby.  In many contributions in this House, the unborn baby was not spoken about as much as it should be.  I think that is a mistake because it is real and it needs that level of respect and discussion.  There is another dimension, which is the family unit.  In some cases, a father or a husband will be involved as well and it is important that all those set ups are encompassed in the discussion.  It is also important to remember that there are mothers listening to this debate who have had terminations for one reason or another.  We do not want to cause them any further anguish, upset or annoyance during this debate.  We must be respectful and mindful of that also.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult for Members, as legislators, and those outside the House to have a proper debate on the proposed change to the Constitution in the absence of a proposal.  In essence, we are talking in a vacuum because we do not have the proper information in front of us.  To some degree, that gives an idea of the complexities involved in the issue.  Everyone is struggling with what are the appropriate proposals to be considered.  It is, therefore, difficult to discuss the detail of a referendum when we do not know what we are actually discussing.  We must also remember that the current amendment, protecting the life of the unborn, has served the State well.  It has served to protect the life of the unborn very well in the past and now.<\/p>  <p>  I am not so sure of the legitimacy of the term \"fatal foetal abnormality\" and whether it is just a foetal abnormality.  That is, I suppose, for another day and for others to discuss.  I have engaged with families that have made it their business to see me at my weekly clinics, at my office or outside of that.  They have made contact with me in recent weeks and months and have told me numerous stories.  These are stories that we have all heard.  However, in some cases, the medical advice given to them years ago was that the baby would not survive outside the mother's womb.  If termination had been available at the time, the baby might well have been terminated.  However, that was not an option available to them in Ireland, thankfully, and it was not an option that was sought.  As a result, the baby was born and has matured to adulthood.  As a family unit, they have enjoyed and still enjoy their time with that person despite being given such bleak, sad and bad news following scans during the pregnancy.  This is feedback from families, mothers and fathers who have experienced this situation.  The undercurrent in their message is that medical professionals are human and sometimes they, like everyone else, can get it wrong.  That is hugely important to bear in mind.  As a result of taking the right decision, lots of people have enjoyed a fulfilling life to the best of their ability, whatever that may be.  No one should deprive any individual of that right.  It is important that the correct supports and services be in place for both the mother and the family unit should they get such bad news when they attend for the different scans during pregnancy.  If we are honest, those services do not exist properly at the moment.  The supports are not there.  This needs to be considered further but I will return to it later.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that we are not selective when quoting medical professionals.  I have heard medical professionals quoted quite a lot on both sides of the debate.  Yet, when these medical professionals have made recommendations on other important health issues, by and large they have been ignored or not taken on board.  I met a senior surgeon a year ago.  He was looking for &euro;4 million investment in Tallaght hospital to allow patients to be treated properly.  At the moment, they are regarded as being critical.  This would allow them to operate normally on a daily basis.  They are waiting two years as critical patients for surgery.  Those senior surgeons and consultants have advocated to Government on that investment, but it has not happened.  Then there is the other side of the coin which we heard earlier today.  Other medical professionals came out and advocated strongly in respect of the children's hospital and they would say that, by and large, they were ignored.  We must be measured in our approach and our discussion.  We must also be measured when we are quoting professionals.  I believe in quoting them but they should be quoted honestly, fairly and consistently.  People should not be opportunistic or selective.  The concern is that we are selectively quoting parts to suit an argument but this is too sensitive an issue to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Where a pregnancy is ended and a baby aborted under the heading \"fatal foetal abnormality\", what are we trying to achieve?  Are we looking for something perfect or ideal that we know will never exist?  We must realise and understand that everyone has a right to exist in society irrespective of who they are.  I firmly believe that it is not about anyone's disability but everyone's ability.  We must put that centre stage.  Irrespective of the circumstances into which a person is born, it is important that the services, supports and assistance are there.  The love of the family unit and surrounding people will be there.  Everyone can have a fulfilling and enjoyable life.  That is what is important and it is incumbent on us to ensure that that right remains.<\/p>  <p>  Others issues discussed include rape and incest.  These are terrible, awful and inhumane acts to attempt to inflict on any woman.  Those found guilty of such acts should get the toughest sentence possible.  The acts in question are wrong.  I have listened to women who have attended Leinster House to make presentations and to women outside it who have contacted me and sought meetings.<\/p><p>I can only repeat what they are saying to me, which was that while a terrible act was brought upon them, having gone through an abortion was equally difficult for them to deal with it.  The termination was not, in essence, any solution for them as they ended up with two significant traumas to deal with in life.  One was the terrible, inhumane act that was the rape or incest, which nobody would attempt to condone, and the other was the aborting of the baby.  We must remember that in this difficult discussion, the baby who is terminated or who somebody is contemplating terminating, has no say in it.  The child, the mother and the family unit, if it happens to the mother there, should get the relevant supports and the services should be provided to allow the child to be born.  The child might have been conceived in a way it would not want to be but it had no control over that and it deserves a right to play a role in society.  We must be conscious of and reflect on this point.<\/p> <p> We all recognise that services and supports are not adequate at present for the mother, the unborn baby or the family unit.  I will not play politics on any issue, as I believe in trying to progress things to get positive outcomes, but adequate services are not available at present.  They are lacking in number of different areas of the health service, some of which I discussed in a Topical Issue debate with the Minister.  The people to whom I have spoken say it is not a case of funding but delivery on the ground.  We must be humane and compassionate in this regard and must ensure the appropriate services are put in place to help families, particularly mothers, in these dreadfully difficult circumstances and to assist them.  This, in turn, will assist the unborn baby.  That baby has a right and we must speak up on its behalf.<\/p> <p> It will come as no surprise to Members that I confirm I am absolutely pro-life.  This is my own personal view and that of those people I represent to my constituency.  I acknowledge and respect that my colleague who is present and others in my constituency have different views but based on those people who have contacted my office by telephone, text, Facebook or email, three out of four have asked me to advocate on a pro-life basis.  It is hugely important that we protect the life of the unborn in the proposals that are put forward in the time ahead of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500041#SS00200","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516899000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Are there any other speakers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500042#TT00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1516899000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I seek clarification.

I was only acting on the request of one of the members of my Rural Independent Group who wanted to speak.  He had to go to a funeral this evening in County Meath and said he would come back.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to speak on this most important topic.  We have certainly seen some interesting developments in the past week, particularly with reference to the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to which I used to belong at one time.  While I respect his right to have a personal view on this matter it seems extraordinary for a leader to call for a respectful debate and then proceed to disrespect the majority of those at his own Ard-Fheis and his parliamentary party.  He also called for a non-divisive debate but in the same breath seems to have split his own party.  These are certainly strange times.<\/p>  <p>  I have sat here and listened to the contributions other Deputies have made, and that is why I did not want to speak until late into the debate.  As a member of the committee I said I would sit here throughout the debate, and I did, until it concluded.  Some speakers have been nothing short of contemptuous and sectarian in a manner that would not have been out of place in the most bigoted loyalist diatribe of 50 years ago.  Thankfully, most of us have moved on from such bitter and blatant hatred masquerading as compassion.  Others continued to parrot the worst stereotypes about the Catholic Church at the same time as they managed to completely avoid what this debate is really about.<\/p>  <p>  What I have found to be truly disturbing, and indeed chilling, however, is the total lack of reference to the unborn child.  Speeches that went on for over ten minutes managed to avoid all reference to the reality of the child in the womb.  That was incredible.  We are here debating whether we will permit the intentional destruction of an innocent child's life up to the first three months of its existence and yet we will not face that fact.  However, it is a fact that must be faced.  It is a brutal fact that what we are now proposing is that for any reason whatsoever, a child's life may be ended up to 12 weeks.  Can anyone explain to me the rationale for 12 weeks?  Why not 13 weeks or 20 weeks?  We must face up to what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  Much of what I have to say has been outlined in the minority report I, along with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael and Senator Ron&aacute;n Mullen, an Independent, issued prior to the Christmas recess.  To my mind, the committee has produced what may have been seen as the most dangerous and extreme set of proposals ever formulated in terms of attacking the fundamental right to life of the unborn child.  From the outset, it was clear the preference among the majority of the committee members for the repeal of the eighth amendment and the legalisation of abortion in this State had the potential to obstruct the proper fulfilment by the committee of the mandate given to it by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  It was stressed to the committee that the mandate given to it by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad was to consider the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and that, therefore, there should be an opportunity to consider in detail the approach taken by the Citizens' Assembly to its work and the strengths and weaknesses in that regard.  There was little support for this among the committee members and the view of the minority group was that the majority wished only to examine how the main thrust of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommendations should be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  In our view, the Chairperson had a duty to remind the committee, notwithstanding the various personal views of members, of the need to ensure a thorough consideration of issues given that the vital issues of justice, human rights and personal welfare were at stake.  We are disappointed that this did not happen at any stage.  Instead, much was made by the Chairperson and other members of the need to avoid repeating the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  We believe that this revealed a troubling mindset.  It was more of a priority to deliver a report by 20 December, without too much inconvenience to members, than to thoroughly consider questions on which lives would depend in future. Yet, despite this desire to avoid repeating the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the committee later saw fit to embark on a question which was, at most, only tangentially dealt with by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, namely, the question of whether abortion should be decriminalised.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of not wanting to repeat the work of the Assembly, the consensus was that the committee would not hear from advocacy groups, but mainly from experts.  We opposed this exclusion but, to our surprise and disappointment, the committee went on to invite numerous well-funded international pro-abortion advocacy groups and abortion providers.  The only pro-life group invited was One Day More, and that was to present the other side of the arguments presented by the group Termination for Medical Reasons.<\/p>  <p>  The extraordinary imbalance in the list of invited guests in favour of abortion was a problem from the start, which was pointed out by pro-life members.  This problem arose because the abortion-supporting majority on the committee did not see it as necessary or desirable to hear expert testimony on issues such as the human rights case for the eighth amendment, seen from the perspective of the Irish State having regard to the current provisions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann; whether, as has been claimed, the eighth amendment has contributed to Ireland having a significantly lower than average abortion rate compared to abortion jurisdictions and to the saving of thousands of lives as a result, I believe up to 5,000 per year, since it was inserted in the Constitution at the will of the people; the experiences of families who believed that the lives of some of their loved ones had been saved by the eighth amendment; and the evolution of an abortion culture in countries where abortion had been legalised.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the manifest majority in favour of legalised abortion among committee members, pro-life members made it clear at all times that it was not the job of us in the pro-life minority to secure a list of experts who would ensure that all issues were examined thoroughly.  That was the responsibility of the Chairperson, Senator Noone, supported by the secretariat, and we believe this responsibility was not met by any yardstick.  Nonetheless, several names were proposed by us.  Some of these were rejected, contributing further to the imbalance in the perspectives presented.<\/p>  <p>  Any independent analysis of the invited speakers and the recommendations that they made shows a clear ideological preference for legalised abortion among the vast majority.  This applies also in the case of some invited speakers who spoke from a position of medical expertise but who did not confine themselves to providing expert evidence and instead offered personal opinions that went far beyond the scope of their expertise.<\/p>  <p>  Despite concerns expressed repeatedly by the three pro-life members, there was not sufficient time allowed to properly examine invited speakers-committee witnesses.  This concern was never accepted by the Chairperson and there was never any proposal to extend the time available for questioning.  That was all the more of a problem because of the strong tendency of invited witnesses to support legalised abortion.  The allocation of extra minutes occasionally and on a grace-and-favour basis cannot be considered as an acceptable resolution of the problem given the profound importance of the issues at stake.<\/p>  <p>  When the committee pre-emptively voted to recommend that the eighth amendment be removed or changed, and I mean pre-emptively - everybody could see that - without waiting to hear from all the invited speakers, much less to hear from a balanced ticket of speakers, this confirmed that the link between the evidence being heard and the conclusions the committee would reach would be, at best, loose.  I pointed out that it was like a court case where somebody was on trial - it could be anybody - and after hearing only half the evidence the jury foreman approaches the justice and says, \"We have heard enough; we will give our result now\".<\/p>  <p>  The committee&rsquo;s decision to vote pre-emptively has been defended repeatedly by the Chairperson despite its being an objectively hasty, ill-considered and prejudicial move.  We believe that is unfortunate.  It was only when pro-life members drew public attention to the biased attitudes and processes within the committee that the Chair, backed by the secretariat, made belated attempts to invite a small number of pro-life voices.  It should be noted that the number of such people by then proposed was small and tokenistic and would in no way rectify the imbalance complained of.  It is significant that one of the speakers the committee invited was a person who had earlier been proposed by me but rejected.  The committee did not choose to hear from him at first but, in the light of criticisms of the lack of balance, an effort to secure his participation was now under way.  We believed this was revealing.<\/p>  <p>  A second belated invitee, the group Both Lives Matter, had previously offered to appear before the committee after its work in highlighting the number of abortions prevented as a result of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s more restrictive laws had been discussed briefly at the committee.  This group&rsquo;s offer was declined on the basis that advocacy groups were supposedly not being invited, despite pro-abortion advocacy groups like the Irish Family Planning Association, the New York based Center for Reproductive Rights, and the largest abortion provider in the United Kingdom, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, being invited.<\/p><p>However, the group was later invited after public attention was drawn to the imbalance among invitees.  It is not surprising that the small number of pro-life groups invited belatedly to give evidence declined to do so.  From their correspondence with the committee, it was clear they felt they were being used to give token respectability to a process which had already jumped ahead to decide on critical issues.  We cannot disagree with their view of the situation.  In fact, I and others attempted to have the letters they wrote to the committee read into the record, but that was denied by the Chairman.  Hearing what they had to say was denied.<br\/><br\/>I have a note on a case to which I was very close.  It is important that we recognise the fact that Ireland has one of the lowest maternal mortality rates and is one of the safest places in the world to give birth.  It is important that we do not confuse unfortunate medical failings with the lifesaving eighth amendment, which strives to protect both lives.  Women&rsquo;s lives are saved from complicated and emergency pregnancy situations day in and day out in our maternity hospitals.  Women receive all the treatment necessary to save their lives, including the termination of pregnancy if required.  The only difference is that the aim of the eighth is to save both lives.  Four years ago today, my own daughter&rsquo;s life was saved when her pregnancy became complicated by severe pre-eclampsia.  Thankfully, my granddaughter, Amy-Berry, was delivered, ten weeks early.  My granddaughter almost lost her life as a result of being delivered so early but thankfully both lives were saved.  It is a story which demonstrates precisely the aim of the eighth amendment.  I wish my granddaughter a very happy and peaceful birthday.  I thank the medical and maternity staff of South Tipperary General Hospital and Cork University Hospital and salute staff all over the country for the gallant work they do in these situations every day.<br\/><br\/>In view of the failure of the committee to consider certain issues and the partial nature of the evidence heard on other issues, we have chosen to give a fuller treatment to issues not fully considered by the committee.  We recommend the retention of the eighth amendment on the grounds that it protects both mother and unborn child, does not endanger top quality medical care for women and unborn children in pregnancy and is consistent with the best standards in the protection of human rights and human dignity.  In the last few weeks, there has been much talk and apparently a lot of sincere concern about one recommendation of the committee in particular.  I refer to the so-called &quot;12 week limit without restriction as to reason&quot; which was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il members and then accepted by the majority of the members.  This was despite the fact that the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis voted overwhelmingly a week earlier to retain the eighth amendment and not to undermine the right to life that it guarantees.<br\/><br\/>There is one thing that must be made absolutely clear: all of the debate about what will and what will not be acceptable in a post repeal scenario is a complete and utter distraction from the main point.  I emphasise that.  If the repeal of the eighth amendment happens, albeit I do not believe it will, there will be absolutely nothing to stop the Oireachtas in any future iteration from introducing as permissive an abortion regime as it sees fit.  I have the privilege to have been elected to sit here currently and whoever is elected to a future Oireachtas will have the same privilege.  However, they will be able to introduce whatever legislation they see fit.  Only the power of the Constitution can prevent this State from descending into a situation like that of the UK where there is <i>de facto<\/i>abortion on demand and where 200,000 unborn children lose their lives each and every year.<br\/><br\/>It has been observed that a common argument put forward by those who advocate the repeal of the pro-life amendment is that the Constitution is no place to deal with the complexities of abortion.  Better by far to leave all of that to the wisdom of the Legislature, so the reasoning goes.  While not entirely unsurprising, the fact that this has generated a certain kind of credibility is quite bewildering.  It is a view that has been reiterated on several occasions.  As has also been noted:<\/p><blockquote>One can only wonder if any of those who advance this position have ever actually opened their copy of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann or even taken the time to acquaint themselves with the many other Amendments that now form part of its text. [An Taoiseach referred to some of these recently].  If they had done so they might perhaps, have been more circumspect in adopting the 'too complex for the Constitution' line.  What about children's rights?  [We had that referendum some years ago and legislation passed here, inserted in the Constitution].  There is now an explicit children's rights provision in the Constitution, even though the topic of children's rights is extremely complex. [It is very complex as any of us who have children or grandchildren know].  What all of this demonstrates is, and I quote &ldquo;not that abortion or the right to life is too complex for the constitution.  What it demonstrates is that it is the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; kind of complexity [for some of the people here].  By all means let us keep complex amendments that liberals like.  But by no means let us keep the Eighth [That is the hypocrisy and double standards].  That is the clear reasoning at work here.  Sure we can hold summits [the Taoiseach is in Davos], conduct pan-European debates, engage with the entire EU political class to canvass for a certain treaty outcome; but try and figure out how to keep or 'ratify' a fundamental human right in the Constitution?  Sorry, you're on your own, it's just too hard.  [A party I was involved with campaigned twice on treaties that were rejected].  In an appalling dereliction of duty, the Committee chose to cut the knot of complexity rather than make any attempt to unfold it in a life affirming manner. [That is my belief, that it decided to cut the knot of complexity rather than make any attempt to unfold it in a life-affirming manner, sadly].  It is a lazy parliamentary hubris masquerading as serious critique.<\/blockquote><p>As our minority report puts it:<\/p><blockquote>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is the basic legal text of the Irish State, within which all fundamental rights are protected, such as the freedom of speech, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, the right to private property, the right to a fair trial, etc.  Constitutions are the correct place to secure and protect fundamental rights.<\/blockquote><p>It is time to call out the majority of committee members on their &quot;too complex for the Constitution&quot; line.<br\/><br\/>To return to a point I made earlier, but which I think needs repeating, the focus on the so-called &quot;12 week limit&quot; is utterly disingenuous and amounts to little more than a grotesque exercise in PR designed to obscure some of the more distasteful realities that the report recommends.  For example, while the committee report in its section dealing with foetal abnormalities did not technically recommend that the law should provide for the termination of pregnancy on the ground that the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality, or what I call &quot;life-limiting condition&quot;, it nevertheless left the option for such terminations to occur on other grounds, such as those of a purported threat to the physical or mental health of the mother.  These recommendations have thus created a gaping legislative loophole that will directly permit the targeting of unborn children who have been diagnosed with severe life-limiting conditions at late gestational ages.  By their very nature, loopholes never explicitly mention the abusive purposes for which they can be used.  Recently, we had a budget debate on the Finance Bill.  No tax loophole, for example, ever says &quot;this way to tax avoidance&quot;.  The same is true here.<br\/><br\/>Submitting a human being's right to life to a democratic vote is to my mind the very opposite of genuine democracy.  It is, in point of fact, an utterly totalitarian impulse.  If we put even a fraction of the effort into trying to tease out the life saving benefits and possibilities of the eighth amendment that we have put into undermining it, we might not feel this great sense of inevitability about abortion.  The child in the womb cries out for our protection and our care.  The eighth amendment is a reflection of what an authentic human rights culture can look like.<\/p><p>We should not allow it to be tainted or destroyed by those who will not stop until every last protection for the unborn child is removed.  Is that really who we want to align ourselves with?<\/p> <p> There are many more aspects of this debate I could have mentioned, such as the total absence of gestational limits under mental health grounds in the report.  I have been asked not to say this but many Down's syndrome families have contacted me because of the stance taken by their CEO.  I could have mentioned the fact that 90% of Down's syndrome children in the UK are aborted or the fact that since the UK introduced its abortion law 50 years ago, a law which is mirrored in the report's recommendations, almost 9 million unborn lives have been lost.  Is that where we want to be in 50 years?  This is an opportunity to assert we will not tread that path, that we choose a culture of life, the life of both mother and baby, and that we will not rush headlong into a culture of death from which there can be no return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500045#WW00100","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>My job this evening was to wrap up the debate and there are no other speakers offering.

I believe I speak on behalf of tens of thousands of men and women throughout this country.  There is an attempt here to drag out the debate so we can then drag out the presentation of legislation before the House so that we can drag out the inevitability of a referendum on the eighth amendment.  At the beginning of this process, we made it very clear.  We stood up twice to object to the 20 minute speeches that were being allowed for every Deputy in the House.  We indicated we thought this might happen in an attempt to drag it out, filibuster and obfuscate and to pull it way down the road.  That is clearly what is happening.  I back up the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and his right to end the debate now.  This should die a natural death and not be put on a respiratory machine.  Normally that is what would happen.  The norm is being taken away from this reality.  The only case in which this would be allowed is in a case of this magnitude.  I put on record our absolute objection to the procedures that are being dragged out here.  When the Business Committee meets next week, I have no doubt this will be a very contentious issue.  I back up the Minister of State in his attempt to give a concluding speech.  He should be allowed to do so and that should be the end of the matter.  We have had 80 speakers in 17 hours, and it does not do anybody in this country any justice to drag this out any further.  We need to move on so that the young people of this country, in particular, get to have a vote on this on 25 May.  If we do not move on, we will deny that cohort a right to have a say over something that affects their future - not the Acting Chairman's, with all due respect, and certainly not mine, but theirs.  We have to keep that in mind when we make these decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY00900","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Sorry, Chair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01000","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":505,"content":"<p>No.  I will be-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01100","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I put my hand up before the last Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01200","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The Deputy should resume his seat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>No, sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>The Deputy should resume his seat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01600","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy in a second.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Before the last Deputy spoke-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500047#YY01800","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1516901700,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy.

I recognise that there are deeply held views on all sides of the Oireachtas and throughout the country.  In taking the next steps as a Parliament and as a Government, we must respect and hear them all.  That is what most people have said here.<\/p>  <p>  It is most important that we accept that no matter what divides us, we are united in wanting to do what is right.  Everyone wants to do what they think is right.  Some have changed their views over the years and some bear scars from past debates.  This time, I think and hope it is possible for us to have a respectful debate on the issue.  That is how it has been until now.  It will require everyone's attention but it is crucial that everyone has the chance to hear clearly the issues in this debate so that when, as a nation, we come to make the next decision on this issue, we make an informed one.  If the Oireachtas decides to hold a referendum, it will be the people who will make the final decision.  The people are sovereign.  <\/p>  <p>  As a country, we have a particularly complex past regarding the position that women have held in the State.  Abortion was made a felony in 1861 under the Offences Against the Person Act.  In more recent decades, it has been an issue dominated by referendums and court cases.  The first referendum was held in 1983, and there was another in 1992 with three questions.  Legislation followed that in 1995, and a third referendum on abortion was held in 2002, seeking to overturn the ruling in the X case, but it was defeated.  In 2013, the issue came before the Oireachtas when it passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  Since the passing of that law, there has been a clear legal basis for abortion in Ireland but it has become clear that this Oireachtas can go no further without constitutional change and the people having their say.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the substance of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I commend all members of that committee on their work and thank them for their contributions.  I thank Senator Catherine Noone in particular for her plain and balanced handling of the issue as Chairman.  I also commend the Chair of the Citizens' Assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, and its members for their careful deliberations and acknowledge their valuable contribution.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that the recommendations contained in the committee's report represent the views of the majority of members of the committee but there was not unanimous agreement on them.  I respect the views of those who dissent from the recommendations but I believe the recommendations are the basis on which the Government will proceed.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas to ultimately decide.<\/p>  <p>  The main conclusion of the committee is that change is needed to extend the grounds for lawful termination of pregnancy in the State.  In order to effect that change, the committee recommended that Article 40.3.3&deg; should be removed from the Constitution.  The committee then went on to make recommendations on the grounds on which the termination of pregnancy should be permitted in Ireland if Article 40.3.3&deg; was repealed.  It recommended extending the law on abortion to cover cases where the health of a woman was concerned, cases of fatal foetal abnormalities and a broader legal regime that allows abortions where a woman seeks it from her medical practitioner for pregnancies of under 12 weeks' gestation.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is working with officials and the Attorney General to consider how best to translate these recommendations into legislation should that be the wish of the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  While it is understandable that focus has been on the committee's recommendations on the eighth amendment, the committee did not only make recommendations on the termination of pregnancy, but also on the services and supports that should be available to women.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that all women accessing maternity services should receive the same standard of safe, high-quality care.  Every woman, from every corner of Ireland, should expect and be able to access the maternity services that she needs.  I am confident that through the implementation of the national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, the quality outcomes envisaged by the committee will be realised.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer has now established a group to address and formulate an effective and comprehensive response to the issues raised by the committee in its ancillary recommendations.  We have made other progress which provides the basis for delivering the kind of integrated care that women and their children deserve.  We have established the national women and infants health programme, and we now have HIQA standards for safer, better maternity services and new HSE national standards for bereavement care to ensure clinical and counselling services are in place to support all women and families in all pregnancy loss situations.  The HSE's Positive Options crisis pregnancy counselling service is also available in 50 centres nationwide.  These other recommendations are very important and we should take cognisance of them.<\/p>  <p>  I realise that this issue challenges all of us.  It causes us to ask difficult questions of ourselves and makes us uncomfortable as we collectively wrestle with what, at its core, is a very personal, private matter for many people.  As the debate concludes, the Minister for Health will return to Government shortly with a series of proposals to facilitate a referendum on the issue by the end of May or early June, should that be the decision of this Oireachtas.  Over the past two weeks of statements on this issue we have shown that a constructive debate is possible and I hope that we can continue such a debate in an atmosphere of respect for each others' views if the decision of this Oireachtas is to hold a referendum.<\/p>  <p>  These may be the concluding remarks on these statements, or if others come in in a few weeks or months time, another set of concluding remarks may be required.  In any case, that is the Government's position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500048#ZZ02200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1516902900,"counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500049#AAA00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","time":1516902900,"counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500049#AAA00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1516902900,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for being here.  I appreciate it.  I flagged this issue of traffic in College Green as far back as the summer of 2017, and previously, in the context of a directly-elected mayor of the city, that the role of director of transport for Dublin would be a function that would form part of a directly-elected mayor's office.  We have discovered, subsequently, with the introduction of the Luas cross city, which I wholeheartedly welcome and which is a considerable asset to the city, that the College Green area is a significant pinch point in relation to traffic.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Luas cross city has seen it become a victim of its own success but the Minister will have to agree that it is also a victim of horrendously poor forward planning.  As an ordinary citizen, as a layman, I have been able to see the kind of challenges that the city would face pending the introduction of the Luas cross city and there does not seem to have been any significant forward planning, in terms of modelling to understand the kind of numbers that Luas cross city would take up and in terms of its impact on bus users, car drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.  I wonder how come this was not envisaged because it has left a glaring gap.  What has happened is that all the authorities within the city, the National Transportation Authority, NTA, Dublin Bus along with Luas cross city, and Dublin City Council, are now reacting, as is always the case in this country, in particular, in regard to Dublin, and are trying to plan their way out of what has become a chaotic and congested city and suburbs.<\/p>  <p>  Last year my Private Members' motion calling for a Dublin city traffic advisory council was passed unanimously by the D&aacute;il but there has been no movement on this.  That was guaranteed to give every stakeholder in Dublin an input into traffic management and the design of traffic solutions in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The city clearly needs, and this College Green issue has highlighted it, a director of transport and an office of director of traffic to set out plans and to help address congestion from the suburbs, for example, from my own constituency, Ballycullen, Knocklyon and Scholarstown, right into the city and the College Green area.  The absence of a directly-elected mayor feeds into that, in spite of the fact the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, promised that the city, if Dublin so decided in a plebiscite, would get to directly-elected mayor to coincide with the local elections due in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, as far as Dubliners are concerned, there is no vision for traffic management in the county or in the city.  There is no vision for how trams, buses, cars, commercial vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians are to share the public space that we all, in various shapes and forms, use and absolutely no plan for and no input from those with disabilities or special needs.<\/p>  <p>  The College Green area involves specific challenges.  Three hundred buses an hour at peak time, or 3,000 buses a day, use College Green.  The NTA and Dublin Bus announced certain changes to 17 routes, redirecting them around by either Westland Row or Tara Street, and that the NTA will give additional priority to buses on Tara Street, and I cautiously welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  We will have to wait and see what the ultimate impact will be on the west of the city, but what will we do with the quays?  For example, some mornings it takes 40 minutes to get from Heuston Station to O'Connell Street and it is quicker for those who use the bus to get off at O'Connell Street and walk rather than to wait for the bus to bring them to Dawson Street.  There is a huge problem crying out there.<\/p>  <p>  There are pedestrians facing significant delays crossing at major traffic pinch points.  While there may be some offering as a solution, I, as Dublin spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, have highlighted this issue going back a year.<\/p>  <p>  This is also in anticipation of when longer the Luas trams come into operation.  As the Minister well knows, those longer Luas trams, while they will bring a welcome increase in capacity as the existing trams accommodate 320 passengers and the longer trams will accommodate 380, will cause significant pinch points at O'Connell Bridge and in other areas.  I do not see any plans to anticipate what might address the problems that will be caused by the additional length of the Luas cross city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500049#AAA00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1516902900,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I fully acknowledge the problems which Deputy Lahart has put is finger on and I am grateful to him for doing this.  It is right that he should do so.  In acknowledging it, the Deputy also pointed out the considerable success of the Luas cross city and the fact that it is in enormous demand.<\/p>  <p>  As well as that, the Deputy said something which I thought was significant when he was talking about the number of buses that have been put on to try to remedy some of the problems and the changes that have to be made because of Luas cross city.  The Deputy stated that we will have to await the impact of them to see whether they are successful or not.  He is right.  We will.  When we introduce very significant changes, as we have done on the Luas cross city and with other major changes, there are always some impacts which one cannot completely anticipate, in terms of pedestrians' habits in terms of their familiarisation and how they will behave when changes such as this are introduced, and one cannot except to have a massive benefit of the sort that Luas cross city and the additional 10 million journeys a year that will be taken as a result provides, without it having teething problems, and those are being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  One never achieves absolute perfection when one introduces reform.  We will not achieve absolute perfection when we introduce a major benefit to the city, to public transport and to the travelling public here.  I admit readily that the problems which the Deputy has pointed out are there but let me say this.  As they emerge, they are being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, what Deputy Lahart calls the victim of its own success, Luas cross city, has, in fact, attracted an enormous number of people and the remedy for that, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, is that additional trams will be purchased, trams will be lengthened and we will see if that suffices to resolve the problem of over capacity.  The problems of success are the problems we are talking about here and those problems are being and will be addressed seriously.  However, the benefits of its success are more substantial.  We will respond to both of these particular features of what has happened because of the introduction of the Luas.<\/p>  <p>  The new line has placed an increased demand on the capacity of the College Green area, as the Deputy has pointed out, to cater for the volume of vehicles seeking to travel through this area and I am aware of the congestion issues which have been causing delays to some commuters during peak periods.  The introduction of a completely new tram service in to Dublin city centre obviously requires a period of bedding in while all road users get familiar with, and adjust to, the new trams travelling on the central streets.  We are not denying the problems the Deputy has pointed out.  We are saying we are addressing them but that they are the problems of success.<\/p>  <p>  Car drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, cyclists and pedestrians all have to acclimatise to the new street environment and the new traffic layouts.  Teething difficulties are to be expected while that familiarisation process takes place.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there is a proposal currently under consideration by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a civic plaza at College Green to help relieve traffic congestion in the area.  In the interim, the National Transport Authority has undertaken consultations with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council on measures that could be undertaken to facilitate the more effective movement of traffic through College Green in advance of the determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the College Green plaza proposals.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA announced this afternoon the outcome of these consultations which involves a number of changes to Dublin Bus routes in the College Green-College Street area.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The purpose of these changes is to reduce the number of buses passing through these streets and enable the more effective operation of this area.  Therefore, from next week a number of Dublin Bus routes which currently travel through College Street and Westmoreland Street will instead be rerouted via Tara Street and Burgh Quay.  None of the stop locations on these routes will change, so bus passengers will be unaffected.  Also from next week, a number of limited stop services, known as X services, will be assigned to alternatives routes and removed from the College Green area.  Some other routes will be assigned to other alignments.  Details of the exact rerouting will be provided at the relevant bus stops and on the Transport for Ireland and Dublin Bus websites.  The combined impact of the above two changes will reduce the number of Dublin Bus vehicles travelling through College Green by approximately 20%.  This reduced volume will enable the traffic signalling system and junctions in this area to operate more effectively.<\/p> <p> I am informed by the NTA that it is intended to monitor the above changes after their implementation to confirm they achieve the intended outcome.  Following this review, should a further reduction in the number of vehicles travelling through this area become necessary, a number of other measures will be considered for implementation.  I am confident that these initiatives will go a long way towards alleviating the congestion issues at College Green.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500049#AAA00300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516903500,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He talks about the benefits of the success of the Luas cross city.  Those benefits do not spread out to constituents of mine in Ballycullen, Scholarstown and Knocklyon because we are sandwiched between the red and green lines.  That is a matter for another day but it is of significant and equal urgency.  The Minister said the relevant authorities \"are reacting\".  That is exactly what the Government is doing.  It reacts and addresses the problems as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  I am just a Joe Soap, an ordinary citizen.  When the longer Luas trams are introduced, they will cross O'Connell Bridge every three minutes.  Because they must clear the bridge, since they are longer than it, as the Minister knows, it will take between 55 seconds and 90 seconds for the Luas to cross O'Connell Bridge.  If it takes a full 90 seconds to cross the bridge.  That leaves one and a half minutes for all the traffic on both sides of the quays - including buses, which will have priority along with bicycles - to make its movements either across O'Connell Bridge or down the other side of the quays.  That is even before private cars get to move.  I therefore predict - I wish it were not so - that well in advance of 31 March, when longer Luas cross city trams are introduced, there will be chaos along the Dublin quays.  This chaos is stretching right back and having a consequential impact on traffic coming from the suburbs north, south and west.  Therefore, that the Minister says the authorities \"are reacting\" once problems arise is the very kernel of the issue.<\/p>  <p>  One need not be a rocket scientist to have predicted that the success of Luas cross city, which I absolutely acknowledge, would have significant knock-on effects on pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, car users and buses.  This simply does not seem to have been anticipated by the people who make plans for this city.  This is before we even mention the chronic traffic congestion and gridlock building up on the M50, in the suburbs and in places such as I mentioned because of a chronic shortage of bus services in some cases, as in Ballycullen, Scholarstown, Knocklyon and other such areas.  The situation cries out for forward planning, which is why I mention the Dublin transport advisory council.  Given the fact that the Minister's Government has stated it will be six years before we get to consider a directly elected mayor, a director of traffic for Dublin, both city and the county, is very seriously and badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500050#BBB00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1516903500,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I will not be repetitive but I will tell the Deputy that we acknowledge the problems he pointed out.

We were told at the time by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/p><blockquote>I want to assure the House that IAG has confirmed that existing employment rights of the employees of Aer Lingus will be fully safeguarded upon completion of the offer ... Aer Lingus will engage in a process of consultation governed by agreed structures with staff and its representatives when any restructuring is required and ... it does not foresee a likelihood of either compulsory redundancy or non-direct employment.<\/blockquote><p>That vision has not come to pass, sadly, because the reality, as I warned at the time, has been the opposite.<\/p><p>On Thursday, 16 November of last year, 20 staff members of Aer Lingus's guest relations were summoned to a meeting in Aer Lingus's head office.  They were told it was a business briefing and that they did not need union representation.  Despite this, they were told at that meeting that their jobs would be outsourced to North America from the end of February.  This has been the strategy under way since 2015.  In February 2016, the procurement department was outsourced to Poland, with the loss of 15 jobs.  IT was then outsourced to India and the UK, part of the finance department has been outsourced to India, and now guest relations is going to North America, while most customer relations work has already been outsourced to Manila in the Philippines.  On top of this, there are very serious rumblings about the outsourcing of catering and ground operations.  We know operations such as Menzies Aviation are waiting on the sidelines to franchise the operation that is there.  We are also informed initiatives are taking place in this regard, with no guarantees for the jobs or conditions of the workers there.  Bad and all as that is, on top of that, the Aer Lingus chief operating officer told staff of the need to cut costs because of Norwegian Air and WOW Air.  If that was not enough, Aer Lingus has come up with its own low-cost airline level which it is using to threaten workers with their own jobs and conditions.  Aer Lingus claims it will set up a new company to compete with itself.  You could not make this stuff up.  It is an absolute race to the bottom.<\/p><p>We cannot go into the details of the case, but the Minister may be aware that groups of workers in guest relations at Aer Lingus have a respect and bullying case before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, next month.<\/p><p>The point is that very serious push factors are under way in respect of working conditions.  Overnight, the employment conditions of 20 workers in that section, some of whom have been there for decades, went from a five-day roster to a seven-day roster.  The only day off guaranteed is Christmas Day.  Their conditions have been stood on their head without any meaningful engagement whatsoever.  Then, advertisements are placed for jobs to be outsourced and they are gone.  It is absolutely traumatic for these workers.<\/p> <p> I suppose the issue revolves around what the Minister can do.  In some ways, he is the Minister who has arrived after the product has been sold and our national airline hived off.  I presume, however, that, in the context of the guarantees given by his predecessor to the House - and the utter failure of Aer Lingus to honour them - he has a role to play in the context of intervening urgently with IAG to stop it undermining and pushing workers out of decent jobs and working conditions and to stop outsourcing jobs to outside the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500050#BBB04900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516904100,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Clare Daly for bringing this matter to my attention.  The aviation sector has been an important employer in Ireland for many years.  It supports 26,000 jobs directly and a further 16,000 in the supply chain.  Ireland's tourism industry, which is heavily dependent on aviation, accounts for a further 180,000 jobs.  Aer Lingus itself, now a fully privately-owned airline within the lAG group, employs in the region of 4,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of the takeover offer, IAG anticipated that, under its ownership, there would be significant job creation opportunities in Aer Lingus's business, predominantly located in Ireland, with net employment growth   However, in the context of the Deputy's reference to promises made by lAG regarding jobs, I would like to make a number of clarifications.  The legally-binding commitments made by IAG as part of its offer for Aer Lingus relate to Heathrow slots, the location of the headquarters and the Aer Lingus brand.  These commitments from IAG are enshrined in Aer Lingus's articles and are enforced via the single Aer Lingus share retained in the name of the Minster for Finance.  At no point did IAG make legally-binding commitments to the Government on Aer Lingus jobs as part of its offer.  Furthermore, the Government has no role in making or seeking commitments regarding employment in private companies.<\/p>  <p>   The role of the Government at the time was to accept the offer from lAG and to accept the conditions under which the Minister for Finance would retain a single share in the company.  My functions, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on Aer Lingus, are now essentially the same as with any Irish airline.<\/p>  <p>  Any statements made by the companies at the time of the offer concerning growth, jobs, new routes and industrial relations would all be regarded as forward-looking in nature.  Such statements were made in good faith by IAG and were based on the available information at the time.  However, I reiterate that such statements were never presented by the companies concerned or by the Government at the time as promises.<\/p>  <p>  Having clarified this matter, I can state that since IAG's takeover, Aer Lingus's business has progressed broadly in line with the plans outlined in the offer documentation.  In terms of passenger growth and new routes, the company has outperformed what was envisaged at the time of the offer.  For example, the offer envisaged two additional transatlantic routes in 2016, whereas three were launched, with a further new service to Miami announced in 2017 and new services to Philadelphia and Seattle announced for 2018.  Aer Lingus now offers direct connections between Ireland and 13 major North American airports, and the significant part of this growth has occurred post the 2015 acquisition of Aer Lingus by lAG.<\/p>  <p>  While matters concerning workforce planning are entirely for the company, one would expect that the significant growth in Aer Lingus's passenger numbers, routes and fleet has resulted in a net increase in employment in the company.  In this context, it is noted that Aer Lingus recently announced that, since its introduction in 2014, its new strategy created more than 600 new jobs to the end of 2017.  It was also announced that the airline will add eight new Airbus A321 long-range aircraft to the fleet.  It is understood that this expansion will see the airline add approximately 800 new jobs between 2019 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the increased connectivity provided by Aer Lingus, particularly in the transatlantic market, which has positive knock-on effects for employment at our airports and in the tourism sector and the wider trading economy.  In particular, the stand-out tourism statistic for recent years has been the rapid increase in the number of tourists visiting Ireland from North America, which increased by more than 15% again last year.  The commitment and investment which IAG has made, through Aer Lingus's transatlantic services and the growth of Dublin Airport as a transit hub for such services, has certainly helped facilitate this growth in the number of tourists to Ireland from that market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500051#CCC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516904100,"counter":624,"content":"<p>This is an incredibly important discussion, not least for the people whose livelihoods have been jeopardised.

At the time, the chief executive, Stephen Kavanagh, said he did not foresee compulsory redundancies or the use of outsourcing at Aer Lingus.<\/p>  <p>  From the moment the deal was done, outsourcing escalated.  A new job is not an additional job.  There have been new jobs created at the expense of existing jobs, not to mind that when we take in all the jobs that have been lost it does not compensate.  When we take the expansion of the routes and service, and the proportionate increase in workers coinciding with that, the sums do not add up because the work is being done on the shoulders of outsourced providers on much lower terms and conditions of employment.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be a role for the Government somewhere to say that a company which used to be a semi-State company actively using push factors - and deliberately orchestrating conditions and changing people's long-accepted work practices - is really, in essence, driving people out of their jobs.  For those jobs to end up in India, the Philippines and North America is utterly tragic for what was a beacon service and company in our area.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is right that the airport is a key employer.  We must ask what type of employer it is, however.  We have to stop the rot and this race to the bottom.  I put it to the Minister that it is private, but it is private because it was sold on the basis of lies and commitments.  The door is open for the Minister to go back and say that we do not think it is acceptable for anybody in our aviation sector to treat people in the way that those in the guest relations department and other departments are being treated.  Not only that, the company should be engaging with its staff and should not be going down the road of outsourcing in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500051#CCC00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1516904100,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I understand what the Deputy is saying.  When I was in opposition and this deal was taking place, I would have had views which were sympathetic to hers at the time.  We are now in a situation where Aer Lingus is a private company, and the managing director to whom the Deputy referred, Stephen Kavanagh, said he did not foresee any outsourcing when he was taking over.  We have to take that as a statement of good faith at the time, but it is not binding as we know, and commercial companies of this sort are no longer semi-State companies.  To ask me now to intervene in the activities of a private company, which is acting perfectly within the law, and which is of great benefit for many other jobs, is unrealistic and the Deputy will accept that.  Whereas I agree with the sentiment, legally I am not in a position to do anything in the way of a direct intervention.

The position in respect of Cashel is that many people in Tipperary are baffled and bewildered as to why we have a magnificent building, on which the HSE spent &euro;20 million since 2007 and which is under-utilised.<\/p><p>We have three floors that are empty that could take 30 to 35 beds.  They are in excellent condition.  I am asking that the unit be re-opened and developed as a primary and community care centre.  It is lying idle, which is shameful, and it is mind-boggling that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is not getting on with utilising the building to its maximum potential.<\/p> <p> Since the last election, I have focused much of my attention on ensuring this unit can be properly utilised in the interests of delivering health care in Tipperary.  We have had numerous meetings about it and the Minister, Deputy Harris, visited the hospital.  He said he was bewildered by the fact that the unit was not being used to its full extent.  He committed to establishing a working group within the HSE to consider ways and means as to how best to avail of facilities in the interests of the patient public in Tipperary.  The HSE has since carried out a thorough evaluation of the necessary structures and supports to enable Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel to function as a day hospital and community care centre with particular emphasis on the medical needs of older people.<\/p> <p> The HSE must accept that utilising community hospital facilities to support and care for non-acute patients is the way forward.  In Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, we have an ideal and top of the range facility that is there to care for patients and, in particular, people who do not need intensive and acute support.  I have discussed this with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on numerous occasions.  I ask the Minister opposite, who speaks on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Government to outline the plans for the future of the hospital.  We have been waiting in expectation of a response to our queries for a considerable period.  A number of weeks ago, the Minister told me he would be in a position shortly to make a decision so I hope the Minister opposite will be able to communicate that decision to me this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500051#CCC01100","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516904700,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this matter.  I apologise to the Deputy as the Minister of State with responsibility for older people is not present but I will convey the Deputy's remarks to him.  I will also convey the remarks to the senior Minister.  I am well aware of the Deputy's long interest in this hospital in Cashel.  I seem to be on the opposite side from people from Tipperary all week but I hope I will be able to give the Deputy a satisfactory answer on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Cashel, was originally part of acute health service delivery in the south Tipperary area.  In 2007, the former South Eastern Health Board decided that acute hospital services for the area should be centralised on one site, that being South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel.  This led in turn to the redevelopment, over two phases, of the former Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital into Cashel health campus, a centre for non-acute health care services.  There is, however, a compelling need to develop hospital avoidance and early discharge facilities in south Tipperary, particularly for the growing elderly population.  That is why the HSE is focused on developing a range of diverse primary care and community-oriented services to best serve the people of Cashel and surrounding areas.<\/p>  <p>  The services range from those operating on a 24-hour day, seven days a week basis to those that use the facility as a base to provide care in peoples' homes and communities.  The health care professionals based in Cashel health campus provide services across a number of care groups to the population of Cashel and surrounding areas.  The community intervention team located on the campus is a nurse-led professional team that provides nursing care to patients in a community setting.  The service provides high-quality nursing care in the community for a short period by working together with patients, carers and other professionals.  Thanks to the provision of this service, many patients can return to their homes earlier from hospital.  It also provides GPs with another option of care within the community as an alternative to the acute hospital.  Additionally, HSE community services provide support for people who are at home via the primary care team and home support services, which are based in Cashel health campus.  These services continue to have a significant role in supporting older adults who are discharged from hospital with ongoing non-acute care needs and in preventing admission to hospital.<\/p>  <p>  As part of winter funding measures for 2018 and 2019 introduced to improve access to unscheduled care, &euro;450,000 has been approved by the HSE to further develop community services for older people in south Tipperary.  This follows the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Harris, on a visit to Tipperary in September to a 40-bed modular extension to South Tipperary General Hospital and his support for a day hospital at Cashel.  That was at the invitation of the Deputy.  I know the Minister would wish to acknowledge Deputy Lowry's advocacy on this matter and the use of Cashel, and indeed he accompanied the Minister on his visit there.  Discussions are planned for the development of further initiatives, working in an integrated way with South Tipperary General Hospital and existing community services, which will provide a continuum of care for the local population, with particular emphasis on the provision of a model of care pathway for older people in line with the integrated care programme for older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500052#DDD00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1516904700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I welcome that an additional &euro;450,000 is included by the Health Service Executive for the funding in 2018 and 2019.  I am sure it will contribute to the enhancement of services, particularly for older people in south Tipperary.  I also welcome that consultation and discussions have been taking place with consultants and key personnel in the general hospital in Clonmel with a view to outsourcing some of the services currently being delivered from there.  As the Minister is aware, there is a problem in Clonmel with overcrowding and that is compounded with the number of people attending clinic consultations at the general hospital there.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to Tipperary and to resolving the problems we have at South Tipperary General Hospital.  A new 40-bed unit has gone to tender and other measures include a community intervention team to be based at Cashel.  The reality is we have a unit in Cashel that is modern and vacant and that should be fully utilised for the benefit of patients on waiting lists or who encounter delays at outpatient clinics at Clonmel.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to re-opening Cashel and I hope the ongoing discussions can be completed in the short term.  This building has for many years been associated with the delivery of health care in Tipperary and I hope it can be fully re-opened so the people of Tipperary can utilise it to its maximum potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500052#DDD00300","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1516904700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I once again take the opportunity to apologise on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly, and acknowledge the case made by the Deputy.

This certainly comes into that category.  I will certainly convey everything the Deputy has said to both the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, who has a particular interest in this hospital.<\/p><p>The Minister and the HSE recognise that Cashel health campus is vital for the provision of community based services that help people to stay in their communities and homes and that assist those people who require emergency department hospital admission to be discharged as early as possible from acute care back to their home environment.  While the campus is being used for day and primary care services, the additional funding provided this year as part of the winter measures to improve access to unscheduled care will form a basis to allow local services to further develop an action plan for a range of services to support older people in the south Tipperary area.  This will help both to avoid hospital admission in the first instance and also to facilitate early discharge should a stay in an acute hospital be necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500052#DDD00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516905300,"counter":639,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.30 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 January 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
