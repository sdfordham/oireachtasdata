It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked.  In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.   The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory body that regulates medicines available in Ireland.  I am advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the IMB &ndash; Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline &ndash; can all have significant side effects.  To assert that any one is automatically a more effective or safer alternative to the others is a grossly misleading oversimplification.  Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised that the Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  <\/p><p>  Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p><p>  Up to September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use and was not an option as the usual duration of deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months.  The 28-day limit was removed in September 2012.  However, there is limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone usage for longer periods.  The position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps.<\/p><p>  The Minister had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>On 1st   July 2013, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and Roche Products (Ireland) issued a letter to all GP&rsquo;s concerning Lariam.  This letter has been circulated by the Director of the Defence Forces Medical Corps (DMC) to all Medical Officers. The DMC is considering its content and whether or not it has policy implications. Lariam remains licensed by the IMB and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800045#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reserve Review","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800045#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[35933\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800045#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the measures he is implementing to ensure rural Reserve Defence Forces outposts are maintained.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The re-organisation of the Reserve Defence Force is a key element of the response to the findings and recommendations of a Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force.

He is endeavouring to get the agreement of both sides for a structure for talks and for confidence building measures on the ground to help the parties domestically, and especially the Palestinian side, to enter the process.

This could include direct encouragement and support for the parties, EU actions to help build confidence on the ground and support in our political contacts with the US for what the Administration is doing on the Middle East.

Obviously, any prospects for a successful conference require the clear commitment of both the Syrian government and opposition to fully support the Geneva II initiative and engage constructively in it.

In addition to the ten individuals already deployed with EU civilian CSDP Missions, Ireland deployed three further people to EU CSDP Missions in the first half of 2013.  The Missions involved were in Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan), Georgia (EUMM Georgia) and the regional maritime training mission in the Horn of Africa and the Western Indian Ocean (EUCAP Nestor).<\/p><p>  We also sought to support the work of the High Representative in preparing for the European Council discussion on defence issues in December by hosting a series of informal meetings at Ministerial and official level.  We cooperated with the European Parliament and the European External Action Service in the organisation of a conference on the role of the EU as peacemaker and mediator.  A seminar on cooperation between e regional organisations and the UN in the areas of crisis management, peace support and peace enforcement operations was organised under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Defence.  These meetings allowed member States to exchange views on how to strengthen CSDP and how to improve the availability of the required military capabilities for international crisis management.  I hope that the outcome of these discussions will assist the High Representative in developing proposals and actions on which she is due to report in September.<\/p><p>  Work undertaken during our Presidency on developing a new set of Crisis Management Procedures aimed at streamlining the process of planning and deploying CSDP Missions in the future is close to finalisation.

It was to alleviate those concerns that the Parades Commission was established under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 with independent and quasi-judicial status.  I recognise that certain Parades Commission determinations are controversial but that is inevitable given the nature of its role.  In the absence of political and local agreement in Northern Ireland to resolve contentious parades, a regulatory mechanism is essential in this area.<\/p><p>  Last year the Commission dealt with over 4,000 parade related applications, of which it made determinations on 146 contentious parades.  As a quasi-judicial public body the Commission's activities do not fall within the agreed areas of co-operation addressed by the North South Ministerial Council.  Successive Irish Government have fully supported the Commission in its difficult work and have consistently called for its legally binding determinations to be respected and upheld. <\/p><p>  I have been in contact with Secretary of State Villiers and Minister Ford over the weekend in relation to the deplorable violence which broke out after the 12th of July parade in Belfast.  I have expressed the Irish Government's appreciation to Minister Ford for the work of the PSNI in protecting communities from this violence in very difficult circumstances.  The attacks on the police which have led to over sixty arrests and over seventy officers being injured are unacceptable and shameful.   <\/p><p>  The determinations of the Parades Commission are legally binding and respect for the rule of law must be upheld.  The Secretary of State and I are at one in our commitment and determination to uphold the law, support the police and the further development of the process of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  I will be meeting with Secretary of State Villiers next week to further discuss parades and other issues of concern.<\/p><p>  I welcome the initiative on the part of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to set up an all party group under the chairmanship of Dr Richard Haass to consider a number of outstanding issues in relation to the peace process and parading is one of those.

The Government follows closely reports of human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners, including reported cases of organ harvesting, and is concerned about the situation.  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a range of issues, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.  At this meeting, the EU also asked about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, which it signed in 1998. <\/p><p>  In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.  During this meeting the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU was discussed.  Officials in my Department met again with representatives of the Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers on 9 July regarding the issue of organ harvesting.  A Common Position adopted by the European Council in 2008 outlines that Member States shall deny an export licence to any company if there is a clear risk that military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression.  <\/p><p>  In Ireland, human trafficking for the purpose of the removal of organs is criminalised under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  In addition, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that the removal of human organs without consent or for payment is an offence under the European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations 2012 - S.I. No. 325 of 2012.  These Regulations give effect to Directive 2010\/53\/EU.  Under the Regulations, it is an offence to traffic, harbour, import or export organs contrary to the Regulations and the Directive.  The Regulations set out a framework encompassing the establishment of competent authorities, the authorisation of transplantation centres and the establishment of conditions of procurement and systems of traceability.  I understand that the Department of Health is also preparing legislative proposals for a Human Tissue Bill which will set out a detailed consent framework for the removal, donation and use of organs from deceased and living persons for the purpose of transplantation.    <\/p><p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, including those related to the Falun Gong, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels, including at the United Nations Universal Periodic Review of human rights in China, scheduled for October 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade and Investment Development","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[36301\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on the workings of the Export Trade Council, including the number of meetings it has held, the decisions made, and funding commitments allocated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Directive also provided that the ongoing effects of its implementation be monitored by the European Commission.  Following a number of studies on the Directive&rsquo;s effects, in October 2012 the Commission published a proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive.  The Commission included a proposal that foodcrop-based biofuels should, at most, comprise half of the 10% quota required to come from renewable energy sources.  This proposal, in conjunction with the incentives for advanced (next-generation) biofuels, signals the desire of the Commission to move towards the use of advanced biofuels made from feedstocks which do not compete with the production of food.  While Member States agree that the issue must be addressed, it remains an extremely complex matter, and agreement has not yet been reached on the 5% cap.

To estimate the potential yield from a Stamp Duty on probate, one would need to identify the value of all estates in probate, which is not possible from the data available at present.  I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, that probate is a legal process whereby a grant of representation is issued by the High Court Probate Office or District Probate Registry in respect of a deceased person's estate.  The grant of representation gives legal authority to a person or persons to access the estate and administer it in accordance with the law.  The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.<\/p><p>  Where a Grant of Representation in a deceased person&rsquo;s estate is extracted, it is subject to a Court Fee.  The Court Fee in question is calculated in accordance with the Supreme and High Court (Fees) Order (S.I. 239 of 2013) and is assessed on the basis of the value of the net estate of the deceased person.  The Courts Service has advised that in 2012 fees of &euro;1,860,967 were collected in respect of applications to the High Court Probate Office for Grants of Probate and administration.  Details of the fee income collected in the 14 District Probate Registries are not readily available.<\/p><p>  A Probate Tax on estates was introduced by Finance Act 1993.  The tax treated the estate of a deceased person as an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators of the estate.  The net estate &ndash; that is, the assets of the deceased valued at the date of death, less liabilities at the date of death and reasonable funeral expenses &ndash; was deemed to be an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators.  The rate of Probate Tax applied to the net estate was 2%.  One of the main difficulties with Probate Tax was that it had to be paid prior to the grant of probate or administration.  As funds in an estate cannot be released until after the grant, the imposition of probate tax placed a severe cash-flow burden on executors or administrators of estates who, if other funds were not available, had to arrange borrowings to discharge the liability.  In many cases, this caused hardship for estates that had no liquid assets and where sales of property took time.  Probate Tax was abolished by Finance Act 2001.<\/p><p>  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) was introduced in 1976 and includes both gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT is an acquisitions tax that imposes a tax charge on individuals after they receive gifts or inheritances.  The charge arises at a time when the person is in a position to pay the CAT on the gift or on the inheritance, because s\/he is in possession of the benefit received.  CAT is therefore considered a more appropriate form of taxation of inheritances.  I do not intend to reintroduce a Probate Tax on estates or a Stamp Duty on probate.  However the Deputies may be aware that the rate of CAT on inheritances has been increased from 20% in 1999 to the current rate of 33%, and the tax-free thresholds have been considerably reduced since 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[35989\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a non-means tested State pension is fully exempt from the universal social charge; if the non-means tested State pension was subject to a USC, the amount it would realise for the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1093","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>The position is that the Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.    Payments that are made under the Social Welfare Acts are and have always been specifically excluded from liability to USC. Accordingly, all State contributory and non-contributory pensions are exempt from the charge.  I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that certain payments, which are of a similar character to social welfare payments, are also exempt from universal social charge. A list of such payments is included at Appendix A, page 49, of the FAQs relating to the universal social charge published by the Revenue Commissioners and available at http:\/\/www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax\/usc\/universal-social-charge-faqs.pdf.<\/p><p>  To estimate the potential yield from applying the USC to non-means tested State Pensions i.e. the contributory State Pension and the State Pension (Transition) it would be necessary to identify certain details in respect of each recipient of social protection payments such as the individual amount of these payments received, the amount of any other income potentially liable to USC, the age of each individual and whether there was an entitlement to a medical card etc.  This information would be essential to determine what rate of USC would apply at an individual level.  It is possible that in many cases the rate would be low. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they do hold or have access to the required information set out above, there is no basis on which an estimate of the yield from the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.  However, by way of illustration, if for example, a 1 per cent levy was imposed on social protection contributory State Pensions and the State Pension (Transition) the full year yield to the Exchequer would be &euro;41 million on the basis that the estimated provision for such payments in 2013 is approximately &euro;4.1 billion. The estimate of Exchequer yield assumes that there is no exemption threshold, allowance or personal reliefs that could be used to offset against the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[35991\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the 24 safety deposit boxes remaining in Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, if owners have been identified for them all; the length of time each box was with either Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide; the gross value of the remaining contents; the period of time after which the contents come into the ownership of IBRC or the State; if any safety deposit boxes have gone missing; and the value of any contents that went missing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This package is designed to help put the Greek economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing.  This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention.  <\/p><p>  One of the measures agreed in November, the Securities Market Programme (SMP) measure, will see Member States pass on, to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Member States under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality, and must be seen in the context of the very significant debt restructuring that has taken place in the Greek programme. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country close to exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. <\/p><p>  We have, during 2013, returned to the international debt markets.

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.   There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no such single internationally agreed methodology to calculate the effective rate of corporation tax, there is no reliable basis upon which to calculate the current 'effective rate' of corporate tax in Ireland without being potentially misleading.  <\/p><p>  Therefore, neither I, nor my Department, would be in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.<\/p><p>  To illustrate the debate on the topic, I have previously referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013<\/i>).  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but they do indicate that the 'effective' rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is already much higher than the 6% minimum 'effective' rate the Deputy suggests.<\/p><p>  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  <\/p><p>  We therefore have only a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focused firstly, on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The small number of reliefs we have include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[36055\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of additional revenue increasing capital gains tax to 40% in budget 2014 would yield for the Exchequer.

Revenue currently operates two purpose-built patrol craft (Revenue Customs Cutters), RCC &quot;SUIRBH&Eacute;IR&quot; in service since 2004 and RCC &quot;FAIRE&quot; in service since 2009.  Both craft, operated by appropriately qualified officers from Revenue's Customs service, are capable of extended patrols right around the Irish Coastline and adjacent waters.  The primary aim of coastal activity is to prevent, detect and deter smuggling and illegal importation of controlled drugs and other goods.  It involves co-operation between land-based Revenue and Garda&iacute;, the Maritime Unit and the Navy, and of course international authorities.  The Revenue Maritime Unit completes the range of responses now regarded as standard in international anti-smuggling activities.  <\/p><p>  Regarding recent activity, for operational reasons specific details of the Cutter activities is not made public.   <\/p><p>  The range of cutter activities mirrors that of land based customs officers and includes:<\/p><p>- Patrol of the external frontier to outer limits of Territorial Sea (12 mile limit).<\/p><p>- Monitoring (overt &amp;amp; covert) all vessel movements - Assess, Board, Rummage as required.<\/p><p>- Enforcement of import and export prohibitions and restrictions.<\/p><p>- Identification and securing of outstanding VAT\/duty liability on pleasure craft.<\/p><p>- Information\/Intelligence management.<\/p><p>- International anti-smuggling operations at sea.<\/p><p>- Managing and monitoring maritime information systems . <\/p><p>- Servicing national and international M.O.U.s and Mutual Assistance requests.<\/p><p>- Supporting national anti-smuggling operations.<\/p><p>- Developing and servicing coastal contacts (Customs Drugs Watch Programme).<\/p><p>- eParticipating in marine search &amp;amp; rescue.<\/p><p>  Cutter operations are risk-led, so they tend to be most often deployed where intelligence suggests a need, either on their own or in conjunction with other national and international agencies.  It is also important however to ensure that there is a visible presence in all parts of the country, and cutters are based in Dublin, East Coast, and North West for extended periods as well as in their &quot;home&quot; base in the South West - traditionally the highest risk area for transatlantic drug smuggling.  In addition, the cutters participate in a limited number of public events and maritime festivals to build public awareness of the Customs Drugs Watch programme.<\/p><p>  Each cutter has a crew of six, and is at sea for more then 200 days per annum, with 24\/7\/365 availability.  Each cutter carries a rigid inflatable (RIB) which can be launched at sea to enable boarding.  They are also equipped with the latest radar, satellite monitoring and communications equipment, and have constant access to Revenue and other enforcement agency databases.  <\/p><p>  As an island nation the provision of customs cutters to police our maritime frontiers is regarded as an essential investment.  The cost and adequacy of the present level of provision is continually reviewed.

These persons paid a total of &euro;2,319,768 in domicile levy for that tax year.  The year 2011 is the latest year for which figures are available.  Domicile Levy returns for the year 2011 were due by 31 October 2012 or 15 November 2012 (for ROS electronic filers).  This represents an increase of &euro;674,439 in the total amount of levy paid and four to the number of persons who have paid the levy since figures were last provided to the House on foot of Parliamentary Question 51696 of 2012, from Deputy Nash,<b><\/b>regarding the Domicile Levy on 21 November 2012.  Based on figures available to that date in 2012, ten persons had submitted returns declaring a liability in respect of the Domicile Levy for the tax year 2011 and had paid a total of &euro;1,645,329.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are currently undertaking a compliance programme on the Domicile Levy.  Inquiries are being made in a number of cases where a Domicile Levy return has not been filed and the person concerned has been identified by Revenue as having a possible requirement to file such a return.  Where Revenue identifies a liability to the Domicile Levy that has not been paid, the full levy, interest and the appropriate penalty will be sought.  Initial Domicile Levy inquiries have issued to 33 persons.  This number should increase as the programme proceeds. <\/p><p>  As the Domicile Levy is a self-assessment tax, with the onus on the taxpayer to declare their liability, it is not possible for Revenue to provide any estimate of the total domicile levy yield if all persons liable to pay the levy were to pay in full.  However, following finalisation of the current compliance programme and depending on the level of non-compliance uncovered, it may be possible for Revenue to provide additional information and\/or estimates on the level of compliance with the levy.          <\/p><p>  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 13,093 persons filed income tax returns for 2011 and indicated they were non-resident for income tax purposes for that year.

They include, for example:<\/p><p>- Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but who retain their home here (their tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on their Irish home);<\/p><p>- foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments (including property) here;<\/p><p>- foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have acquired Irish tax residence for that period (for example, individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment) may retain an Irish tax liability, after ceasing to be resident, in respect of investments made in Ireland during their period of residence.<\/p><p>  Individuals who leave the State are not required to declare their reasons for leaving, on a tax return or any other document.  However, it is likely that a high proportion of non-residents who file Irish tax returns are or have become non-resident for reasons unrelated to taxation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[36155\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or officials in his Department have held discussions with EU or US regarding the United States of America and their participating in International Bank Account Number, IBAN, system; his views on whether the inclusion of the US in such a system would improve financial dealings for both consumers and business here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>Neither I nor officials in my department have held discussions in the recent past with either EU or US authorities in relation to the International Bank Account Number, (IBAN) and the United States position towards it.

The capturing of such non-disposal income was not a common feature prior to NAMA&rsquo;s acquisition of the loans and NAMA has undertaken significant steps to design and implement new structures so as to achieve this objective. NAMA measures its performance on the extent to which it captures such non-disposal income on an on-going basis and not wholly on the extent to which a debtor is in compliance with the terms of legacy loan facility arrangements which predated NAMA. Despite NAMA selling over &euro;8 billion of assets to date it has maintained its weighted average cash flow loan performance at a stable level each quarter at over 30%.   The Deputy may wish to refer to the NAMA Quarterly (Section 55) Report and Accounts  for Quarter 1 2013, which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday and which contain further detail on the performance of loans. The Section 55 Report and Accounts show a weighted average cash flow loan performance of 32%.  The Section 55 Report and Accounts show also that NAMA had generated cash receipts of &euro;11.2bn since inception to end-March 2013, of which &euro;7.2bn related to disposal activity and &euro;4bn to non-disposal and other income, mainly rental income.  These results are the most important measure of NAMA&rsquo;s performance and show the significant progress that it has made in its just over three years in existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-IMF Programme of Support Drawdowns","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[36343\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of loans drawn down to date under Ireland&rsquo;s EU\/IMF programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s EU\/IMF Programme will result in &euro;67.5 billion in loans from official lenders as follows:<\/p><p>- EFSF (&euro;17.7 billion)<\/p><p>- EFSM (&euro;22.5 billion)<\/p><p>- IMF (&euro;22.5 billion) and<\/p><p>- Bilateral loans of &euro;4.8 billion (United Kingdom: &euro;3.8 billion, Kingdom of Sweden: &euro;0.6 billion and Kingdom of Denmark: &euro;0.4 billion).<\/p><p>The IMF borrowings are provided under its Extended Fund Facility standard terms.

A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.

The purpose of the review is to assess the merits of creating a &ldquo;bad bank&rdquo; for some RBS assets and it is due to conclude in the autumn of 2013. The Chancellor made some references to Ulster Bank in the context of the future orientation of RBS in dealing with the future of the two UK banks in which the British Exchequer has a significant shareholding.  Last Friday, the UK Treasury announced the appointment of BlackRock Solutions as asset specialist advisor to the review.

Ulster Bank described itself as the number three player in the Republic of Ireland with 1.3m customers- 1.26 m Retail and 80,000 Corporate. It informed investors that it has a clear strategy to create a &lsquo;Really Good Bank&rsquo; whilst tackling legacy issues; it intends to deliver a smaller, lower cost and profitable bank. Ulster Bank confirmed that it is &lsquo;cautiously optimistic&rsquo; about the Irish market. Data published at the end of June show that, having returned to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of growth in 2012, with GDP expanding modestly by 0.2 per cent. Ulster Bank is correct in seeing that Ireland is a place where the banking sector can expect to achieve returns which are acceptable to investors. <\/p><p>  The recent successful launch by BlueBay Asset Management LLP (BlueBay) and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) of a new vehicle that will provide loans to larger SMEs and mid-sized businesses in Ireland also shows that positive sentiment has returned.

The Receiver collects rent from the tenant(s) and passes it to the bank, together with attending to any property related issues the tenant may have (in accordance with the Lease Agreement). The appointment of a Receiver should not negatively impact the tenant(s) as the Receiver effectively steps into the shoes of the landlord.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums. <\/p><p>  Based on certain assumptions the average annual industrial wage is estimated at about &euro;31,500 in 2012. As there is no general requirement for data on retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;31,500, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000. Furthermore, details of the marginal rate of income tax an individual would pay on a taxable lump sum pension payment in the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not available.<\/p><p>  Based on broad assumptions and an extrapolation of certain available data in relation to the public service, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;31,500 and over at the higher income tax rate of 41% could be about &euro;100 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  Similarly, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;80,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;20 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  Finally, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;100,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;10 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any new tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[36745\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money that would be raised in a full year by confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confine tax relief for the public service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1181","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate &mdash; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.

From next year, all assessed taxpayers, that is, taxpayers who are in the self-assessment system, will be liable to PRSI on their full incomes including rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings. <\/p><p>  I should point out that PRSI is a matter for the Department of Social Protection in the first instance.

The marginal rate for each of these levies was 6% and 5%, respectively, or 11% in total.  The marginal rate for the USC was 7%.  Taken in isolation the introduction of the USC, therefore, would have had the effect of reducing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners paying at those rates.  At the same time, the PRSI ceiling for PAYE taxpayers, which then stood at &euro;75,036, was abolished which had the result of increasing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers.  So the two changes - the introduction of the USC and the abolition of the PRSI ceiling-taken together meant that the marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged.<\/p><p>  In the case of the self-employed, the PRSI income ceiling for the self-employed had been abolished in Budget 2001.  Therefore, without further change, the introduction of the USC would have reduced the top marginal rate for these taxpayers by 4 percentage points and would have had the unintended effect of benefiting high earning self-employed income earners, resulting in some high earning self-employed income earners actually making a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.    <\/p><p>  To avoid the situation in which the top marginal rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged while self-employed taxpayers benefited from a reduction of that rate by 4 percentage points, two further changes were made.

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.<\/p><p>  At post primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from &euro;2,550 to &euro;10,065 for day pupils.<\/p><p>  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013.<\/p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.<\/p><p>  There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.<\/p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRO02750"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[35966\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding a grant application in respect of a school (details supplied) in Dublin 3; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>A major school building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe\/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.<\/p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision. The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.<\/p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations are considered on a case by case basis. Applications in this regard require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home. Therefore there is no maximum number of siblings that will be required to share home based tuition.<\/p><p>  Parents who are experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher have been advised to contact the officials dealing with their allocation as tutors with alternative qualifications and experience may be accepted in some instances, as has been the practice in previous years.

For the first time, sport will be a core component with a focus on grassroots activities, inclusivity and cooperation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Uniforms","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[36192\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will intervene in the case of a person (details supplied) who is due to commence first year secondary school in September, who has been told they will not be permitted to wear their Hijab on the school premises","asker":"1003","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.

In the 2012 Survey  of Schools: ICT in Education, which was carried out by European Schoolnet, on  behalf of the European Commission, the frequency of use of ICT in lessons was  examined. The survey showed that the use of ICT by teachers in Ireland is much  higher at all grades than the EU average. There are considerable more teachers  using ICT in more than 25% of lessons, which is above the EU average,  particularly at grades 4 (4th class) and 8 (2nd year post primary). The most  intense use is at grade 11 (5th year post primary) where nearly a third use ICT  with their students in more than 50% of lessons, higher than the EU average.  <\/p><p>  Further evidence of the use of ICT in teaching can be seen in the take up of  ICT training places. In 2012 13,500 teacher training places were taken up on  ICT related training.

These are detailed below. <\/p><p>  A 5-year School Investment Plan 2012-2016 announced on 9 March 2012, provides  for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5  billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance  needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement  initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works.  <\/p><p>  The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant  demographic changes have been identified.  There are 275 projects set out in  the Plan that are expected to proceed to construction over the duration of the  Plan - 106 new school buildings and 65 extensions at primary level; 43 new  school buildings and 49 extensions at second level, and 8 new special school  buildings and extensions at 4 further special schools   In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects to commence  construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December  2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence  construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan. <\/p><p>To ensure that accommodation is available when required, my Department has  initiated alternative methods of project delivery whereby responsibility for  planning and delivery of projects is devolved to Local Authorities, Education  and Training Boards, NDFA, OPW and directly to school authorities.  <\/p><p>  Following on from the success of the 2012 prefab replacement scheme which  provided funding for the replacement of over 458 prefab units, I recently  announced that a further 46 schools would be offered grants in 2013 to build  permanent accommodation to replace 115 prefabs, subject to the schools meeting  certain criteria. The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the  highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the development of an inventory of education infrastructure and  related community assets, my Department undertook a pilot study in five areas  in the country. The geographic areas included for the pilot study were Tuam,  Navan, Clonmel, Portlaoise, and part of Limerick City.  The research  information gathered from this pilot study was in a format compatible with  current Department information systems, such as the Geographic Information  System (GIS). This allows my Department to overlay the new information such as  site maps, floor plans and other data on to its current GIS mapping system.  It  is the intention that this expanded inventory data will now be developed on an  incremental basis at a national level.  <\/p><p>  In June 2011, I announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established up to  2017 to cater for increasing demographics across a number of locations. These  will include shared campus arrangements where appropriate and possible. Some  examples of campus arrangements include the campus development in Monaghan town  which provided a primary school, a gaelchol&aacute;iste and a further education  facility.

Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils. As part of the DEIS programme a total of &euro;69.1m is being provided to 665 primary schools supporting 100,595 pupils and some 930 additional teacher posts. This funding provides for Reduced Class Sizes; Home School Community Liaison Service; Support Teacher Project; DEIS and Book Grants to individual schools. DEIS Schools are also targeted for supports provided under the Department of Social Protection Schools Meals Programmes (&euro;34m) and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs School Completion Programme (&euro;26.4m). My Department continues to work to ensure that DEIS funding is used effectively. For example, it has recently provided guidelines on the appropriate use of DEIS grant funding in primary and post primary schools, emphasising a number of recommended activities such as at least 10% of DEIS grant to be allocated to Home School Community Liaison activities.<\/p><p>  Some of the additional DEIS grant may also be used to meet ancillary costs such as heating, lighting and other miscellaneous charges related to extended openings of school buildings remaining open to cater for clubs and after school activities. The 22 DEIS schools in Tallaght will receive &euro;0.715 million in DEIS grants in 2013\/14 school year. Schools have been given the autonomy to work within the guidelines for the appropriate use of DEIS funding and to decide how best to utilise DEIS resources, including the DEIS grant to achieve maximum benefits to the most at risk pupils in line with their DEIS Action Plans and addressing educational disadvantage. These guidelines, which issued in October 2012, now place emphasis on outcomes rather than being too prescriptive in relation to recommended activities and interventions.

Following discussion between Ryanair, CWT and the National Procurement Service, agreement was reached on a fixed one-way fare of &euro;49.99 for travel between Dublin and Brussels South Charleroi for the duration of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. The fare included government taxes and charges, but did not include fees for baggage or for extras such as reserved seating or priority boarding. This fare was subject to a 2% credit card fee. It could be booked either online or by telephone, with a &euro;6 administration fee per person per sector for bookings made by telephone. The agreement also allowed for one change to be made to a booked ticket to an alternative flight of the passenger&rsquo;s choice on the same route. Ryanair also committed to providing an Assistance Desk at both of the airports concerned for any assistance required by travellers availing of this fare. The agreement applied only to the Dublin - Brussels South Charleroi route. This special fare was available to all officials and Oireachtas members travelling to Brussels on official business during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. Other options available to travellers to Brussels are the Aer Lingus service between Dublin and Brussels Airport and the standard fares available from Ryanair. In planning journeys, travellers would take account of the suitability of flight times, having regard to the timing and duration of the relevant meetings in Brussels. A further factor to be considered by Departments\/Offices in choosing flights is the ground transport links from the particular airport regarding access and cost. For those officials whose work\/meetings schedule allowed them to use this route, the Ryanair offer provided value for money. As a result of Ryanair's offers, significant reductions were achieved in the average cost of flights to Brussels when compared with the same period in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Valuation Process","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[36061\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will list by urban rateable area, broken down by business type in tabular form the number of appeals to rate valuations received to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Valuation Office has been conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the Waterford rating authority areas (Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council) and in the Dublin City rating authority as part of its ongoing programme to revalue all such properties in the State. This has resulted in the issue of Proposed Valuation Certificates to the ratepayers in relation to their property. However this process is not yet complete in Waterford as a small batch of outstanding Certificates will issue shortly. Ratepayers may make representations to the Valuation Manager if they consider that the proposed valuation or any details contained in the Proposed Certificate are incorrect. The representation stage is currently under way and will not be complete for some time. Following the processing of the representations to the Valuation Manager, the Final Certificates of Valuation will be published on 31st December, 2013, when each ratepayer in Waterford and Dublin City will have a statutory right to make an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal if dissatisfied with the outcome of their representations. The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and the ratepayers of local authorities. Therefore, it will be early 2014, before the appeal stage is reached in respect of the Waterford and Dublin City rating authorities, accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed statistical information which the Deputy is seeking at this stage. Under the Valuation Act, 2001, there is also a right of internal appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation. However, legislative proposals are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas which would result in this appeal being removed. This is one of a number of legislative proposals set out in the Bill. However, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to determine how such proposals proceed or otherwise.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, three revaluations of commercial property have been carried out to-date in the rating authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and the number of appeals received from ratepayers in each of those rating authority areas is indicated in the following table.

The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. The approach of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and that any change in rates does not impact negatively on businesses and employment.

The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).<\/p><p>Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions.

Steady progress is being made on the National Revaluation Programme. Between 2007 and 2010 the three Rating Authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were revalued comprising c.17,700 commercial properties which represents approximately 22% of the national rateable valuation base. Additionally, there are currently six revaluation projects in progress which include the Rating Authority areas of Dublin City, Waterford City and County and Dungarvan Town together with Limerick City and County comprising c. 38,000 commercial properties or 32.6% of the valuation base. Furthermore, the statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made is under way with a further five rating authorities, Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny Borough Council, Carlow County Council and Carlow Town Council.

The OPW's role at Kilmainham is to maintain the physical fabric of the site and present it to the public through a dedicated Guide Service, explaining its 217 year history and its role in some of the key events in the formation of the State.  The site opens to the public on a fulltime basis 362 days per year, attracting significant numbers of visitors and sustaining a strong income profile.  As well as its tourist and heritage attractiveness to visitors, it is also the preferred chosen venue for frequent formal events and functions of social, cultural, artistic, civic and diplomatic significance.  However, its capacity to deal with an ever-increasing demand is severely limited currently by a number of key factors, most notably the physical limitations of the building, which was obviously constructed with a different purpose in mind and which is not ideally configured to sustain an exponentially increasing volume of visitors.  It is expected that this challenge will be further emphasised with an expected increase in visitor numbers in the period ahead, particularly in the context of the interest generated by the various commemoration events over the next few years.  At current levels, the existing Gaol building is at absolute capacity and cannot sustain further large scale increases in visitor traffic without significant risk to the fabric of the Monument and to the comfort and safety of visitors.  The OPW have been working on a suitable proposal to enhance the visitor experience at the Gaol.

This is the first time that a Directive on concessions has been developed as until now regulation at European level has been only partially developed. The Directives aim at simplifying the rules around procurement procedures, reducing the administrative burden on public authorities and potential contractors; thereby attracting a greater number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well as reducing the costs of procuring and contributing to a better use of resources. I welcome this agreement as it will strengthen the generation of jobs and growth, given that public authorities across the European Union spend approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum (some 19% of EU GDP) on the procurement of goods, services and works. The easier access to such contracts for SMEs is a fundamental criterion- there are over 20 million SMEs in Europe, accounting for more than 98% of all enterprises&ndash;their exclusion from such contracts made little economic sense. The simplified administrative framework will mean the inclusion of smaller businesses for contracts that have always been clearly within their capacity to perform.<\/p><p>  The agreement also includes incentives for authorities to divide their requirements in lots &ndash;something which will also further attract SMEs. The gains to be had by such revisions are not confined to industry alone-by increasing and broadening access to such contracts we are helping to create competition, to drive efficiencies and ensure the public monies are being used in a cost-effective manner to provide for public need but at the same time support job creation and innovation. The negotiations were detailed, lengthy and complex, requiring significant compromise on the part of all three institutions. These compromises will now be examined in depth, ahead of final approval at the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Sick Leave","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[36256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on a matter (details supplied) regarding sick leave policy for civil servants.","asker":"1017","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>I understand from the details supplied that the Deputy is enquiring about whether a policy will be introduced requiring civil servants to include any element of paid sick leave in claims for damages arising as a result of the actions of a third party.

The Deputy's scenario in respect of the PRD would be particularly challenging in terms of costing on account of its complexity. This complexity arises from recourse to an eight-band tiered deduction structure instead of the current four-band structure, significant departures from existing band boundaries, and both increases and decreases in the percentage rates. Furthermore, it is possible that the Exchequer would experience net losses, not net savings, under the proposal, given that substantial rate reductions are proposed on the first &euro;60,000 of salary.<\/p><p>  As already indicated, my Department is not in a position to supply a detailed costing in relation to the PSPR adjustments which the Deputy has proposed. However, by drawing on previously undertaken costings work, it is possible to ascribe an approximate order-of-magnitude savings figure of a further &euro;5 million to the PSPR proposals made by the Deputy. This approximate and tentative &euro;5 million PSPR savings estimate arises very substantially from the Deputy's proposal in Question No. 36459\/13 in respect of pensions awarded up to the end of February 2012. The estimate is not subject to significant variation in respect of the separate PSPR scenarios advanced in the Deputy&rsquo;s Questions No. 36460\/13 and 36461\/13 in respect of pensions awarded between 1 March 2012 and the end of August 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer Savings","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02250"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[36463\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the current number of public sector employees per '000 population; if he will provide the projected number of sector employees per '000 population by the end of 2015; the saving to Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, was capped at five times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[36464\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the saving to Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, were capped at 5.5 times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[36465\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the saving to the Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, were capped at 6.5 times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[36466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the saving to the Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, were capped at 7 times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[36781\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the savings to the Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, was capped at 5 times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[36782\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the saving to Exchequer if senior public sector pay, excluding the hospital consultants, were capped at six times the first scale point of a new entrant full time clerical officer rate.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":743,"content":"<p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 273 to 276, inclusive, and 280 and 281 together.<\/p><p>  I refer to my replies to Questions Nos. 402, 403 and 407 of 16 July 2013.

IDA Ireland will continue to market County Monaghan as part of its strategy for the North East Region for new inward investment through its Gateway of Dundalk, in line with the Government&rsquo;s National Spatial Strategy and will work closely with its client companies across the Region.  <\/p><p>  The Monaghan County Enterprise Board develops indigenous enterprise potential, stimulates economic activity at local level, promotes the establishment of micro-enterprises, provides financial support to viable projects, and provides business advice and training. Support is available, subject to certain criteria, to develop indigenous micro-enterprises and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services. Job retention and creation are inherent considerations in the Board&rsquo;s activities. <\/p><p>  In 2012, Monaghan CEB paid out &euro;258,522 to 14 projects and 648 people availed of their training programmes. In 2013 to date, Monaghan CEB has approved grant aid of &euro;171,220 to 6 start-up and developing companies with an expected job creation figure of 15.   <\/p><p>Persons from Monaghan who are currently running their own business or are considering starting their own business can contact the Monaghan CEB at: www.mceb.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology Issues","counter":761,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRU01350"},{"type":"question","counter":762,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[36107\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRU01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is preparing his Department to adapt to and make maximum use of next generation technologies in information and communications to better enhance the interaction of his Department with the citizen and the internal functioning of his Department; if he intends to conduct a risk analysis in respect of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":763,"content":"<p>The term next generation technologies does not have any widely accepted meaning, and may refer to any number of technological developments.

These Council Conclusions represent important steps in defining the future landscape of the European Space effort. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and of the European Space Agency, and the contribution which these partners make to economic growth and competitiveness.  Progress was also made on the proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) support programme which will ensure the security of satellite data for all sectors and users of such services. Initial discussions also took place on a proposed Regulation on Copernicus &ndash; the European Union&rsquo;s Flagship satellite-based earth monitoring programme.  <\/p><p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &ldquo;Establishing appropriate relations between the EU and the European Space Agency&rdquo;, adopted in November 2012, proposed several options for the evolution of this relationship. Council Conclusions on EU\/ESA relations adopted under the Irish Presidency on 18 February 2013 requested the Commission to work closely with ESA to carry out a comprehensive cost benefit analysis and impact assessment of a set of options, including those proposed in the Commission&rsquo;s Communication. At the Competitiveness Council meeting in May the Commission presented an information paper updating the Council on the status of its reflections on the evolution of EU-ESA relations. The Commission informed the Council that it had commenced an in-depth study of the options for the evolution of this relationship and informed the Council that the first results of this study are expected to be presented to Member States towards the end of this year. <\/p><p>Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &quot;EU Space Industrial Policy - Releasing the Potential for Economic Growth in the Space Sector&quot; adopted on 28 February 2013 Council Conclusions on this Communication were adopted at the Competitiveness Council on 30 May. These Conclusions represent a significant advancement in defining European Space policy. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and its contribution to economic growth and competitiveness. Ireland&rsquo;s space strategy is to build a sustainable, knowledge intensive and export focused space industry in Ireland, leading to increased levels of exports, sales and employment, to support strategic research in Irish third level institutions and to promote the use of space based systems for commercial and wider societal needs. While this is achieved mainly through Ireland&rsquo;s participation and investment in the European Space Agency (ESA), this will be further supported by the EU space industrial policy.<\/p><p>  Under the Irish Presidency the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking Support Programme adopted on 28 February 2013 was examined at meetings of the Space Working Party between March and May. Space surveillance and tracking is of critical interest to countries with space assets and while Ireland has no space assets at present we are critically dependent on the security of satellite data for all sectors, actors and users of satellite-based services. The proposed SST service will increase the safety of satellite operations by reducing collision risks and helping to better predict uncontrolled re-entries of inactive satellites or space debris and increase European non-dependence levels.   Member States expressed support for the proposal, however, a number also expressed concern in relation to certain security, financing and governance aspects of the proposal. The Presidency worked intensively to progress the proposal, however, full agreement on the text was not possible and on this basis the Irish Presidency presented a Progress Report on the status of negotiations to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May.<\/p><p>  The Commission adopted the Copernicus Regulation on 29 May 2013 and the proposal was presented to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May and was also presented to the Space Working Party on 7 June for an initial exchange of views. Copernicus is the new name for the European Earth Observation Programme GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security). Copernicus is a European initiative for the implementation of information services dealing with environment and security. Copernicus is based on observation data received from Earth Observation satellites and ground based information. The overall objective of the Copernicus initiative is to support Europe&rsquo;s goals regarding sustainable development and global governance of the environment by providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge. Through Copernicus the state of our environment and its short, medium and long-term evolution will be monitored to support policy decisions or investments.  Copernicus will provide services in six sectors: Marine monitoring, Atmosphere monitoring, Climate change monitoring, Land monitoring, Emergency management and Security. A number of Government Departments, agencies and organisations have an interest in aspects of the proposal as potential users of the system and Copernicus will also provide opportunities for commercial applications in the downstream sector based on full and open access to Copernicus observation data and information products. This ambitious Earth observation programme is headed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Environment Agency and the European Space Agency and will enter its full operational phase in 2014.<\/p><p>  The achievements of the Irish Presidency in the development of European Space Policy will contribute to the development of a strong and competitive European space industry and will provide further support to Irish industrial space interests and provide opportunities for growth particularly in the SME sector which encompasses the majority of Irish space companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Companies Law Issues","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[36168\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the company law (accounting) directive between EU member states will reduce an administrative burden for small and medium enterprises in the long run, but in the short and medium term, if he sees this changeover to be burdensome to Irish small and medium-sized enterprises; his views on whether now is the correct time to be making these changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

If an employee has earned income from self-employment, PRSI as a self-employed contributor is also payable on the profits from that self-employed activity as well as from any other unearned income the individual may have.  Similarly a self-employed contributor (who is not an employee) pays PRSI on both earned and unearned income.  However if an employee has unearned income only, there is no PRSI charge on the unearned income.  Unearned income includes rental and investment income as well as income from dividends, deposits and savings and from overseas investments. <\/p><p>  In Budget 2013 the Minister for Finance indicated that the income base on which PRSI is charged will be broadened, consequently I introduced the following measures:<\/p><p>  - With effect from 1 January 2013 modified rate contributors with additional earned self-employed income (from a profession or trade) and any other unearned income (such as rental income) became liable to PRSI at the rate of 4% on all such income:<\/p><p>  - In 2014, the exemption from PRSI applying to all employees who have no additional self-employed earned income but who do have unearned income only (such as rental income), will be abolished, such income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. <\/p><p>  Social Insurance applies to persons over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, which is currently age 66 years.

","asker":"1100","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":835,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the challenges facing the trustees and the sponsoring employers of defined benefit pension schemes.  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise.  It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem, facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &quot;health&quot; of a scheme can be tested.  When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised.  The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &quot;promised&quot; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>   In addition to the range of both legislative and administrative measures introduced over the last few years to assist the trustees and sponsoring employers to restore pension provision to a sustainable position, I introduced measures last year to protect scheme members against future volatility in the financial markets.  Defined benefits schemes will be required to maintain a risk reserve with effect from January 2016 and to meet this risk reserve requirement by the end of 2023.   <\/p><p>  It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve will present an added challenge for pension schemes, however, guidance issued by the Regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement. <\/p><p>  The size of the funding standard risk reserve depends on the nature of the assets held by the scheme in question.  The greater the amount of lower risk assets held, the lower the reserve requirement.  The level of the risk reserve was initially set at 15% of holdings other than bonds or cash.  The occupational pension schemes (funding standard reserve) regulations 2013 reduced the risk reserve requirement from 15% to 10% and extended the range of assets which have the effect of reducing the Funding Standard reserve requirement.  These additional measures were put in place to provide further assistance to scheme in restoring the scheme funding position.<\/p><p>  This measure was put in to protect scheme members from exposure to financial volatility and to assist in securing the future sustainability of schemes.  You will be aware that investment losses in Ireland were the largest because of the large share of equities in pension fund portfolios, around two-thirds of assets before the crisis hit, compared with an average of 36% in the 20 OECD countries where data are available.<\/p><p>  There has been a decline in the number of defined benefit schemes over the last decade.  This decline is replicated in many other OECD countries and is referred to in the recent OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System.  The persistent funding difficulties experienced by defined benefit schemes have been well recognised and employers, unions and trustees have been making strenuous efforts to protect the viability of their schemes. While trustees and employers will explore a range of options to secure the sustainability of pension provision, some schemes will wind up.  The level of scheme funding at the date of the wind-up will determine the extent to which the scheme can meet all of its liabilities.  It is recognised that in situations where a scheme is severely under-funded, the expected level of benefit which an active and deferred members of a scheme will receive will be reduced.  Section 48 of the Pensions Act determines the order in which the assets of a scheme are distributed on the wind up of a scheme.  This is an issue which has been examined in some depth and is under consideration at present, along with other defined benefit issues.  I am keeping the situation under review and will report back to Government in the coming months on these issues.  Legislative proposals and additional reforms will be considered at that stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":836,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[35947\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a domiciliary care allowance will be approved for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Department has embarked on a major programme of business and system change to support these objectives and is focussing its development efforts in this regard.

Professional expertise is maintained by staff training, review of technology literature, networking and monitoring industry trends.  When a technology or technique appears to have sufficient contribution to warrant further investigation, the Department explores it in more depth.  This usually takes the form of an exploratory project to evaluate the technology concerned and\/or the processes necessary to take advantage of it while minimising the investment required.  One of the objectives of an exploratory project is to identify and mitigate any risks involved, should it be decided to proceed to more widespread deployment.<\/p><p>  Once the Department is satisfied that there is sufficient return on the investment required to deploy new technologies, it will generally commence deployment on a pilot basis to ensure that benefits are realisable and, if successful, will follow this with more widespread deployment.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that my Department adapts to, and makes maximum use of, modern information and communications technologies and that any new technologies are explored with due care to maximise investments and to position the Department to deliver on its major transformation programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW02550"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[36128\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRW02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will confirm that no staff from her Department will be moving to local authorities either on a temporary or permanent basis to enable the coming on stream of the new housing assistance payment regime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is expected that the delays in vetting will reduce over the next number of months as the new staff are deployed. <\/p><p>  In the interim, to ensure that the services supported by CE are not disrupted as a result of the current delays in the vetting process, Department of Social Protection staff have been told to exercise flexibility and sanction extensions of employment where sponsors can demonstrate that such extensions are necessary.  <\/p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance to sponsor organisations on rescheduling their recruitment process to better anticipate delays in garda vetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Pension Provisions","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRX01950"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[36378\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in respect of each State agency and commercial State company under the aegis of her Department, if she will provide details of the name of each pension scheme; details of the salary percentage contributions made by the employer and the employees; the latest information on the funding position of the scheme; if any changes are planned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the full insolvency process. <\/p><p>  The pilot scheme envisages a third party service provider, acting as an intermediary between the borrowers and the lenders, who would look at the borrowers overall debts, issues of affordability of all debts and make agreements with the banks and credit unions on new levels of repayments ( including write downs) etc.<\/p><p>  When the framework was announced the third party service provider hadn&rsquo;t been identified.  Facilitated by the Central Bank, a pilot working group comprising banks, credit unions and lenders bodies has been established to oversee the pilot, a sub group of which examined the proposals, from a number of applicants, submitted to manage the pilot. CIB \/ MABS made a detailed submission outlining how they would manage the pilot if they were successful in becoming the third party service provider. <\/p><p>  The CIB\/MABS proposal was successful and they confirmed to the Central Bank their acceptance of the offer. However at follow up discussions with the lenders to discuss the proposal, CIB \/ MABS, after much consideration, decided that the proposed approach of the lenders was not the best fit for MABS at this particular point in time and notified the Central Bank of the withdrawal of their proposal. MABS felt that the pilot provides for a very specific role for the service provider, which is significantly narrower than MABS current role and provides only a limited facility for MABS to advocate on behalf of clients. <\/p><p>  MABS has communicated its continued commitment to the approach and principles of the pilot and its support of the comprehensive approach to multiple-debt resolution proposed.  Furthermore, MABS is willing to incorporate aspects of the pilot in its own work with borrowers and lenders and has offered to contribute to the work of the Steering Committee for the pilot. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will continue to play an important role and provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":893,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":894,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[36442\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the number of amendments to legislation he proposed during committee and report stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2012; if she will provide in tabular form the number of her own amendments accepted; and if she will indicate in tabular form the number of amendments accepted from members of the Seanad, broken down by Senator.","asker":"1075","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":895,"content":"<p>Three Bills were initiated and finalised by the Minister for Social Protection during 2012 - the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, the Social Welfare Bill 2012 and the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012.<\/p><p>  No committee or report stage amendments were proposed by the Minister for Social Protection to any of these Bills in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. Final agreement has not yet been reached. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with them.<\/p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season provided that final agreement is reached with them.<\/p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 50 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department. Bord na M&oacute;na is proceeding to negotiate with landowners in relation to the purchase or long term lease of sites.<\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Relocation Options","counter":1053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[36404\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC01700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the outcome of efforts to find a relocation option for the turf cutters on Coolrain Bog, County Laois; and if there has been any progress made on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1055,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment and a stratigraphy assessment of a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Coolrain Bog raised bog special area of conservation, on behalf of my Department.

The site is protected by a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts due to its historical importance as the location of the final Council of War and last headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. <\/p><p>  Because of the Preservation Order any works at, or in proximity to, the national monument require my consent under the National Monuments Acts.  As part of the consent process I have undertaken an Environmental Impact Assessment and considered all the various submissions and observations I have received in relation to the proposed works. <\/p><p>  My decision on the consent application approved the applicant's proposals for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre on the site, involving the full repair and conservation of the four buildings.  However, it did not approve the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site which date from or before 1916. Neither did I consent to the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site or to the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16.<\/p><p>  The consent I have given is conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals. <\/p><p>  The Moore Street national monument is of huge significance and importance. It is highly appropriate that it would be preserved and that an appropriate commemorative centre would be put in place to mark the momentous events which took place there.  Having carefully considered all the relevant factors, I believe that the decision I have made on the consent application is the best way to ensure that work can take place to restore and conserve the national monument, to develop an appropriate commemorative centre there and also to ensure that the monument site is fully protected for future generations.<\/p><p>I would hope that the consent applicant can now revise the plans for the Moore Street national monument, in consultation with the planning authority, Dublin City Council, and in line with the conditions that have been set, so that an appropriate commemorative centre can be in place for 2016<i>.<\/i>    I will assist and support that process to the fullest extent possible insofar as my role under the National Monuments Acts is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1061,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[36407\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to extend the opening hours of the key historical and cultural institutions for the duration of the peak tourist period in Summer and early Autumn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1062,"content":"<p>My Department and the bodies funded from its Vote Group are committed to maximising the tourism potential and to increasing visitor numbers to Ireland's historical and cultural institutions. <\/p><p>  In this regard, my Department has been liaising with the various cultural institutions to ensure that high quality exhibition programmes are in place in these institutions during the peak tourist period.

It membership includes Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Alan Wall Director, Department of Education and Skills and Niall O Donnch&uacute;, Assistant Secretary, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  <\/p><p>  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has been proactive in meeting organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives including developing a website \/ portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for Art Rich Schools and for artists become involved in the programme are also being examined by the Arts Council and this Group. <\/p><p>  There is no specific funding provision in my Department's Vote for arts in education this year.  However, the Deputies may be aware that in May 2012 I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  <\/p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 will be available to arts organisations under this scheme and the majority of the Philanthropy Initiative funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  The application form includes a provision that in the event of multiple applications competing for limited grant allocation, priority will be given to Arts in Education projects aimed at disadvantaged (DEIS) schools.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Library","counter":1087,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1088,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[36415\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding the work of the Office of the Chief Herald; the costs the office and it&rsquo;s work incurred on the State; the revenue it generated for the State; the projected running costs and revenue generated by the office over the coming budgetary year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1089,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the statutory Board of the National Library of Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Smartphone Applications","counter":1090,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1091,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[36416\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the progress that has been made on a website portal and joint commercial and marketing strategy as outlined in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014; if he will outline that progress; the projected income that such an initiative might accrue to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1092,"content":"<p>Culturefox, funded by my Department, is available on the worldwide web at   .

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Protection may be extended to previously unrecorded monuments by entering them in the Register of Historic Monuments or the Record of Monuments and Places.     Many monuments are located in the more remote parts of the country and the assistance of local communities is crucial in aiding my Department in their protection.  The vigilance of local people has proved to be of crucial assistance in identifying unlawful interference with archaeological monuments and objects and in their successful investigation and recovery.

The first is a legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who are signing up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years. The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to. This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting.<\/p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.<\/p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.<\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, it is the absolute aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one. That is what my officials are working to achieve, and progress is being made in that task. However, I feel it is important to be upfront with turf cutters and be clear that relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters. The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters within the shortest timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":1144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREE02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1145,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[36487\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREE02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will give a commitment that his Department will sponsor a nationwide primary and second level school project as part of the centenary celebration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &#8220;cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.&#8221;<\/p><p>  The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List   for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:<\/p><p>  - The Burren;<\/p><p>  - C&eacute;ide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands;<\/p><p>  - The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; <\/p><p>  - The Historic City of Dublin;<\/p><p>  - Early Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice);<\/p><p>  - The Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex and potentially Navan Fort in Armagh);<\/p><p>  - Western Stone Forts (Aran Islands - 7 forts, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and Dingle Peninsula.<\/p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:<\/p><p>  - the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS); <\/p><p>  - the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and <\/p><p>  - the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).<\/p><p>  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site's inclusion on the World Heritage List.  <\/p><p>  I believe that there are significant economic and cultural benefits to be gained from having additional Irish sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage list. I also share UNESCO's view that the nomination process must be driven at a local level and enjoy strong support amongst the communities within the potential world heritage areas.  In order to further progress the nomination process for the sites on the current Tentative List, I have arranged a seminar in the Autumn for local authorities and relevant local\/community groups from areas with sites on the Tentative List.<\/p><p>  The objective of the seminar will be to guide and equip participants, in particular the local authorities, to produce the detailed material needed by my Department to support the preparation and submission of substantive applications to UNESCO for World Heritage inscription.  The seminar will assemble relevant experts, local authorities and other groups and provide a forum where all elements of applying for and retaining World Heritage status will be explored and explained.<\/p><p>  I expect that, following the Autumn seminar, there will be a substantive basis for advancing one or more sites from the current Tentative List with a view to inscription on the World Heritage list.  Against that background, my immediate priority will be to achieve progress with UNESCO inscriptions from the current Tentative List and it would be premature at this point to speculate as the when the next review of the Tentative List might take place.  However, as I have indicated, drawing up a proposal for inclusion on the Tentative List requires a great deal of research and agreement amongst all stakeholders and it would be very worthwhile for the relevant interests in the areas you have cited to make a start on that process at  local level in anticipation of the next review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1153,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[36491\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of archaeologists employed by his Department on a remunerated basis and under the JobBridge scheme, if applicable; and his plans to employ additional archaeologists this year or in 2014.

I would point out to the Deputy, however, that in the case of three sets of board appointments where such restrictions did not apply and where all members were appointed by me, as the Minister, I took steps to ensure that the gender target of 40% was, in fact, exceeded &ndash; National Concert Hall Board (60%), Heritage Council Board (50%) and Irish Film Board (42%).<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department was established in June 2011 and, accordingly, it is not feasible to provide comparative data of the nature referred to in the Question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":1165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1166,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[36165\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the agreements achieved under the Irish EU Presidency regarding the European Network and Information Security Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1167,"content":"<p>The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was established in 2004 to help combat the growing threat to EU security, infrastructure and the economy from cyber incidents.<\/p><p>  At the end of January 2013, following protracted discussions in Council, the Irish Presidency reached agreement with the European Parliament on the proposal which, among other things, provides for a new seven year mandate for ENISA and a more efficient management structure for the agency.

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Louth, can be found on ComReg's website at .  Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.  The National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme are examples of two such interventions.<\/p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland through a combination of private investment and State interventions, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all of our citizens and businesses in advance of the EU's target date of 2020.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services.  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  This will culminate in the development of coverage maps which will aggregate the information provided by operators.

Following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the Commission carried out an analysis of the legislative and regulatory situation in the European Union, and suggested a course of action, including revision of existing legislation, as well as future new proposals, strengthening EU intervention capacity, and action at regional and global levels.   Following detailed negotiations among Member States, facilitated by both the Cyprus and Irish Presidencies of the European Union, agreement was reached in March of this year during the Irish Presidency, on a proposal on safety of offshore oil and gas prospection, exploration and production activities.<\/p><p>  The Offshore Safety Directive provides for a new area of competence for the EU in the respect of the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities addressing their potential to give rise to both safety and major environmental hazards.  The Directive introduces a number of very important and complex provisions for improving safety for offshore gas and oil drilling which include, in the first instance, reaching agreement on a text relating to the establishment of the Competent Authority in each Member State.  The position agreed recognises both the difference in activity levels among Member States and the potential additional burden on them, which the new Directive could give rise to. While the agreement achieved acknowledges the need to have regard to such factors, it does so without diluting the need for safety at all times.<\/p><p>  The issue of liability regimes is also addressed, and it was the view of the Council that it could not come to a pre-judgment on such a crucial issue pending the outcome of EU Commission studies, which are due to report next year.  Another matter of considerable significance is the inclusion of provisions with regard to public participation, ensuring that either Strategic Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Assessment would be undertaken with respect to all relevant offshore activities prior to their approval and commencement.  Other noteworthy issues that are included are confidential reporting, response effectiveness, activities in the Arctic, the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency, activities outside the EU and criminalising conduct leading to a major accident.<\/p><p>  The agreement reached will ensure a consistent use of best practices for major hazards control by oil and gas industry offshore operations potentially affecting Union waters or shores, implement best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities, strengthen the Union&rsquo;s preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting EU citizens or the environment, and improve and clarify existing liability and compensation provisions. <\/p><p>  Ultimately the goal of the safety regulation of offshore exploration activity is to improve safety in extremely challenging environments.  There will be significant safety measures arising from this Directive that will benefit our global environment.<\/p><p>It is a requirement of the Directive that it be transposed into, national legislation within 2 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRFF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[36200\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 447 of 28 May 2013, if he will provide details of the public tender process referred to in the reply, with details of the manner of advertising of this process; the time limits that applied; the number of enquires received; the number of tenders received; and if he will provide details of the principals involved in the successful tender and the legal status and address of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1186,"content":"<p>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 290 on 18 June 2013, matters in relation to the sale of premises are a day to day operational matter for the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) subject to Public Financial Procedures.<\/p><p>  Details as regards public tendering and the transaction referred to by the Deputy are included on files held by the Board and not the Department.<\/p><p>In this regard, I have asked IFI to expedite contact with the Deputy to address her queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy Review","counter":1187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1188,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[36229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will detail Ireland's contributions to the European Council discussion on the Commission's communication, entitled \"Making the internal energy market Work\"; if Ireland's concerns were incorporated into the communique; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department and the Department of Social Protection have been working closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in this project.<\/p><p>  Work has also been on-going with the County and City Managers Association (CCMA), through the Project Steering Group, in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP. In June a Project Implementation Team was initiated, which will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases. A detailed business process design for HAP is currently underway which involves input from all the relevant key stakeholders. Following the completion of the business process design the implementation team will, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for the test phase in a number of local authorities.<\/p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the CCMA, through its involvement in both the Project Steering Group and the Project Implementation Team, is providing on-going advice in relation to the resources that will be required by local authorities to implement HAP. This input will continue as the detail of the scheme is developed further this year.<\/p><p>  One of the specific objectives of HAP is to facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector which it is intended would lead to improved standards of accommodation, improved levels of registration with the PRTB and strengthened processes for ensuring tax compliance by landlords. Landlords will be expected to comply with the terms of the Scheme in these regards. While I do not anticipate an issue with tenants being able to secure appropriate accommodation in the private rented sector under HAP, I will be keeping this matter under review in the pilot phase of HAP implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maritime Vessel Recycling","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[36178\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the agreement on ship recycling regulation during the Irish EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1218,"content":"<p>The agreement reached between the Presidency and European Parliament on the Ship Recycling Regulation concluded six months of intensive negotiations under the Irish EU Presidency. Over 1,000 ships a year are recycled worldwide. Contrary to most other waste streams, ships generally have a significant financial value at end-of-life. Steel is the main material extracted in the recycling process but older ships, in particular, also contain many hazardous substances including asbestos and heavy metals. Much of the recycling is carried out in facilities that lack sufficient safety measures or environmental protection for workers, which leads to high accident rates and extensive pollution.<\/p><p>  It is intended that the new Regulation will provide a much-needed stimulus to raise standards for recycling all ships, in the interim period before the entry into force of the 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The Regulation covers the whole life-cycle of EU-flagged ships and transposes for the EU the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention. The Regulation is the first legislative instrument adopted at regional level in respect of this significant waste stream containing hazardous substances.<\/p><p>The new EU ship recycling regime comprises the following main elements:<\/p><p> - EU ship owners will be required to only recycle ships at facilities on the EU approved list, either in the EU or in third countries;<\/p><p> - in order to be on the EU approved list, ship recycling facilities must comply with the minimum requirements of the regulation as to worker health and safety procedures and environmental protection;<\/p><p>- ship recycling facilities must be approved by national authorities in the case of EU facilities and by independent verifiers with appropriate qualifications in the case of non-EU facilities. Such non-EU facilities must remain open to inspection by EU inspectors in order to verify their ongoing compliance with the requirements of the regulation;<\/p><p>- ships will be required to maintain an inventory of hazardous materials on board at all times;<\/p><p>- ships entering EU ports are to   be open to inspections by port state control authorities to verify the maintenance of the inventory;<\/p><p>- EU ships will be subject to surveys at 5-yearly intervals after being put in service;<\/p><p>- owners of EU ships will be required to engage an approved ship recycling facility to prepare a &ldquo;ship recycling plan&rdquo; prior to \trecycling, such plan to include how hazardous materials in the ship structure are to be managed and which shall be submitted to the flag state administration;<\/p><p>- flag state administrations will issue a &ldquo;ready for recycling&rdquo; certificate before authorising the recycling of EU ships, having - (i) verified that the hazardous materials inventory has been properly maintained, (ii) approved the ship recycling plan, and (iii) verified that the ship recycling facility where the ship is to be recycled is included in the EU approved list; and<\/p><p>- the ship re cycling facility must confirm the completion of the recycling of the ship to the EU flag state administration.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the new regulation will be effective and make a positive contribution to the proper recycling of EU ships which can be followed globally. I also hope that this new EU regulation will act as an important stimulus to facilitate the early ratification of the Hong Kong Convention on Ship Recycling which was adopted in 2009 and that, on foot of this EU initiative, other global regions will follow the EU lead in respect of this important waste stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Yield","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[36642\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRGG03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the revenue that would be raised from retaining the non-principal private residence tax and increasing it to &euro;300; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, contain national eligibility criteria which must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household's eligibility for social housing support. The Regulations provide for certain information to be gathered in respect of households which are determined to have a need, including the number, gender and ages of persons in the household.\u00a0In this regard I am confident that when I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas on 7 May 2013, the results to be published later this year will give an accurate reflection of the level and type of need at both local authority and national level.   <\/p><p>  In terms of addressing that need, Government policy is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support requirements through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014. Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure the identification of suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going. <\/p><p>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year or in subsequent years. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRJJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Administration","counter":1303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1304,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[36595\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of Leader projects of more than &euro;150,000 that are awaiting ministerial approval; the date each project was submitted; the total value of the projects involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1305,"content":"<p>My Department currently has 42 projects at various stages in the assessment process   .

Two main issues have impacted on the revised allocations recently notified to Local Development Companies (LDCs). <\/p><p>  The first relates to overall Programme performance. During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of LDCs, who were contracted to deliver the Programme, were not committing funds at the level required to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline. Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available. <\/p><p>  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &lsquo;first-come first served&rsquo; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed. All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them. All LDCs had an equal opportunity to maximise funding in their respective areas, and some companies availed of this more than others. <\/p><p>  The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates. During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013. This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. <\/p><p>  In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs, taking into account the level of commitments already entered into. <\/p><p>  Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million the total spend to date and outstanding contractual commitments under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370 million. &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs. Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment. The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding. Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation, an adjustment was made to bring the revised allocation up to 80% of the original. <\/p><p>  In the case of Cavan Monaghan LEADER the revised allocation represents a decrease of 17.5% from their original allocation. The redistribution of available funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible with many LDCs experiencing similar reductions. <\/p><p>  I am committed to the continued monitoring of this situation and my Department will conduct another formal review of commitments and expenditure levels at the end of August 2013. If LDCs are not performing with regard to the Programme commitment levels, allocations will again be revised in the context of maximizing commitments to the end of the Programme by December 2013.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Projects","counter":1330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1331,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[36772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if a report on the investigation by the Ombudsman carried out in respect of a community project (details supplied) in County Meath has been communicated to his Department; if the Ombudsman has recommended to the Department the funding that should be paid in respect of the community project in question; if he will advise if his Department has taken any action on foot of the investigation by the Ombudsman; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1332,"content":"<p>In line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach to rural development under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, there are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the Programme throughout the country.

A cadastral map is a map that shows the boundaries and ownership of the individual land parcels.<\/p><p>  We do not operate a cadastre in Ireland at present and no individual State organisation holds all of the relevant data. However, the data which could potentially form elements of a cadastre is established through the functions of different State Agencies, including the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland. <\/p><p>  Our system of Land Registration, which was established in 1892 and is now under the control of the Property Registration Authority is based on an &quot;open&quot; register underpinned by a State guarantee and was designed to gradually replace a registration of deeds system which had been in place since 1707. Since its introduction, the programme of land registration in Ireland has been both extensive and very successful and almost 2.8 million land parcels, representing approximately 95% of all property in the country, are now registered in the Land Registry of the Property Registration Authority.<\/p><p>  When title or ownership is registered in the Land Registry, the legal ownership is entered on folios which form the registers maintained in the Land Registry. In conjunction with folios, the Land Registry also maintains Land Registry maps. Where title is registered in the Land Registry it is referred to as &quot;registered property&quot; and is open to public inspection. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011. As part of the implementation of the Reform Plan, the Government announced on 31 October 2012 that it would proceed with the merger of the Property Registration Authority with the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland. Work is underway to advance the implementation of the merger under the supervision of a Project Board comprised of senior officials from the three Government Departments concerned and the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies. Among the issues to be examined in the context of the merger are the strategic goals and priorities of the prospective merged organisation. It is anticipated that it will be possible to derive significant added value from the bringing together of the rich data holdings of the three organisations concerned. It is possible that the development of a cadastre system for Ireland may be considered in that context. I should note that full implementation of the merger will require significant legislative change in due course, and that any move to a cadastre system could potentially have very significant implications in relation to land and property law in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":1340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1341,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[36063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures he is taking to preserve privacy online and protection of citizens' data in the wake of\u00a0significant breaches of internet privacy being committed by the American National Security Agency and the British GCsa; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1342,"content":"<p> As I have indicated to the House previously, I, of course, fully understand the concerns which have arisen in the wake of recent media reports about the PRISM programme.

I raised the concerns which had been expressed about the PRISM programme with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at my recent meetings with him in Dublin.  At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime.<\/p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  I will continue to make the point at international level that in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I have emphasised the importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and appropriate.<\/p><p>  It was agreed that data protection and security experts from the US and from the EU would meet to clarify remaining matters as necessary.

The objectives of this instrument include contributing to crime prevention, the combating of cross-border, serious and organised crime including terrorism, reinforcing coordination and cooperation between law enforcement authorities of Member States, enhancing the capacity of Member States and the Union for managing effectively security-related risks and crisis, and preparing for and protecting people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other security related incidents.

I am advised that in 2013, some &euro;19 million has been allocated to fund MABS and that sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to two years, to establish an Approved Intermediary service. In addition to this dedicated services there will  also be additional Approved Intermediaries, when authorised, located in MABS offices throughout the country. These Approved Intermediaries will not charge any fee for arranging a Debt Relief Notice. In accordance with the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, Approved Intermediaries can only process Debt Relief Notices and do not have any role in relation to Debt Settlement Arrangements or Personal Insolvency Arrangements.<\/p><p>  With regard to Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) there are two separate sets of fees. The ISI fee for applying for a Protective Certificate for a DSA or a PIA and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) fee.  The fee payable to the ISI in relation to the issue of a Protective Certificate for a DSA will be &euro;250 and &euro;500 for a PIA. Insofar as Practitioner fees associated with the development of DSAs and PIAs are concerned, these fees will be negotiated with an individual debtor by the PIP in advance of a case proceeding and will be deducted from the amount of money an individual debtor is calculated as having available to pay their creditors during the term of the arrangement. These arrangements could last for up to 7 years. As such this fee should have a relatively minor impact on the debtor themselves. In fact some prospective Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) have indicated that, if and when authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to practice, they will not charge upfront fees for initial consultations with insolvent debtors. Furthermore, the Regulations relating to PIPs require them to clearly specify their level of charges and associated costs before being appointed by the debtor to develop an arrangement for a PIA or DSA.   Based on experience in other jurisdictions, I am advised by the ISI that there have been indications that the issue of fees rarely arises. It is anticipated that debtors will be able to afford the application fees. It should also be noted that the reasonable living expenses guidelines published under Section 23 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 make allowances for savings and contingencies in addition to social inclusion money. It will therefore be possible for debtors to build up  the money required for the ISI fee over a relatively short period of time.  In cases where an insolvency arrangement is not possible, it will be open to the individual debtor to petition for bankruptcy, the term of which is being reduced from 12 years to 3 years under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[36285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of drivers detected for speeding on the N3 in County Dublin and County Meath in the years 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013; the number of drivers who have paid such fines to date; the number of drivers who have yet to pay a fine; and the number of who were subject to legal action for non-payment of a fine for speeding in these areas.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

The Deputy might wish to note that it is a generally accepted principle internationally, and one which Ireland applies, that a person should seek asylum in the first safe host country in which they arrive.

The granting of refugee status in Ireland is considered in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol thereto, and as defined in Section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).    Accordingly, Ireland remains steadfast in it commitments to its international obligations in this regard.

It would not be a matter for me as Minister to comment on any case a person might make to the courts in relation to an extradition application.  It may be helpful to add, however, in the context of a person seeking asylum here, that the Refugee Act, 1996 makes it clear that nothing in it shall be construed as preventing the extradition of a person in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Remuneration","counter":1363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1364,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[35950\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRLL01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason there has been a delay with the processing of a person's work entitlements (details supplied); the reason the necessary documentation was not sent in order to calculate and finalise payment of this persons entitlements; if he will reassure this person that their application will be processed without any further delay.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1365,"content":"<p>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Pension Scheme my Department is responsible for authorising and paying pensions to retired Garda&iacute;.

As is well known, in December of that year the Government took the difficult decision not to proceed with that commitment.  It will be recalled that the background to this decision was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 14 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.    All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.   The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are now 1 Superintendent, 3 Sergeants and approximately 127 whole time equivalent civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit. With further assignments of staff this month, staffing at the Unit will be of the order of 140 (whole time equivalent) staff, which represents an increase in staff assigned to the Unit of almost 50% since March this year. As staff become fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRMM00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1385,"content":"<p>Question No. 505 answered with Question No. 502.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law Review","counter":1386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRMM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1387,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[36000\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRMM00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"following the publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence of a report on its review of the legislation on prostitution here, if he will be bringing forward legislation on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[36248\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the recent report by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice which recommends the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual service; if he plans to take any action in relation to the report's recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 506 and 535 together.<\/p><p>  The report referred to by the Deputies was published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on 27 June and I have not yet had the opportunity to fully consider its contents.

It is expected that formal adoption of the Regulation will take place in time for the system to come into effect by the end of the year.  The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders. In particular, EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for member states' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information and to cooperate with each other and with the FRONTEX Agency in order to reduce the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and to increase internal security by preventing cross-border crime, such as trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs. It will also contribute to the protecting and saving the lives of migrants; particularly those at risk on the high seas where tragically lives have been lost of persons in small or makeshift craft seeking to reach European shores.<\/p><p>  The regulation will apply to the surveillance of land and sea external borders of the member states in the Schengen Area. It may also be applied to the surveillance of air borders as well as to checks at border crossing points if the member states voluntarily provide such information to EUROSUR. It is envisaged that the application of the EUROSUR regulation to the member states located at the southern and eastern external borders will start from December 2013 and to the remaining participating member states from December 2014.<\/p><p>  The Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part in the border provisions, in accordance with Council Decision 2002\/192\/EC of 28 February 2002. Ireland is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. The United Kingdom are in a similar position. However, the Regulation provides for the possibility of close cooperation and exchanges of information with Ireland and the United Kingdom on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom and one or several neighbouring Member States or through regional networks based on these agreements<b><\/b>which may assist in better achieving the objectives of EUROSUR.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, separately, with the objective of protecting the integrity of the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangement, Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on a range of measures aimed at securing the external borders of the CTA. The nature of this cooperation is much the same as that envisaged under the EUROSUR arrangement and involves daily operational cooperation between the immigration authorities of both countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRNN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schengen Agreement","counter":1425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRNN00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[36224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRNN00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if Ireland will have access to the exchange of information between police and border authorities now that the Schengen information system has been achieved during the Irish EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The second generation of this system was brought into operation in April 2013.<\/p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen Agreement, including police cooperation.  Our application to participate in the specified articles of the Agreement was approved by a Council Decision and, in accordance with this Decision, the provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This is because the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the UK did not.

At that time I explained that the independent Selection Panel, which was established to carry out this task, had confirmed to me that it had not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at that time.  The Selection Panel  suggested that the full-time nature of the position and the length of the contract (5 years) may have been issues that mitigated against the successful recruitment of a Chief Commissioner.  The position was designated as a full-time one as the Paris Principles, which govern the establishment of such bodies, contain a preference for a full-time Commissioners.  When the Chief Commissioner position was advertised it included a requirement that the person to be appointed should not have served on either the Equality Authority or the Human Rights Commission.  This requirement is considered essential to ensure that the Chief Commissioner will bring balance and neutrality to the position in a sensitive merger context and will remain as a requirement when the position is re-advertised.<\/p><p>  In the light of the experience gained in the recruitment process to date, I consider as already announced that future selection of persons to serve as members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission should be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The PAS has existed in its different forms since the foundation of the State, to ensure integrity and impartiality in the appointment of civil servants and other public servants and is independent in the discharge of its functions and would thus fully meet the Paris Principles&rsquo; requirement for a selection process independent of Government.<\/p><p>  This is a change in the selection process as originally adopted in the General Scheme of the Bill, which I consider is now required in the light of experience.  I note that use of the PAS was one of the other options considered by the Working Group set up to advise me on practical arrangements for establishment of IHREC in its report.  My Department is in consultation with the Public Appointment Service in relation to the detailed arrangements in that regard and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement shortly.

","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1467,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.<\/p><p>  I assume the question refers to a recently published article by the Ombudsman on asylum seekers.  The Ombudsman says in her article that her examination of a specific case, involving the HSE and the Department of Social Protection around the issue of a social welfare entitlement to a family which had been in Direct Provision, led her to comment on the asylum accommodation system more generally.  It should be noted that the Ombudsman Act, 1980 does not provide for the investigation by the Ombudsman of any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum. Notwithstanding that, I should add that INIS has administrative arrangements in place with the Office of the Ombudsman to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman is, of course, perfectly entitled to the personal opinions expressed in the article but I do not share many of them.  In particular, I do not accept the attempted correlation between the residents of direct provision accommodation centres and past residents of industrial schools or Magdalene laundries.  It is to be expected that asylum seekers, if given a choice in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, would prefer to have independent accommodation, a right to welfare and work and so on, instead of being restricted to the system of direct provision to meet their needs.  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, it should be noted that all EU Member States operate systems for dealing with asylum seekers which in one form or another greatly restrict their access to welfare, work or independent housing.  In reality, the system in this State is at least on a par and often significantly better than that in operation in many other Member States. In the circumstances, it is grossly misleading to characterise our treatment of asylum seekers as being akin to that meted out to subjects of abuse who had no protection of the law or relevant State bodies.<\/p><p>   I have recounted in responses to many D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions how the rights of residents of accommodation centres are protected both within the Direct Provision system and, of course, by the laws of our country. The Ombudsman's article, rightly, places great emphasis on the rights of children in the Direct Provision system. Again, I have explained before how children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through the Reception and Integration Agency's (RIA) Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated Child and Family Services unit in RIA.  Children in Direct Provision centres, of course, enjoy the same educational and health entitlements as Irish citizen children.  Sight must not be lost of the fact that applicants for refugee status, who otherwise would have no permission to be in the State, have their protection claims dealt with in accordance with a prescribed legal framework and exclusively on their merits having regard to their subjective and objective elements.  They have full recourse to the judicial review process in the courts and to the general protection of the State.<\/p><p>  I accept that the direct provision system is not ideal and many residents spend too long there. But it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the heads of those seeking protection or the right to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds or other reasons.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  It is acknowledged that the Direct Provision system provides value for money. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  In her article, the Ombudsman does not say that the direct provision system is in breach of international conventions. Rather, she references a number of reports critical of the direct provision system which argue that it is.  She acknowledges that, ultimately, such judgements are matters for a court.  Over the years, the direct provision system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies. Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR, and by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner.  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process In October, 2011. No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is no question but that the asylum system is slow, fragmented and is in need of reform and I am determined to see this reform through.  For me, the length of time spent in the Direct Provision system, rather than the quality of provision within the system itself, is the real issue and I am committed to remedying that. Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems&quot;, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way.<\/p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  In relation the accommodation centre in Millstreet, Co. Cork, issues inevitably arise in a system as complex and diverse as the Direct Provision system and it is important that they are dealt with quickly.  I am advised by RIA that there are ongoing discussions between residents and management. Senior officials in RIA have already visited the centre and will do so again today to provide any assistance required to achieve a resolution acceptable to all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1468,"content":"<p>Question No. 535 answered with Question No. 506.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1469,"content":"<p>Question No. 536 answered with Question No. 528.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":1470,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1471,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[36250\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department will be introducing further reforms in the domestic violence legal framework; the level of funding provided to Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence in 2013 and 2014.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1472,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims.

Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable.<\/p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders.  General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society.  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences. Arising from the review, l expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Support Services","counter":1476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1477,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[36252\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in the direct provision system; the total cost to the Exchequer of the current system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1478,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.

Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated \"whole-of-government\" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women and men. Cosc carries out its co-ordination functions primarily within the framework of the first National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The strategy was published in March 2010 and covers the period 2010 to 2014.<\/p><p>  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is achieved through a six monthly exercise to establish progress to date on the activities in the Strategy. Cosc undertakes the regular monitoring. The process is overseen by the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Men and a high-level group of officials known as the Strategy Oversight Committee. Each six monthly monitoring exercise is published on the Cosc website.  In addition, a mid-term review of the implementation of the strategy was completed in 2012 and published on the Cosc website following consideration by the National Steering Committees and the Oversight Committee.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex plan involving four objectives and 59 activities. The mid-term review of the National Strategy noted, in broad terms, that good progress had been made in relation to around a quarter of the planned activities, that a further fifty per cent of the activities were making progress with some delays and that approximately a fifth of the planned activities had limited or poor progress. The review resulted in a re-prioritisation of many of the actions of the strategy and an update of the time-frames for delivery of the actions.  An updated  table of the actions with the priority and time-frame associated has been published on the Cosc website.<\/p><p>  In terms of domestic abuse against children, I assume that the Deputy is referring to statistics recently published by Women's Aid in its annual report for 2012. There are a number of possible reasons for this increase. It is not, for instance, clear whether this represents a greater willingness of people who ring the Women's Aid helpline to discuss the emotional and other impacts of domestic abuse on their children, improved recording of this aspect of domestic abuse by the helpline, or an actual increase in the targeting of children in domestic situations. As one of the strategy's key aims  is to increase awareness among the general public of the incidence of domestic violence and among victims of the services available to them, increases in reporting are to be expected and indeed welcomed. There has been an increase in public debate and a range of policy initiatives in relation to children experiencing abuse, violence, neglect and bullying, which may lead to a greater willingness to discuss the impact of domestic violence on children.<\/p><p>  I would also like to state that front-line community and voluntary domestic violence services for those suffering from domestic violence are funded at present by the Health Service Executive for which the Minister for Health has responsibility.  I understand that responsibility for these services will transfer to the Child and Family Support Agency when established and that agency will come under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WROO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Committals","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRPP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[36255\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRPP00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason those convicted of minor offences are often brought to prison and returned from prison on the same day, often by the same Garda&iacute; who delivered them there in the first instance; his views on whether this makes a mockery of our justice system and that it is a waste of Garda&iacute; time and resources; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that on occasion those convicted of penalty points serve as little as two hours' prison sentence; the reason this is occurring; if it is down to a lack of prison places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p>  Given the number of prisoners in custody it is not possible to segregate those who are in prison for the first time from those who have been in custody on more than one occasion. It must be borne in mind that someone&rsquo;s first period of imprisonment does not necessarily indicate a first offence. Efforts are made, where possible to segregate remand prisoners from sentenced prisoners. In addition, prisoners who are vulnerable or have requested the protection of the Governor are segregated from the general prison population. Every effort is made to ensure that those prisoners who cannot associate freely with the general prison population have the greatest possible access to services.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRPP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community Issues","counter":1504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRPP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1505,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[36297\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRPP01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures he will take to ensure Travellers and Roma are directly involved in the development of Ireland's national Traveller Roma Integration Strategy.

Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State. <\/p><p>  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 16 July 2013, there were 1,280 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  I am further informed that, as a matter of Garda operational and data policy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not provide a break down of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 on a county by county or Divisional basis.   All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his\/her Division to assist him\/her in carrying out his\/her duties.  Where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken, including circulation through PULSE of their information, as well as inquiries to identify their current whereabouts.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.  <\/p><p>  I can further advise the Deputy that sex offenders released from prison, who are subject to supervision by the Probation Service under a Post Release Supervision Order, are assessed while in custody by the Probation Service using a validated risk assessment instrument. The risk and needs identified in the assessment inform the development of the case management plan, which is then monitored and supervised by the Probation Service in the community.  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified as a priority.<\/p><p>  I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish and British Governments on the sharing of information on sex offenders between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces, including the PSNI, is in place since 2006 and there are excellent working relationships surrounding the monitoring of the travel arrangements of the persons in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Magdalen Laundries Issues","counter":1543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1544,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[36457\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form by county and demographic, the numbers of applications received so far under the Magdalene Redress scheme; if he will provide an update on the status of the recommendations produced by Justice Quirke; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy,  I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.   <\/p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced. I am informed that no decision on an individual venue is taken without prior consultation with local stakeholders. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter. <\/p><p>  I am informed that a total of 16 venues have been closed since March 2011, in the following locations: Enniscorthy,  Athenry, Ballymote, Borrisokane, Boyle, Castlecomer, Castleisland, Castletownbere, Claremorris, Ennistymon, Kiltimagh, New Ross, Portarlington, Roscrea, Shannon, and Templemore.  With the exception of Enniscorthy which was closed on 1 May 2011, the venues listed above were closed on 1 January 2012. The Service has indicated that Ballyconnell, and An Spid&eacute;al  will close on 1 September 2013.<\/p><p>  At its meeting on 1 July 2013, the Courts Service Board approved the closure of venues at Ballyhaunis, Baltinglass, Birr, Clones, Edenderry, Kells, Kinsale, Swinford, I am advised that a date for the closures has not been determined but it is likely that they will close on or before 1 January 2014. , Also at that meeting, the Board decided to defer the decision regarding the future of Skibbereen until the autumn.<\/p><p>  The Service has stated that many of the smaller courthouses around the country have remained in the ownership of the local authorities. In the case of the closure of such a court venue, the building is available to the local authority for alternative use. In the case of the closure of a courthouse building which has been vested in the Courts Service, the Service will consider requests for the transfer of ownership of such buildings to other public bodies. The Service liaises with local authorities and the Office of Public Works about potential alternative uses. In recent years, four courthouses have been transferred to local authorities for use as community facilities, including as an arts centre and a youth cafe.  The Courts Service is currently reviewing its policy on the disposal of property.  There are five courthouse buildings in Courts Service ownership that are not used as court venues. Of those, one  will shortly be transferred to the Office of Public Works and another is in use for storage. In 2012, the total costs associated with the five buildings was &euro;27,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":1555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1556,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[36589\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRQQ02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the frequency of the various orders available to the Courts under the terms of the operation of the Children Act, with breakdown of same.

It represented a major logistical and diplomatic challenge for Ireland which, with the European Commission, acted as lead negotiator and spokesperson for the European Union in the multiple contact groups.<\/p><p>  The two week session addressed a range of important issues relating to forests and economic development including means of implementation for sustainable forest management (SFM) and a number of important emerging issues.  Long and difficult negotiations were a feature of this session as delegates aimed to reflect the core issues of most importance to them in the overall conclusions.  The importance of forests for economic development and on their overall contribution to the green economy was central.  This will facilitate a further rollout of SFM at global level.  This can only benefit all countries, both in the developed and developing worlds. <\/p><p>A multi-stakeholder dialogue and a high level Ministerial segment took place during the first week of the session.  The overall result of the two week session was deemed to be a success by participants and agreement on two action-oriented Draft Resolutions was delivered.  Resolution 1 addresses the implementation of the non-legally binding instrument on forests, regional inputs, economic development and enhanced global cooperation.  The second resolution dealt with agreement on emerging issues, means of implementation and the UNFF Trust Fund.  These will, in due course, go before the UN Economic and Social Council for further action. <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency was particularly challenging in the Forestry arena with many major international events taking place.  In the case of the Istanbul event, it involved months of preparation that entailed developing and coordinating very detailed position papers which successfully captured the European position.  I can justifiably express a feeling of satisfaction with our Presidency&rsquo;s achievements in this complex area. Ireland has left a very sound platform for our EU and other colleagues to work from in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Pension Provisions","counter":1696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1697,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[36365\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in respect of each State agency and commercial State company under the aegis of his Department, if he will provide details of the name of each pension scheme; details of the salary percentage contributions made by the employer and the employees; the latest information on the funding position of the scheme; if any changes are planned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1698,"content":"<p>The details of the pension scheme used by the State agencies and commercial State companies under the aegis of my Department are an operational matter for the bodies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":1699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1700,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[36380\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRUU02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of miles claimed for and the amount of travel expenses paid to him and each Minister of State in his Department in respect of their functions as a Minister in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1701,"content":"<p>The number of kilometres claimed and total travel expenses paid to the Minister of State and I since March 2011, is set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Minister \/Minister of State <\/th><th>Number of Kilometres <\/th><th>Travel Expenses<\/th><th>Subsistence Expenses <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>Minister Coveney <\/td><td>41,806<\/td><td>&euro;14,448.84<\/td><td>&euro;2,762.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>Minister of State -

The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.  I would point to the fact that my Department continues to provide funding to the CCCs which are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  My Department also provides annual funding to the seven National Voluntary Organisations, including Childminding Ireland, to provide support at local level to their members.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.  Work on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is already underway in my Department.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to six years.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.

It is expected that the programme this year will cost up to &euro;175 million when all of the costs are taken into account.

No specific cost analysis has been commissioned in relation to the provision of a second free pre-school year.  However, it is estimated that the additional costs of providing a second year would be similar to the costs incurred in providing the one year free pre-school provision.

The number is currently operational in 23 EU countries and the number has been allocated and is soon to be operational in a further four countries, including Croatia, the newest EU Member State.  In Ireland the 116000 Missing Children Hotline is operated by the ISPCC in liaison with a cross-sectoral Project Team, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Funding for the operation of the line in Ireland is provided by my Department and the EU, through its Daphne funding stream.  My Department provided &euro;50,000 in 2012 and &euro;88,000 in 2013 and the funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from my Department includes; the establishment costs, national promotion and advertisement of the service.  In common with all Exchequer funding, requirements for the operation of the service in future years will be considered in the context of the usual Estimates process.  The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a limited hours pilot basis in Ireland since December 2012 and on a full-time 24\/7 basis since end April, 2013. The service was officially launched on 7 June 2013.<\/p><p>  A key component of the service is a successful awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  During the initial set-up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The successful launch of the service on 7 June 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the service.  The 116000 Missing Children Hotline website, <i>www.missingchildrenhotline.ie<\/i>, has also been launched to promote the service.  To date, an amount of some &euro;35,000 has been spent on awareness measures.  This amount will be doubled for further awareness measures in the remainder of 2013.  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRWW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":1745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1746,"qnumday":633,"qnumall":"[36005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total cost to the Health Service Executive incurred paying for legal representation for guardian ad litems for each of the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Funding of &euro;53.498m, which includes &euro;1.75m capital funding, has been made available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work projects and services provided by the voluntary youth work sector. It is estimated that some 400,000 young people participate in the programmes and services which are provided by approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. Since its establishment, my Department has provided funding for the youth sector as follows:  2011: &euro;60.954m which includes &euro;800,000 capital funding and  2012: &euro;58.306m which includes &euro;1.5m capital funding.<\/p><p>  My Department, as with all Government Departments, has been required to achieve significant savings in recent years, with consequent reductions in funding in all  major programmes on account of the economic challenges facing the country at this time. The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for the Youth Affairs budget from 2012 to 2014 inclusive amount to &euro;11.987m. In implementing the savings required,  I and my Department have tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. I have asked youth organisations and projects to consider the scope for reducing administration and overhead costs as far as is possible and to focus the services for those young people who are most vulnerable. <\/p><p>  I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try to identify ways to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.  There are ongoing meetings at official level with youth sector organisations to share information on the challenges facing services and young people.<\/p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this review will inform the future development of youth programmes and services. <\/p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote coordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. <\/p><p>  The breakdown of  funding is not available in the format requested by the Deputy. The Youth Affairs Unit administers funding to some 30 funding bodies including the Education and Training Boards and other agencies.  A breakdown of funding per funding body in recent years is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":1755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1756,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[36259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total cost and details of the travel expenses the Health Service Executive incurred paying for travelling expenses for guardian ad litems for each of the past five years;

","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1776,"content":"<p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland is the central authority in Ireland for intercountry adoption. Agencies are accredited by the Adoption Authority to provide mediation services in relation to intercountry adoption to assist prospective adoptive parents with the adoption process in respect of particular countries.  The operation of such bodies is seen as an additional safeguard for countries in the conduct of the adoption process and is considered good practice by the Hague authorities.  Monitoring and oversight of these agencies is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority. <\/p><p>There are currently three agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority for intercountry adoption purposes.  All three were established on a non-profit basis and, although accredited by the Adoption Authority, they are not public bodies. The financial model underpinning the operation of these agencies was based upon the recoupment of costs from prospective adoptive parents at the different stages of the process.   However, due to trends in adoption world wide, the numbers of adoptions upon which the plans and financial projections of these agencies were developed have not materialised. International developments have also seen an increase in the time taken to complete an adoption.  These trends and developments have raised questions for the sustainability of these agencies in their current format.  <font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/p><p>I have met with these agencies and discussed the situation.  My interest, which is shared by the agencies, is to achieve a solution which responds to the current situation but also assists in introducing the changes required to resolve the underlying issues of sustainability.  My Department has now undertaken an examination of the policy considerations relating to agencies accredited for mediation purposes and the operational and financial situation of the three agencies.  Government has considered the conclusions of this examination.  An important conclusion reached is that there is a strong public policy rationale for public funding contributing towards core organisation costs of mediation services as part of a mixed system of funding.  This mixed funding would also entail the recoupment of specific costs from prospective adoptive parents reflecting the level of service provision related to individual cases.  A commitment in principle to public funding is an important development since up to now the provision of funding has been once-off and temporary in nature.  Such a commitment recognises the additional safeguards which such accredited agencies provide in the conduct of the adoption process.  It also recognises that increasingly countries of origin require that adoptions are mediated through accredited bodies.<\/p><p>However, public funding also demands that organisational arrangements provide value for money and avoid unnecessary duplication.  Therefore, Government has also agreed that significant cost efficiencies on the current three agency model are required.  The decline in the numbers of children eligible for adoption and the responsibility to ensure effective use of public funding for core organisational costs mean significant revision to current arrangements will need to be introduced in the coming months to reduce duplication or unnecessary expenditure.<\/p><p>In the context of the need for reforms to be introduced in this area I have sought and received Government approval to provide transitional funding to the end of 2013 to the three existing agencies, in advance of the development and implementation of revised arrangements next year which will provide a more sustainable model for the future. Provision of this funding is based upon the positive participation of the agencies in developing the revised arrangements.  <\/p><p>I am very happy to advise that the agencies have willingly given commitments to actively engage in developing revised arrangements and my Department, the Adoption Authority and the HSE are working closely with the agencies on a revised model with the objective of introducing new arrangements from 2014.  Enhanced cooperation between the three agencies is also to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>Further detailed work and significant change will be required. An important consideration will be continuity of service provision especially in relation to access to particular countries of choice for prospective adoptive parents. I am pleased with the progress made to date in successfully addressing the immediate financial challenges faced by the agencies and look forward to the continued co-operation of the Adoption Authority and the AAI and accredited agencies with the efforts of my Department in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Pension Provisions","counter":1777,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1778,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[36367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRXX03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"in respect of each State agency and commercial State company under the aegis of her Department, if she will provide details of the name of each pension scheme; details of the salary percentage contributions made by the employer and the employees; the latest information on the funding position of the scheme; if any changes are planned","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1779,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy there are four agencies which are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote.

The areas I have identified are:<\/p><p>-  Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5<\/p><p>-  Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum <\/p><p>-  Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards<\/p><p>-  Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services <\/p><p>-  Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/p><p>-  Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible<\/p><p>-  Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/p><p>-  Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance<\/p><p>  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.<\/p><p>  The  ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare\/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare\/early education field.  <\/p><p>  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. <\/p><p>  While I recognise the valuable experience which many childcare staff may have accrued, it is now essential that all staff have qualifications on a formal recognised basis.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  <\/p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   <\/p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.

This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.<\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRYY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Numbers","counter":1800,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRYY01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1801,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[36652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRYY01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of social workers currently employed by her Department; and if this figure is in line with previous commitments ","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1802,"content":"<p>Figures supplied by the HSE, from its census of employment in the public health and social care sector, indicate that the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the HSE Children and Families service area was 1,397 at the end of June 2013, which is the latest date for which figures are available.<\/p><p>  The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of re-classification of social workers within the HSE into various care groups, including children and families, as part of the process of establishing the Child and Family Agency.

They are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.

This new funding model will mean that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  <\/p><p>  A pilot prospective funding programme has been in place for certain elective orthopaedic work (four DRGs covering primary hip and knee replacements) since July 2011.  Seven hospitals initially participated with a further five hospitals joining from January 2012.  The pilot operates by reducing current budgets by an amount of money that relates to the four DRGs.  This portion of the budget is then &ldquo;earned&rdquo; back based on work carried out in the hospital.  There is no change to any other portion of the hospital budget.  <\/p><p>  The project has been reviewed twice, with the most recent report completed in December 2012.  This report highlighted a number of efficiency related benefits including significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  While the level of improvement varied across the different hospitals and the different DRGs, all showed significant improvements in these key determinants of hospital efficiency and productivity.  <\/p><p>  This pilot is the first example of Money Follows the Patient in operation in Irish hospitals and is a useful exercise in highlighting the benefits that can accrue as a result of these types of funding arrangements.  It also provides useful lessons in terms of systems and process requirements as well as the need for stakeholder buy-in ahead of roll-out to the wider hospital system.  It is intended that the orthopaedic project will continue until the end of the year at which time the aim is to commence full phased implementation of MFTP.  <\/p><p>  While it is not possible to specify a percentage increase in efficiency that will result when MFTP is rolled out across all public hospitals, I am confident that its introduction will drive efficiencies in similar areas to those evident in the orthopaedic project.  This will help to deliver a more efficient and productive hospital system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDDD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":1941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDDD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1942,"qnumday":699,"qnumall":"[36424\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDDD00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the savings realised from the administration of vaccines by pharmacists as opposed to general practitioners; if other potential opportunities for transfer of duties have been explored; the potential savings identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1943,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[36614\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WRDDD00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the savings that would be achieved from transferring responsibility for administration of seasonal flu vaccine to community pharmacists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1944,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 699 and 732 together.<\/p><p>  Regulations were introduced in October 2011 to provide a legal basis for community pharmacists to supply and administer seasonal influenza vaccine.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I have updated the Taoiseach on this matter and we expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREEE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2007,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREEE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2008,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[36558\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800047#WREEE02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied)","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2009,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The Directive also provided that the ongoing effects of its implementation be monitored by the European Commission.  Following a number of studies on the Directive&rsquo;s effects, in October 2012 the Commission published a proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive.  The Commission included a proposal that foodcrop-based biofuels should, at most, comprise half of the 10% quota required to come from renewable energy sources.  This proposal, in conjunction with the incentives for advanced (next-generation) biofuels, signals the desire of the Commission to move towards the use of advanced biofuels made from feedstocks which do not compete with the production of food.  While Member States agree that the issue must be addressed, it remains an extremely complex matter, and agreement has not yet been reached on the 5% cap.

Along with our EU partners, Ireland strongly condemns extra-judicial killings.

This applies regardless of the means used.  The EU has consistently argued the case internationally that combating terrorism must be conducted in full compliance with and respect for international law, in particular the law of armed conflict and human rights law.

To estimate the potential yield from a Stamp Duty on probate, one would need to identify the value of all estates in probate, which is not possible from the data available at present.  I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, that probate is a legal process whereby a grant of representation is issued by the High Court Probate Office or District Probate Registry in respect of a deceased person's estate.  The grant of representation gives legal authority to a person or persons to access the estate and administer it in accordance with the law.  The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.<\/p><p>  Where a Grant of Representation in a deceased person&rsquo;s estate is extracted, it is subject to a Court Fee.  The Court Fee in question is calculated in accordance with the Supreme and High Court (Fees) Order (S.I. 239 of 2013) and is assessed on the basis of the value of the net estate of the deceased person.  The Courts Service has advised that in 2012 fees of &euro;1,860,967 were collected in respect of applications to the High Court Probate Office for Grants of Probate and administration.  Details of the fee income collected in the 14 District Probate Registries are not readily available.<\/p><p>  A Probate Tax on estates was introduced by Finance Act 1993.  The tax treated the estate of a deceased person as an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators of the estate.  The net estate &ndash; that is, the assets of the deceased valued at the date of death, less liabilities at the date of death and reasonable funeral expenses &ndash; was deemed to be an inheritance taken by the executors or administrators.  The rate of Probate Tax applied to the net estate was 2%.  One of the main difficulties with Probate Tax was that it had to be paid prior to the grant of probate or administration.  As funds in an estate cannot be released until after the grant, the imposition of probate tax placed a severe cash-flow burden on executors or administrators of estates who, if other funds were not available, had to arrange borrowings to discharge the liability.  In many cases, this caused hardship for estates that had no liquid assets and where sales of property took time.  Probate Tax was abolished by Finance Act 2001.<\/p><p>  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) was introduced in 1976 and includes both gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT is an acquisitions tax that imposes a tax charge on individuals after they receive gifts or inheritances.  The charge arises at a time when the person is in a position to pay the CAT on the gift or on the inheritance, because s\/he is in possession of the benefit received.  CAT is therefore considered a more appropriate form of taxation of inheritances.  I do not intend to reintroduce a Probate Tax on estates or a Stamp Duty on probate.  However the Deputies may be aware that the rate of CAT on inheritances has been increased from 20% in 1999 to the current rate of 33%, and the tax-free thresholds have been considerably reduced since 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800049#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":2206,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[35989\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800049#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a non-means tested State pension is fully exempt from the universal social charge; if the non-means tested State pension was subject to a USC, the amount it would realise for the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1093","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":2207,"content":"<p>The position is that the Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.    Payments that are made under the Social Welfare Acts are and have always been specifically excluded from liability to USC. Accordingly, all State contributory and non-contributory pensions are exempt from the charge.  I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that certain payments, which are of a similar character to social welfare payments, are also exempt from universal social charge. A list of such payments is included at Appendix A, page 49, of the FAQs relating to the universal social charge published by the Revenue Commissioners and available at http:\/\/www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax\/usc\/universal-social-charge-faqs.pdf.<\/p><p>  To estimate the potential yield from applying the USC to non-means tested State Pensions i.e. the contributory State Pension and the State Pension (Transition) it would be necessary to identify certain details in respect of each recipient of social protection payments such as the individual amount of these payments received, the amount of any other income potentially liable to USC, the age of each individual and whether there was an entitlement to a medical card etc.  This information would be essential to determine what rate of USC would apply at an individual level.  It is possible that in many cases the rate would be low. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they do hold or have access to the required information set out above, there is no basis on which an estimate of the yield from the change mentioned in the question could be compiled.  However, by way of illustration, if for example, a 1 per cent levy was imposed on social protection contributory State Pensions and the State Pension (Transition) the full year yield to the Exchequer would be &euro;41 million on the basis that the estimated provision for such payments in 2013 is approximately &euro;4.1 billion. The estimate of Exchequer yield assumes that there is no exemption threshold, allowance or personal reliefs that could be used to offset against the levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800049#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":2208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800049#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2209,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[35991\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800049#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the 24 safety deposit boxes remaining in Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, if owners have been identified for them all; the length of time each box was with either Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide; the gross value of the remaining contents; the period of time after which the contents come into the ownership of IBRC or the State; if any safety deposit boxes have gone missing; and the value of any contents that went missing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Member States under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality, and must be seen in the context of the very significant debt restructuring that has taken place in the Greek programme. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country close to exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. <\/p><p>  We have, during 2013, returned to the international debt markets.

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.   There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no such single internationally agreed methodology to calculate the effective rate of corporation tax, there is no reliable basis upon which to calculate the current 'effective rate' of corporate tax in Ireland without being potentially misleading.  <\/p><p>  Therefore, neither I, nor my Department, would be in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.<\/p><p>  To illustrate the debate on the topic, I have previously referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013<\/i>).  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p>  I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but they do indicate that the 'effective' rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is already much higher than the 6% minimum 'effective' rate the Deputy suggests.<\/p><p>  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  <\/p><p>  We therefore have only a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focused firstly, on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The small number of reliefs we have include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800051#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":2268,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[36055\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800051#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of additional revenue increasing capital gains tax to 40% in budget 2014 would yield for the Exchequer.

The Chancellor made some references to Ulster Bank in the context of the future orientation of RBS in dealing with the future of the two UK banks in which the British Exchequer has a significant shareholding.  Last Friday, the UK Treasury announced the appointment of BlackRock Solutions as asset specialist advisor to the review.

Ulster Bank described itself as the number three player in the Republic of Ireland with 1.3m customers- 1.26 m Retail and 80,000 Corporate. It informed investors that it has a clear strategy to create a &lsquo;Really Good Bank&rsquo; whilst tackling legacy issues; it intends to deliver a smaller, lower cost and profitable bank. Ulster Bank confirmed that it is &lsquo;cautiously optimistic&rsquo; about the Irish market. Data published at the end of June show that, having returned to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of growth in 2012, with GDP expanding modestly by 0.2 per cent. Ulster Bank is correct in seeing that Ireland is a place where the banking sector can expect to achieve returns which are acceptable to investors. <\/p><p>  The recent successful launch by BlueBay Asset Management LLP (BlueBay) and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) of a new vehicle that will provide loans to larger SMEs and mid-sized businesses in Ireland also shows that positive sentiment has returned.

Appointments are made where it is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome for both the customer and the bank. The appointment of a Receiver is currently pending on 3 BTL properties (3 accounts). <\/p><p>  - A Receiver is appointed by the bank and operates as an agent of the borrower, assuming the role of property landlord in many respects. The Receiver collects rent from the tenant(s) and passes it to the bank, together with attending to any property related issues the tenant may have (in accordance with the Lease Agreement). The appointment of a Receiver should not negatively impact the tenant(s) as the Receiver effectively steps into the shoes of the landlord.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums. <\/p><p>  Based on certain assumptions the average annual industrial wage is estimated at about &euro;31,500 in 2012. As there is no general requirement for data on retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;31,500, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000. Furthermore, details of the marginal rate of income tax an individual would pay on a taxable lump sum pension payment in the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not available.<\/p><p>  Based on broad assumptions and an extrapolation of certain available data in relation to the public service, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;31,500 and over at the higher income tax rate of 41% could be about &euro;100 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  Similarly, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;80,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;20 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  Finally, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;100,000 and over at 41% could be about &euro;10 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any new tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800057#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":2541,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[36745\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800058#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money that would be raised in a full year by confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confine tax relief for the public service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1181","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":2542,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate &mdash; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.

From next year, all assessed taxpayers, that is, taxpayers who are in the self-assessment system, will be liable to PRSI on their full incomes including rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings. <\/p><p>  I should point out that PRSI is a matter for the Department of Social Protection in the first instance.

The marginal rate for each of these levies was 6% and 5%, respectively, or 11% in total.  The marginal rate for the USC was 7%.  Taken in isolation the introduction of the USC, therefore, would have had the effect of reducing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners paying at those rates.  At the same time, the PRSI ceiling for PAYE taxpayers, which then stood at &euro;75,036, was abolished which had the result of increasing by 4 percentage points the top marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers.  So the two changes - the introduction of the USC and the abolition of the PRSI ceiling-taken together meant that the marginal tax rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged.<\/p><p>  In the case of the self-employed, the PRSI income ceiling for the self-employed had been abolished in Budget 2001.  Therefore, without further change, the introduction of the USC would have reduced the top marginal rate for these taxpayers by 4 percentage points and would have had the unintended effect of benefiting high earning self-employed income earners, resulting in some high earning self-employed income earners actually making a gain from Budget 2011 in comparison to all other taxpayers.    <\/p><p>  To avoid the situation in which the top marginal rate for PAYE taxpayers remained unchanged while self-employed taxpayers benefited from a reduction of that rate by 4 percentage points, two further changes were made. A higher rate of USC of 10% was introduced for the self-employed in respect of income in excess of &euro;100,000 and an additional 1 percentage point was added to the self-employed PRSI rate.  This restored the self-employed top marginal tax rate to 55%, (41% income tax, 7% USC, an additional 3% USC on income over &euro;100,000 and 4% PRSI).<\/p><p>  Note (i): the 'marginal' rate of tax equates to the top rate of tax which an individual is paying.<\/p><p>  Note (ii): the 10% rate of USC only applies to income over &euro;100,000.

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.<\/p><p>  At post primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from &euro;2,550 to &euro;10,065 for day pupils.<\/p><p>  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013.<\/p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.<\/p><p>  There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.<\/p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe\/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.<\/p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision. The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.<\/p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations are considered on a case by case basis. Applications in this regard require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home. Therefore there is no maximum number of siblings that will be required to share home based tuition.<\/p><p>  Parents who are experiencing difficulties in sourcing a fully qualified teacher have been advised to contact the officials dealing with their allocation as tutors with alternative qualifications and experience may be accepted in some instances, as has been the practice in previous years. Although the timeframe is short my officials have endeavoured to process any appeals or queries on tutor qualifications expeditiously.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.   A wide consultation process will be a feature of the preparation of the advice and I have specifically requested the NCSE to consult widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties.  The NCSE has commissioned research which will also inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.

In the 2012 Survey  of Schools: ICT in Education, which was carried out by European Schoolnet, on  behalf of the European Commission, the frequency of use of ICT in lessons was  examined. The survey showed that the use of ICT by teachers in Ireland is much  higher at all grades than the EU average. There are considerable more teachers  using ICT in more than 25% of lessons, which is above the EU average,  particularly at grades 4 (4th class) and 8 (2nd year post primary).

In 2012 13,500 teacher training places were taken up on  ICT related training.

These are detailed below. <\/p><p>  A 5-year School Investment Plan 2012-2016 announced on 9 March 2012, provides  for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5  billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance  needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement  initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works.  <\/p><p>  The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant  demographic changes have been identified.  There are 275 projects set out in  the Plan that are expected to proceed to construction over the duration of the  Plan - 106 new school buildings and 65 extensions at primary level; 43 new  school buildings and 49 extensions at second level, and 8 new special school  buildings and extensions at 4 further special schools   In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects to commence  construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December  2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence  construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan. <\/p><p>To ensure that accommodation is available when required, my Department has  initiated alternative methods of project delivery whereby responsibility for  planning and delivery of projects is devolved to Local Authorities, Education  and Training Boards, NDFA, OPW and directly to school authorities.  <\/p><p>  Following on from the success of the 2012 prefab replacement scheme which  provided funding for the replacement of over 458 prefab units, I recently  announced that a further 46 schools would be offered grants in 2013 to build  permanent accommodation to replace 115 prefabs, subject to the schools meeting  certain criteria. The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the  highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the development of an inventory of education infrastructure and  related community assets, my Department undertook a pilot study in five areas  in the country. The geographic areas included for the pilot study were Tuam,  Navan, Clonmel, Portlaoise, and part of Limerick City.  The research  information gathered from this pilot study was in a format compatible with  current Department information systems, such as the Geographic Information  System (GIS). This allows my Department to overlay the new information such as  site maps, floor plans and other data on to its current GIS mapping system.  It  is the intention that this expanded inventory data will now be developed on an  incremental basis at a national level.  <\/p><p>  In June 2011, I announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established up to  2017 to cater for increasing demographics across a number of locations. These  will include shared campus arrangements where appropriate and possible. Some  examples of campus arrangements include the campus development in Monaghan town  which provided a primary school, a gaelchol&aacute;iste and a further education  facility.  A campus development in Naas provided a post primary school, a  primary gaelscoil and a headquarters building for the IVEA.   <\/p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is included among the  prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to  send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for  comment and sites are reserved, where necessary, under this process to ensure  as far as possible the timely delivery of any required education infrastructure <\/p><p>  Following the disappointing response from the Congregations to augment their  contributions under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, following the publication of  the Ryan Report, I proposed the transfer of school infrastructure to the State  at no cost to the Exchequer for the benefit of the taxpayer as one mechanism to  allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs.

However, in the light of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's responsibility in this area, there are no plans to establish dedicated arrangements in respect of this sector.  It should be noted that F&Aacute;S has recently developed a small number of foundation level courses in catering and hospitality through its Local Training Initiatives, Community Training Centres and Specialist Training Providers.  These awards\/modules are offered in response to specific local requests where there is a recognised employment opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Educational Disadvantage","counter":2698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2699,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[36761\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has any advice to offer to the boards of management of DEIS band primary schools in Tallaght, Dublin 24 in relation to funding (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils. As part of the DEIS programme a total of &euro;69.1m is being provided to 665 primary schools supporting 100,595 pupils and some 930 additional teacher posts. This funding provides for Reduced Class Sizes; Home School Community Liaison Service; Support Teacher Project; DEIS and Book Grants to individual schools. DEIS Schools are also targeted for supports provided under the Department of Social Protection Schools Meals Programmes (&euro;34m) and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs School Completion Programme (&euro;26.4m). My Department continues to work to ensure that DEIS funding is used effectively. For example, it has recently provided guidelines on the appropriate use of DEIS grant funding in primary and post primary schools, emphasising a number of recommended activities such as at least 10% of DEIS grant to be allocated to Home School Community Liaison activities.<\/p><p>  Some of the additional DEIS grant may also be used to meet ancillary costs such as heating, lighting and other miscellaneous charges related to extended openings of school buildings remaining open to cater for clubs and after school activities. The 22 DEIS schools in Tallaght will receive &euro;0.715 million in DEIS grants in 2013\/14 school year. Schools have been given the autonomy to work within the guidelines for the appropriate use of DEIS funding and to decide how best to utilise DEIS resources, including the DEIS grant to achieve maximum benefits to the most at risk pupils in line with their DEIS Action Plans and addressing educational disadvantage. These guidelines, which issued in October 2012, now place emphasis on outcomes rather than being too prescriptive in relation to recommended activities and interventions. Information on the full range of supports provided to DEIS schools is available on the Social Inclusion section of my Departments website at following link .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2701,"content":"<p>Question No. 249 answered with Question No. 208.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Grants","counter":2702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2703,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[36770\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the provisions whereby the grant aid of post graduate study is limited to four years, even in the case where no grant has previously been awarded and if this criteria can be reviewed for 2013-2014 in view of the emphasis on high quality training and the smart economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following discussion between Ryanair, CWT and the National Procurement Service, agreement was reached on a fixed one-way fare of &euro;49.99 for travel between Dublin and Brussels South Charleroi for the duration of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. The fare included government taxes and charges, but did not include fees for baggage or for extras such as reserved seating or priority boarding. This fare was subject to a 2% credit card fee. It could be booked either online or by telephone, with a &euro;6 administration fee per person per sector for bookings made by telephone. The agreement also allowed for one change to be made to a booked ticket to an alternative flight of the passenger&rsquo;s choice on the same route. Ryanair also committed to providing an Assistance Desk at both of the airports concerned for any assistance required by travellers availing of this fare. The agreement applied only to the Dublin - Brussels South Charleroi route. This special fare was available to all officials and Oireachtas members travelling to Brussels on official business during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. Other options available to travellers to Brussels are the Aer Lingus service between Dublin and Brussels Airport and the standard fares available from Ryanair. In planning journeys, travellers would take account of the suitability of flight times, having regard to the timing and duration of the relevant meetings in Brussels. A further factor to be considered by Departments\/Offices in choosing flights is the ground transport links from the particular airport regarding access and cost. For those officials whose work\/meetings schedule allowed them to use this route, the Ryanair offer provided value for money. As a result of Ryanair's offers, significant reductions were achieved in the average cost of flights to Brussels when compared with the same period in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Valuation Process","counter":2711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2712,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[36061\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will list by urban rateable area, broken down by business type in tabular form the number of appeals to rate valuations received to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":2713,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Valuation Office has been conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the Waterford rating authority areas (Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council) and in the Dublin City rating authority as part of its ongoing programme to revalue all such properties in the State. This has resulted in the issue of Proposed Valuation Certificates to the ratepayers in relation to their property. However this process is not yet complete in Waterford as a small batch of outstanding Certificates will issue shortly. Ratepayers may make representations to the Valuation Manager if they consider that the proposed valuation or any details contained in the Proposed Certificate are incorrect. The representation stage is currently under way and will not be complete for some time. Following the processing of the representations to the Valuation Manager, the Final Certificates of Valuation will be published on 31st December, 2013, when each ratepayer in Waterford and Dublin City will have a statutory right to make an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal if dissatisfied with the outcome of their representations. The Valuation Tribunal is an independent body set up to settle disputed valuations between the Commissioner of Valuation and the ratepayers of local authorities. Therefore, it will be early 2014, before the appeal stage is reached in respect of the Waterford and Dublin City rating authorities, accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed statistical information which the Deputy is seeking at this stage. Under the Valuation Act, 2001, there is also a right of internal appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation.

The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. The approach of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and that any change in rates does not impact negatively on businesses and employment. It is important that local government reform drives down costs to business in order to protect existing jobs and sustain our economic competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":2718,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[36131\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800062#WRS01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"with respect to determination of commercial rates by the Valuation Office, if he will outline details of the rolling programme of valuation undertaken by the office; when each area of the country is assessed and in what order; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":2719,"content":"<p>The Valuation Office is currently undertaking a systematic programme of revaluing, for rates purposes, all industrial and commercial properties in the State.

Revaluation is conducted across all relevant properties in one or more rating authority areas at the same time. However, implementation of the national programme cannot occur across the entire country simultaneously and the programme must, accordingly, be operated on a phased basis.

Steady progress is being made on the National Revaluation Programme. Between 2007 and 2010 the three Rating Authority areas of South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown were revalued comprising c.17,700 commercial properties which represents approximately 22% of the national rateable valuation base.

The site opens to the public on a fulltime basis 362 days per year, attracting significant numbers of visitors and sustaining a strong income profile.  As well as its tourist and heritage attractiveness to visitors, it is also the preferred chosen venue for frequent formal events and functions of social, cultural, artistic, civic and diplomatic significance.

This is the first time that a Directive on concessions has been developed as until now regulation at European level has been only partially developed. The Directives aim at simplifying the rules around procurement procedures, reducing the administrative burden on public authorities and potential contractors; thereby attracting a greater number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well as reducing the costs of procuring and contributing to a better use of resources. I welcome this agreement as it will strengthen the generation of jobs and growth, given that public authorities across the European Union spend approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum (some 19% of EU GDP) on the procurement of goods, services and works. The easier access to such contracts for SMEs is a fundamental criterion- there are over 20 million SMEs in Europe, accounting for more than 98% of all enterprises&ndash;their exclusion from such contracts made little economic sense. The simplified administrative framework will mean the inclusion of smaller businesses for contracts that have always been clearly within their capacity to perform.<\/p><p>  The agreement also includes incentives for authorities to divide their requirements in lots &ndash;something which will also further attract SMEs. The gains to be had by such revisions are not confined to industry alone-by increasing and broadening access to such contracts we are helping to create competition, to drive efficiencies and ensure the public monies are being used in a cost-effective manner to provide for public need but at the same time support job creation and innovation. The negotiations were detailed, lengthy and complex, requiring significant compromise on the part of all three institutions.

The Deputy's scenario in respect of the PRD would be particularly challenging in terms of costing on account of its complexity. This complexity arises from recourse to an eight-band tiered deduction structure instead of the current four-band structure, significant departures from existing band boundaries, and both increases and decreases in the percentage rates. Furthermore, it is possible that the Exchequer would experience net losses, not net savings, under the proposal, given that substantial rate reductions are proposed on the first &euro;60,000 of salary.<\/p><p>  As already indicated, my Department is not in a position to supply a detailed costing in relation to the PSPR adjustments which the Deputy has proposed. However, by drawing on previously undertaken costings work, it is possible to ascribe an approximate order-of-magnitude savings figure of a further &euro;5 million to the PSPR proposals made by the Deputy. This approximate and tentative &euro;5 million PSPR savings estimate arises very substantially from the Deputy's proposal in Question No. 36459\/13 in respect of pensions awarded up to the end of February 2012.

These Council Conclusions represent important steps in defining the future landscape of the European Space effort. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and of the European Space Agency, and the contribution which these partners make to economic growth and competitiveness.  Progress was also made on the proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) support programme which will ensure the security of satellite data for all sectors and users of such services. Initial discussions also took place on a proposed Regulation on Copernicus &ndash; the European Union&rsquo;s Flagship satellite-based earth monitoring programme.  <\/p><p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &ldquo;Establishing appropriate relations between the EU and the European Space Agency&rdquo;, adopted in November 2012, proposed several options for the evolution of this relationship. Council Conclusions on EU\/ESA relations adopted under the Irish Presidency on 18 February 2013 requested the Commission to work closely with ESA to carry out a comprehensive cost benefit analysis and impact assessment of a set of options, including those proposed in the Commission&rsquo;s Communication. At the Competitiveness Council meeting in May the Commission presented an information paper updating the Council on the status of its reflections on the evolution of EU-ESA relations. The Commission informed the Council that it had commenced an in-depth study of the options for the evolution of this relationship and informed the Council that the first results of this study are expected to be presented to Member States towards the end of this year. <\/p><p>Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s Communication on &quot;EU Space Industrial Policy - Releasing the Potential for Economic Growth in the Space Sector&quot; adopted on 28 February 2013 Council Conclusions on this Communication were adopted at the Competitiveness Council on 30 May. These Conclusions represent a significant advancement in defining European Space policy. They recognise the strategic importance of space for Europe, its growing role in modern society, the importance of the space industry and its contribution to economic growth and competitiveness. Ireland&rsquo;s space strategy is to build a sustainable, knowledge intensive and export focused space industry in Ireland, leading to increased levels of exports, sales and employment, to support strategic research in Irish third level institutions and to promote the use of space based systems for commercial and wider societal needs. While this is achieved mainly through Ireland&rsquo;s participation and investment in the European Space Agency (ESA), this will be further supported by the EU space industrial policy.<\/p><p>  Under the Irish Presidency the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Space Surveillance and Tracking Support Programme adopted on 28 February 2013 was examined at meetings of the Space Working Party between March and May. Space surveillance and tracking is of critical interest to countries with space assets and while Ireland has no space assets at present we are critically dependent on the security of satellite data for all sectors, actors and users of satellite-based services. The proposed SST service will increase the safety of satellite operations by reducing collision risks and helping to better predict uncontrolled re-entries of inactive satellites or space debris and increase European non-dependence levels.   Member States expressed support for the proposal, however, a number also expressed concern in relation to certain security, financing and governance aspects of the proposal. The Presidency worked intensively to progress the proposal, however, full agreement on the text was not possible and on this basis the Irish Presidency presented a Progress Report on the status of negotiations to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May.<\/p><p>  The Commission adopted the Copernicus Regulation on 29 May 2013 and the proposal was presented to the Competitiveness Council on 30 May and was also presented to the Space Working Party on 7 June for an initial exchange of views. Copernicus is the new name for the European Earth Observation Programme GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security). Copernicus is a European initiative for the implementation of information services dealing with environment and security. Copernicus is based on observation data received from Earth Observation satellites and ground based information. The overall objective of the Copernicus initiative is to support Europe&rsquo;s goals regarding sustainable development and global governance of the environment by providing timely and quality data, information, services and knowledge. Through Copernicus the state of our environment and its short, medium and long-term evolution will be monitored to support policy decisions or investments.  Copernicus will provide services in six sectors: Marine monitoring, Atmosphere monitoring, Climate change monitoring, Land monitoring, Emergency management and Security. A number of Government Departments, agencies and organisations have an interest in aspects of the proposal as potential users of the system and Copernicus will also provide opportunities for commercial applications in the downstream sector based on full and open access to Copernicus observation data and information products. This ambitious Earth observation programme is headed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Environment Agency and the European Space Agency and will enter its full operational phase in 2014.<\/p><p>  The achievements of the Irish Presidency in the development of European Space Policy will contribute to the development of a strong and competitive European space industry and will provide further support to Irish industrial space interests and provide opportunities for growth particularly in the SME sector which encompasses the majority of Irish space companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800064#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Companies Law Issues","counter":2801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800065#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2802,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[36168\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800065#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the company law (accounting) directive between EU member states will reduce an administrative burden for small and medium enterprises in the long run, but in the short and medium term, if he sees this changeover to be burdensome to Irish small and medium-sized enterprises; his views on whether now is the correct time to be making these changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Once block exempted, certain aid can be brought into place by Member States without seeking prior permission from the Commission. <\/p><p>  The ninth and final meeting of the Competition Working Party took place on 07 May 2013. The Competition Working Party noted the support for a large majority of delegations for the two Presidency compromise texts. The Permanent Representatives Committee approved the Presidency compromise texts on both Regulations on 15 May 2013 and invited the Council (Competitiveness) at its meeting on 29 May 2013 to proceed to a public debate with a view to the subsequent adoption of the two Council Regulations. <\/p><p>  Because of the high political importance of State Aid Modernisation, the Presidency proceeded - as the opinions from the European Parliament were not yet adopted - to a General Approach on these two Regulations at the 29 May Competitiveness Council.<\/p><p>  The agreement will ensure more efficient and transparent monitoring of State Aid by the Commission, enhanced data-gathering processes and improved co-operation between the Commission and Member States&rsquo; national courts. The reforms will also enable the Commission to focus on large and potentially distortive State Aids, while simplifying the procedures for &lsquo;good aid&rsquo;.<\/p><p>  Formal adoption of the regulations will now take place under the incoming Lithuanian presidency. The Commission will aim at developing the rest of the package over the following year with a view to progressively achieving the revision of the main Commission acts and guidelines by the end of 2013.

If an employee has earned income from self-employment, PRSI as a self-employed contributor is also payable on the profits from that self-employed activity as well as from any other unearned income the individual may have.  Similarly a self-employed contributor (who is not an employee) pays PRSI on both earned and unearned income.  However if an employee has unearned income only, there is no PRSI charge on the unearned income.  Unearned income includes rental and investment income as well as income from dividends, deposits and savings and from overseas investments. <\/p><p>  In Budget 2013 the Minister for Finance indicated that the income base on which PRSI is charged will be broadened, consequently I introduced the following measures:<\/p><p>  - With effect from 1 January 2013 modified rate contributors with additional earned self-employed income (from a profession or trade) and any other unearned income (such as rental income) became liable to PRSI at the rate of 4% on all such income:<\/p><p>  - In 2014, the exemption from PRSI applying to all employees who have no additional self-employed earned income but who do have unearned income only (such as rental income), will be abolished, such income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. <\/p><p>  Social Insurance applies to persons over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, which is currently age 66 years.

","asker":"1100","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2865,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the challenges facing the trustees and the sponsoring employers of defined benefit pension schemes.  The majority of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and face serious challenges in restoring their funding levels to enable the scheme deliver on the pension promise.  It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem, facing pension schemes is that pensions are significantly more expensive, due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflect in increased annuity rates.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &quot;health&quot; of a scheme can be tested.  When a scheme fails the Funding Standard that means that unless some action is taken, the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised.  The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &quot;promised&quot; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>   In addition to the range of both legislative and administrative measures introduced over the last few years to assist the trustees and sponsoring employers to restore pension provision to a sustainable position, I introduced measures last year to protect scheme members against future volatility in the financial markets.  Defined benefits schemes will be required to maintain a risk reserve with effect from January 2016 and to meet this risk reserve requirement by the end of 2023.   <\/p><p>  It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve will present an added challenge for pension schemes, however, guidance issued by the Regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement. <\/p><p>  The size of the funding standard risk reserve depends on the nature of the assets held by the scheme in question.  The greater the amount of lower risk assets held, the lower the reserve requirement.  The level of the risk reserve was initially set at 15% of holdings other than bonds or cash.  The occupational pension schemes (funding standard reserve) regulations 2013 reduced the risk reserve requirement from 15% to 10% and extended the range of assets which have the effect of reducing the Funding Standard reserve requirement.  These additional measures were put in place to provide further assistance to scheme in restoring the scheme funding position.<\/p><p>  This measure was put in to protect scheme members from exposure to financial volatility and to assist in securing the future sustainability of schemes.  You will be aware that investment losses in Ireland were the largest because of the large share of equities in pension fund portfolios, around two-thirds of assets before the crisis hit, compared with an average of 36% in the 20 OECD countries where data are available.<\/p><p>  There has been a decline in the number of defined benefit schemes over the last decade.  This decline is replicated in many other OECD countries and is referred to in the recent OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System.  The persistent funding difficulties experienced by defined benefit schemes have been well recognised and employers, unions and trustees have been making strenuous efforts to protect the viability of their schemes. While trustees and employers will explore a range of options to secure the sustainability of pension provision, some schemes will wind up.  The level of scheme funding at the date of the wind-up will determine the extent to which the scheme can meet all of its liabilities.  It is recognised that in situations where a scheme is severely under-funded, the expected level of benefit which an active and deferred members of a scheme will receive will be reduced.  Section 48 of the Pensions Act determines the order in which the assets of a scheme are distributed on the wind up of a scheme.  This is an issue which has been examined in some depth and is under consideration at present, along with other defined benefit issues.  I am keeping the situation under review and will report back to Government in the coming months on these issues.  Legislative proposals and additional reforms will be considered at that stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800066#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":2866,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800066#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2867,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[35947\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800066#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a domiciliary care allowance will be approved for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The funding proposal must outline measures which ensure that the scheme could reasonably be expected to satisfy the Funding Standard by 2023 (in line with changes made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012).  Following approval of the funding proposals, schemes report to the Pensions Board on their compliance with the funding proposal on an annual basis<font color=\"#004080\">. <\/font><\/p><p>  The suspension of the Funding Standard in 2008 meant that trustees were not required to submit funding proposals, however some schemes continued to comply during this time.     <\/p><p>  Therefore, not all schemes had to submit funding proposals by the 30th June deadline, depending on the last date of valuation, and some schemes may already have funding proposals in place and approved by the Pensions Board to deal with their deficits. <\/p><p>  With the reinstatement of the Funding Standard, approximately 300 schemes were due to send in funding proposals by the 30th June 2013.  212 of these schemes did not submit funding proposals.   <\/p><p>  The Pensions Board has, by now, formally written to the schemes that have not submitted funding proposals to ascertain their particular circumstances.  The Board will decide what steps to take scheme by scheme on a measured basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances. <\/p><p>  The reason for the delay in trustees responding will become clearer as the Pensions Board engages with schemes individually.  The Funding Standard had been suspended since 2008 with the date extended on a number of occasions, and trustees need to adjust to the fact that the regulatory structure has been reinstated.

There also appeared to be an unfounded expectation that the date would be extended again and this contributed to the number that missed the deadline.   <\/p><p>  Following engagement by the Pensions Board and once pension schemes have submitted their funding proposals, it will then be possible within the coming months for the Board to provide a more accurate indication of the level of under-funding in DB pension schemes.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the full insolvency process. <\/p><p>  The pilot scheme envisages a third party service provider, acting as an intermediary between the borrowers and the lenders, who would look at the borrowers overall debts, issues of affordability of all debts and make agreements with the banks and credit unions on new levels of repayments ( including write downs) etc.<\/p><p>  When the framework was announced the third party service provider hadn&rsquo;t been identified.  Facilitated by the Central Bank, a pilot working group comprising banks, credit unions and lenders bodies has been established to oversee the pilot, a sub group of which examined the proposals, from a number of applicants, submitted to manage the pilot. CIB \/ MABS made a detailed submission outlining how they would manage the pilot if they were successful in becoming the third party service provider. <\/p><p>  The CIB\/MABS proposal was successful and they confirmed to the Central Bank their acceptance of the offer. However at follow up discussions with the lenders to discuss the proposal, CIB \/ MABS, after much consideration, decided that the proposed approach of the lenders was not the best fit for MABS at this particular point in time and notified the Central Bank of the withdrawal of their proposal. MABS felt that the pilot provides for a very specific role for the service provider, which is significantly narrower than MABS current role and provides only a limited facility for MABS to advocate on behalf of clients. <\/p><p>  MABS has communicated its continued commitment to the approach and principles of the pilot and its support of the comprehensive approach to multiple-debt resolution proposed.  Furthermore, MABS is willing to incorporate aspects of the pilot in its own work with borrowers and lenders and has offered to contribute to the work of the Steering Committee for the pilot. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will continue to play an important role and provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800068#WRY00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":2923,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800068#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2924,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[36442\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800068#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the number of amendments to legislation he proposed during committee and report stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2012; if she will provide in tabular form the number of her own amendments accepted; and if she will indicate in tabular form the number of amendments accepted from members of the Seanad, broken down by Senator.","asker":"1075","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2925,"content":"<p>Three Bills were initiated and finalised by the Minister for Social Protection during 2012 - the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, the Social Welfare Bill 2012 and the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012.<\/p><p>  No committee or report stage amendments were proposed by the Minister for Social Protection to any of these Bills in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

While it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time - for example, an unemployed person may become sick - a general principle applies whereby even if a person experiences more than one of the contingencies at any one time, he or she only can receive one primary social welfare payment at any time. <\/p><p>  In relation to those in Budget 2012 introduced changes to a provision whereby those in receipt of widow(er)&rsquo;s pensions, surviving civil partner's pensions or one parent family payment may have been entitled to half rate jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit or incapacity supplement if they satisfied the qualifying conditions.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.

The site is protected by a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts due to its historical importance as the location of the final Council of War and last headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. <\/p><p>  Because of the Preservation Order any works at, or in proximity to, the national monument require my consent under the National Monuments Acts.  As part of the consent process I have undertaken an Environmental Impact Assessment and considered all the various submissions and observations I have received in relation to the proposed works. <\/p><p>  My decision on the consent application approved the applicant's proposals for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre on the site, involving the full repair and conservation of the four buildings.  However, it did not approve the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site which date from or before 1916. Neither did I consent to the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site or to the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16.<\/p><p>  The consent I have given is conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals. <\/p><p>  The Moore Street national monument is of huge significance and importance. It is highly appropriate that it would be preserved and that an appropriate commemorative centre would be put in place to mark the momentous events which took place there.  Having carefully considered all the relevant factors, I believe that the decision I have made on the consent application is the best way to ensure that work can take place to restore and conserve the national monument, to develop an appropriate commemorative centre there and also to ensure that the monument site is fully protected for future generations.<\/p><p>I would hope that the consent applicant can now revise the plans for the Moore Street national monument, in consultation with the planning authority, Dublin City Council, and in line with the conditions that have been set, so that an appropriate commemorative centre can be in place for 2016<i>.<\/i>    I will assist and support that process to the fullest extent possible insofar as my role under the National Monuments Acts is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800072#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":3090,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800072#WRCC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":3091,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[36407\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800072#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to extend the opening hours of the key historical and cultural institutions for the duration of the peak tourist period in Summer and early Autumn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":3092,"content":"<p>My Department and the bodies funded from its Vote Group are committed to maximising the tourism potential and to increasing visitor numbers to Ireland's historical and cultural institutions. <\/p><p>  In this regard, my Department has been liaising with the various cultural institutions to ensure that high quality exhibition programmes are in place in these institutions during the peak tourist period.

The first is a legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who are signing up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years. The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to. This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready or can be made ready for use for domestic turf cutting.<\/p><p>  Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.<\/p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site, for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site, then the Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.<\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, it is the absolute aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one. That is what my officials are working to achieve, and progress is being made in that task.

The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters.

A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &#8220;cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.&#8221;<\/p><p>  The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List   for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:<\/p><p>  - The Burren;<\/p><p>  - C&eacute;ide Fields and North West Mayo Boglands;<\/p><p>  - The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; <\/p><p>  - The Historic City of Dublin;<\/p><p>  - Early Medieval Monastic Sites (Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra, Kells and Monasterboice);<\/p><p>  - The Royal Sites of Ireland (Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan Complex, Tara Complex and potentially Navan Fort in Armagh);<\/p><p>  - Western Stone Forts (Aran Islands - 7 forts, Cahercommaun, The Burren, Caherconree, Staigue, Benagh and Dingle Peninsula.<\/p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:<\/p><p>  - the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS); <\/p><p>  - the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and <\/p><p>  - the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).<\/p><p>  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site's inclusion on the World Heritage List.  <\/p><p>  I believe that there are significant economic and cultural benefits to be gained from having additional Irish sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage list. I also share UNESCO's view that the nomination process must be driven at a local level and enjoy strong support amongst the communities within the potential world heritage areas.  In order to further progress the nomination process for the sites on the current Tentative List, I have arranged a seminar in the Autumn for local authorities and relevant local\/community groups from areas with sites on the Tentative List.<\/p><p>  The objective of the seminar will be to guide and equip participants, in particular the local authorities, to produce the detailed material needed by my Department to support the preparation and submission of substantive applications to UNESCO for World Heritage inscription.  The seminar will assemble relevant experts, local authorities and other groups and provide a forum where all elements of applying for and retaining World Heritage status will be explored and explained.<\/p><p>  I expect that, following the Autumn seminar, there will be a substantive basis for advancing one or more sites from the current Tentative List with a view to inscription on the World Heritage list.  Against that background, my immediate priority will be to achieve progress with UNESCO inscriptions from the current Tentative List and it would be premature at this point to speculate as the when the next review of the Tentative List might take place.  However, as I have indicated, drawing up a proposal for inclusion on the Tentative List requires a great deal of research and agreement amongst all stakeholders and it would be very worthwhile for the relevant interests in the areas you have cited to make a start on that process at  local level in anticipation of the next review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800075#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":3182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800075#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3183,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[36491\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800075#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of archaeologists employed by his Department on a remunerated basis and under the JobBridge scheme, if applicable; and his plans to employ additional archaeologists this year or in 2014.

The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing with the private sector to deliver high speed services to areas which are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market alone.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.

Following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the Commission carried out an analysis of the legislative and regulatory situation in the European Union, and suggested a course of action, including revision of existing legislation, as well as future new proposals, strengthening EU intervention capacity, and action at regional and global levels.   Following detailed negotiations among Member States, facilitated by both the Cyprus and Irish Presidencies of the European Union, agreement was reached in March of this year during the Irish Presidency, on a proposal on safety of offshore oil and gas prospection, exploration and production activities.<\/p><p>  The Offshore Safety Directive provides for a new area of competence for the EU in the respect of the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities addressing their potential to give rise to both safety and major environmental hazards.  The Directive introduces a number of very important and complex provisions for improving safety for offshore gas and oil drilling which include, in the first instance, reaching agreement on a text relating to the establishment of the Competent Authority in each Member State.  The position agreed recognises both the difference in activity levels among Member States and the potential additional burden on them, which the new Directive could give rise to. While the agreement achieved acknowledges the need to have regard to such factors, it does so without diluting the need for safety at all times.<\/p><p>  The issue of liability regimes is also addressed, and it was the view of the Council that it could not come to a pre-judgment on such a crucial issue pending the outcome of EU Commission studies, which are due to report next year.  Another matter of considerable significance is the inclusion of provisions with regard to public participation, ensuring that either Strategic Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Assessment would be undertaken with respect to all relevant offshore activities prior to their approval and commencement.  Other noteworthy issues that are included are confidential reporting, response effectiveness, activities in the Arctic, the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency, activities outside the EU and criminalising conduct leading to a major accident.<\/p><p>  The agreement reached will ensure a consistent use of best practices for major hazards control by oil and gas industry offshore operations potentially affecting Union waters or shores, implement best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities, strengthen the Union&rsquo;s preparedness and response capacity to deal with emergencies potentially affecting EU citizens or the environment, and improve and clarify existing liability and compensation provisions. <\/p><p>  Ultimately the goal of the safety regulation of offshore exploration activity is to improve safety in extremely challenging environments.  There will be significant safety measures arising from this Directive that will benefit our global environment.<\/p><p>It is a requirement of the Directive that it be transposed into, national legislation within 2 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800075#WRFF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":3214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3215,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[36200\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 447 of 28 May 2013, if he will provide details of the public tender process referred to in the reply, with details of the manner of advertising of this process; the time limits that applied; the number of enquires received; the number of tenders received; and if he will provide details of the principals involved in the successful tender and the legal status and address of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":3216,"content":"<p>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 290 on 18 June 2013, matters in relation to the sale of premises are a day to day operational matter for the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) subject to Public Financial Procedures.<\/p><p>  Details as regards public tendering and the transaction referred to by the Deputy are included on files held by the Board and not the Department.<\/p><p>In this regard, I have asked IFI to expedite contact with the Deputy to address her queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy Review","counter":3217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3218,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[36229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will detail Ireland's contributions to the European Council discussion on the Commission's communication, entitled \"Making the internal energy market Work\"; if Ireland's concerns were incorporated into the communique; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

On 15<sup>th<\/sup> February 2013 I again invited further expressions of interest from persons wishing to serve on any of the Boards under the aegis of my Department.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this significant innovation, the level of expressions of interest from women has been less than half that of men. Of the 31 applications made in 2011 on foot of the invitation to submit expressions of interest, 10 were from women and 21 from men.  In 2012 the total number of applicants was 37 of which 8 were from women and 29 from men. Of the 92 applications made to date in 2013, on foot of the invitation to submit expressions of interest, 27 are from women and 65 from men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":3242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Implementation","counter":3241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":3242,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[36129\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the way he expects landlords to co-operate with the proposed housing assistance payment scheme; if he anticipates that some persons may be made homeless due to non-co-operation by landlords; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department and the Department of Social Protection have been working closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in this project.<\/p><p>  Work has also been on-going with the County and City Managers Association (CCMA), through the Project Steering Group, in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP. In June a Project Implementation Team was initiated, which will be responsible for detailed planning and implementation during the testing and roll-out phases. A detailed business process design for HAP is currently underway which involves input from all the relevant key stakeholders. Following the completion of the business process design the implementation team will, in conjunction with my Department, develop a plan for the test phase in a number of local authorities.<\/p><p>  In respect of the staff resources, the CCMA, through its involvement in both the Project Steering Group and the Project Implementation Team, is providing on-going advice in relation to the resources that will be required by local authorities to implement HAP. This input will continue as the detail of the scheme is developed further this year.<\/p><p>  One of the specific objectives of HAP is to facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector which it is intended would lead to improved standards of accommodation, improved levels of registration with the PRTB and strengthened processes for ensuring tax compliance by landlords. Landlords will be expected to comply with the terms of the Scheme in these regards. While I do not anticipate an issue with tenants being able to secure appropriate accommodation in the private rented sector under HAP, I will be keeping this matter under review in the pilot phase of HAP implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maritime Vessel Recycling","counter":3246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3247,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[36178\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the agreement on ship recycling regulation during the Irish EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3248,"content":"<p>The agreement reached between the Presidency and European Parliament on the Ship Recycling Regulation concluded six months of intensive negotiations under the Irish EU Presidency. Over 1,000 ships a year are recycled worldwide. Contrary to most other waste streams, ships generally have a significant financial value at end-of-life. Steel is the main material extracted in the recycling process but older ships, in particular, also contain many hazardous substances including asbestos and heavy metals. Much of the recycling is carried out in facilities that lack sufficient safety measures or environmental protection for workers, which leads to high accident rates and extensive pollution.<\/p><p>  It is intended that the new Regulation will provide a much-needed stimulus to raise standards for recycling all ships, in the interim period before the entry into force of the 2009 Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The Regulation covers the whole life-cycle of EU-flagged ships and transposes for the EU the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention. The Regulation is the first legislative instrument adopted at regional level in respect of this significant waste stream containing hazardous substances.<\/p><p>The new EU ship recycling regime comprises the following main elements:<\/p><p> - EU ship owners will be required to only recycle ships at facilities on the EU approved list, either in the EU or in third countries;<\/p><p> - in order to be on the EU approved list, ship recycling facilities must comply with the minimum requirements of the regulation as to worker health and safety procedures and environmental protection;<\/p><p>- ship recycling facilities must be approved by national authorities in the case of EU facilities and by independent verifiers with appropriate qualifications in the case of non-EU facilities. Such non-EU facilities must remain open to inspection by EU inspectors in order to verify their ongoing compliance with the requirements of the regulation;<\/p><p>- ships will be required to maintain an inventory of hazardous materials on board at all times;<\/p><p>- ships entering EU ports are to   be open to inspections by port state control authorities to verify the maintenance of the inventory;<\/p><p>- EU ships will be subject to surveys at 5-yearly intervals after being put in service;<\/p><p>- owners of EU ships will be required to engage an approved ship recycling facility to prepare a &ldquo;ship recycling plan&rdquo; prior to \trecycling, such plan to include how hazardous materials in the ship structure are to be managed and which shall be submitted to the flag state administration;<\/p><p>- flag state administrations will issue a &ldquo;ready for recycling&rdquo; certificate before authorising the recycling of EU ships, having - (i) verified that the hazardous materials inventory has been properly maintained, (ii) approved the ship recycling plan, and (iii) verified that the ship recycling facility where the ship is to be recycled is included in the EU approved list; and<\/p><p>- the ship re cycling facility must confirm the completion of the recycling of the ship to the EU flag state administration.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the new regulation will be effective and make a positive contribution to the proper recycling of EU ships which can be followed globally. I also hope that this new EU regulation will act as an important stimulus to facilitate the early ratification of the Hong Kong Convention on Ship Recycling which was adopted in 2009 and that, on foot of this EU initiative, other global regions will follow the EU lead in respect of this important waste stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Yield","counter":3249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3250,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[36642\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800076#WRGG03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the revenue that would be raised from retaining the non-principal private residence tax and increasing it to &euro;300; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, contain national eligibility criteria which must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household's eligibility for social housing support. The Regulations provide for certain information to be gathered in respect of households which are determined to have a need, including the number, gender and ages of persons in the household.\u00a0In this regard I am confident that when I directed all housing authorities to prepare a summary of social housing assessments carried out in their areas on 7 May 2013, the results to be published later this year will give an accurate reflection of the level and type of need at both local authority and national level.   <\/p><p>  In terms of addressing that need, Government policy is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support requirements through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014. Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure the identification of suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going. <\/p><p>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year or in subsequent years. However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800078#WRJJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Administration","counter":3333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3334,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[36595\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of Leader projects of more than &euro;150,000 that are awaiting ministerial approval; the date each project was submitted; the total value of the projects involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3335,"content":"<p>My Department currently has 42 projects at various stages in the assessment process   .

Two main issues have impacted on the revised allocations recently notified to Local Development Companies (LDCs). <\/p><p>  The first relates to overall Programme performance. During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of LDCs, who were contracted to deliver the Programme, were not committing funds at the level required to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline. Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available. <\/p><p>  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &lsquo;first-come first served&rsquo; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed. All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them. All LDCs had an equal opportunity to maximise funding in their respective areas, and some companies availed of this more than others. <\/p><p>  The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates. During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013. This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. <\/p><p>  In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs, taking into account the level of commitments already entered into. <\/p><p>  Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million the total spend to date and outstanding contractual commitments under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370 million. &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs. Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment. The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding. Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation, an adjustment was made to bring the revised allocation up to 80% of the original. <\/p><p>  In the case of Cavan Monaghan LEADER the revised allocation represents a decrease of 17.5% from their original allocation. The redistribution of available funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible with many LDCs experiencing similar reductions. <\/p><p>  I am committed to the continued monitoring of this situation and my Department will conduct another formal review of commitments and expenditure levels at the end of August 2013. If LDCs are not performing with regard to the Programme commitment levels, allocations will again be revised in the context of maximizing commitments to the end of the Programme by December 2013.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Projects","counter":3360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3361,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[36772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if a report on the investigation by the Ombudsman carried out in respect of a community project (details supplied) in County Meath has been communicated to his Department; if the Ombudsman has recommended to the Department the funding that should be paid in respect of the community project in question; if he will advise if his Department has taken any action on foot of the investigation by the Ombudsman; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3362,"content":"<p>In line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach to rural development under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, there are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf to deliver the Programme throughout the country.

Since its introduction, the programme of land registration in Ireland has been both extensive and very successful and almost 2.8 million land parcels, representing approximately 95% of all property in the country, are now registered in the Land Registry of the Property Registration Authority.<\/p><p>  When title or ownership is registered in the Land Registry, the legal ownership is entered on folios which form the registers maintained in the Land Registry. In conjunction with folios, the Land Registry also maintains Land Registry maps. Where title is registered in the Land Registry it is referred to as &quot;registered property&quot; and is open to public inspection. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011. As part of the implementation of the Reform Plan, the Government announced on 31 October 2012 that it would proceed with the merger of the Property Registration Authority with the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland. Work is underway to advance the implementation of the merger under the supervision of a Project Board comprised of senior officials from the three Government Departments concerned and the Chief Executive Officers of the three Agencies. Among the issues to be examined in the context of the merger are the strategic goals and priorities of the prospective merged organisation. It is anticipated that it will be possible to derive significant added value from the bringing together of the rich data holdings of the three organisations concerned. It is possible that the development of a cadastre system for Ireland may be considered in that context. I should note that full implementation of the merger will require significant legislative change in due course, and that any move to a cadastre system could potentially have very significant implications in relation to land and property law in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800079#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":3370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3371,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[36063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures he is taking to preserve privacy online and protection of citizens' data in the wake of\u00a0significant breaches of internet privacy being committed by the American National Security Agency and the British GCsa; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3372,"content":"<p> As I have indicated to the House previously, I, of course, fully understand the concerns which have arisen in the wake of recent media reports about the PRISM programme.  I am aware too of reports which have appeared about the alleged activities of other security agencies.  I raised the concerns which had been expressed about the PRISM programme with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at my recent meetings with him in Dublin.  At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime.<\/p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  I will continue to make the point at international level that in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I have emphasised the importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and appropriate.<\/p><p>  It was agreed that data protection and security experts from the US and from the EU would meet to clarify remaining matters as necessary.

In turn, that framework is subject to judicial oversight.  More generally, I can tell the Deputy that substantial progress was made during the Irish Presidency  advancing key aspects of the EU's data protection reform package.  A further indicator of our commitment in this area is the significant increases which have taken place in the resources made available to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, notwithstanding the current difficult economic circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":3373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3374,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[36223\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on the establishment of an internal security fund during the Irish EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3375,"content":"<p>The Internal Security Fund is one of two funding programmes (the other being the Asylum and Migration Fund) proposed for the Home Affairs area under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2014 to 2020.

I am advised that in 2013, some &euro;19 million has been allocated to fund MABS and that sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to two years, to establish an Approved Intermediary service. In addition to this dedicated services there will  also be additional Approved Intermediaries, when authorised, located in MABS offices throughout the country. These Approved Intermediaries will not charge any fee for arranging a Debt Relief Notice. In accordance with the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, Approved Intermediaries can only process Debt Relief Notices and do not have any role in relation to Debt Settlement Arrangements or Personal Insolvency Arrangements.<\/p><p>  With regard to Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) there are two separate sets of fees. The ISI fee for applying for a Protective Certificate for a DSA or a PIA and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) fee.  The fee payable to the ISI in relation to the issue of a Protective Certificate for a DSA will be &euro;250 and &euro;500 for a PIA. Insofar as Practitioner fees associated with the development of DSAs and PIAs are concerned, these fees will be negotiated with an individual debtor by the PIP in advance of a case proceeding and will be deducted from the amount of money an individual debtor is calculated as having available to pay their creditors during the term of the arrangement. These arrangements could last for up to 7 years. As such this fee should have a relatively minor impact on the debtor themselves. In fact some prospective Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs) have indicated that, if and when authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to practice, they will not charge upfront fees for initial consultations with insolvent debtors. Furthermore, the Regulations relating to PIPs require them to clearly specify their level of charges and associated costs before being appointed by the debtor to develop an arrangement for a PIA or DSA.   Based on experience in other jurisdictions, I am advised by the ISI that there have been indications that the issue of fees rarely arises. It is anticipated that debtors will be able to afford the application fees. It should also be noted that the reasonable living expenses guidelines published under Section 23 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 make allowances for savings and contingencies in addition to social inclusion money. It will therefore be possible for debtors to build up  the money required for the ISI fee over a relatively short period of time.  In cases where an insolvency arrangement is not possible, it will be open to the individual debtor to petition for bankruptcy, the term of which is being reduced from 12 years to 3 years under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":3382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":3383,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[36285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of drivers detected for speeding on the N3 in County Dublin and County Meath in the years 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013; the number of drivers who have paid such fines to date; the number of drivers who have yet to pay a fine; and the number of who were subject to legal action for non-payment of a fine for speeding in these areas.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3384,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

The Deputy might wish to note that it is a generally accepted principle internationally, and one which Ireland applies, that a person should seek asylum in the first safe host country in which they arrive.

It would not be a matter for me as Minister to comment on any case a person might make to the courts in relation to an extradition application.

As is well known, in December of that year the Government took the difficult decision not to proceed with that commitment.  It will be recalled that the background to this decision was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.   As I have indicated in my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision which was taken in 2011 not to proceed with legislation in relation to this matter.<\/p><p>  On a related issue, it is widely acknowledged that one of the difficulties in regard to rent reviews is the absence of readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.

While there have been some delays in establishing this Database work is at a very advanced stage to ensure that it will be operational shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":3402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL02450"},{"type":"question","counter":3403,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[35985\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for further recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3404,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[35999\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are any plans to reopen recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3405,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[36234\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800080#WRLL02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to commence Garda recruitment again; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3406,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502, 505 and 521 together.<\/p><p>  I do believe that it is important for an organisation such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have some regular intakes of new recruits, even if on a modest scale.

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 14 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.    All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.   The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are now 1 Superintendent, 3 Sergeants and approximately 127 whole time equivalent civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit. With further assignments of staff this month, staffing at the Unit will be of the order of 140 (whole time equivalent) staff, which represents an increase in staff assigned to the Unit of almost 50% since March this year. As staff become fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  My Department is also examining the scope for the redeployment of additional personnel from within the public service to the Unit.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800081#WRMM00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3415,"content":"<p>Question No. 505 answered with Question No. 502.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law Review","counter":3416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800081#WRMM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":3417,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[36000\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800081#WRMM00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"following the publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence of a report on its review of the legislation on prostitution here, if he will be bringing forward legislation on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":3418,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[36248\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800081#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the recent report by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice which recommends the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual service; if he plans to take any action in relation to the report's recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3419,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 506 and 535 together.<\/p><p>  The report referred to by the Deputies was published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on 27 June and I have not yet had the opportunity to fully consider its contents.

It is expected that formal adoption of the Regulation will take place in time for the system to come into effect by the end of the year.  The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders. In particular, EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for member states' authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information and to cooperate with each other and with the FRONTEX Agency in order to reduce the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and to increase internal security by preventing cross-border crime, such as trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs. It will also contribute to the protecting and saving the lives of migrants; particularly those at risk on the high seas where tragically lives have been lost of persons in small or makeshift craft seeking to reach European shores.<\/p><p>  The regulation will apply to the surveillance of land and sea external borders of the member states in the Schengen Area. It may also be applied to the surveillance of air borders as well as to checks at border crossing points if the member states voluntarily provide such information to EUROSUR. It is envisaged that the application of the EUROSUR regulation to the member states located at the southern and eastern external borders will start from December 2013 and to the remaining participating member states from December 2014.<\/p><p>  The Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part in the border provisions, in accordance with Council Decision 2002\/192\/EC of 28 February 2002. Ireland is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. The United Kingdom are in a similar position. However, the Regulation provides for the possibility of close cooperation and exchanges of information with Ireland and the United Kingdom on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom and one or several neighbouring Member States or through regional networks based on these agreements<b><\/b>which may assist in better achieving the objectives of EUROSUR.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, separately, with the objective of protecting the integrity of the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangement, Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on a range of measures aimed at securing the external borders of the CTA. The nature of this cooperation is much the same as that envisaged under the EUROSUR arrangement and involves daily operational cooperation between the immigration authorities of both countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800082#WRNN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schengen Agreement","counter":3455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800082#WRNN00650"},{"type":"question","counter":3456,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[36224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800082#WRNN00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if Ireland will have access to the exchange of information between police and border authorities now that the Schengen information system has been achieved during the Irish EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The second generation of this system was brought into operation in April 2013.<\/p><p>  Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen Agreement, including police cooperation.  Our application to participate in the specified articles of the Agreement was approved by a Council Decision and, in accordance with this Decision, the provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council.  Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This is because the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the UK did not.

At that time I explained that the independent Selection Panel, which was established to carry out this task, had confirmed to me that it had not proved possible to recruit a Chief Commissioner at that time.  The Selection Panel  suggested that the full-time nature of the position and the length of the contract (5 years) may have been issues that mitigated against the successful recruitment of a Chief Commissioner.  The position was designated as a full-time one as the Paris Principles, which govern the establishment of such bodies, contain a preference for a full-time Commissioners.  When the Chief Commissioner position was advertised it included a requirement that the person to be appointed should not have served on either the Equality Authority or the Human Rights Commission.  This requirement is considered essential to ensure that the Chief Commissioner will bring balance and neutrality to the position in a sensitive merger context and will remain as a requirement when the position is re-advertised.<\/p><p>  In the light of the experience gained in the recruitment process to date, I consider as already announced that future selection of persons to serve as members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission should be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The PAS has existed in its different forms since the foundation of the State, to ensure integrity and impartiality in the appointment of civil servants and other public servants and is independent in the discharge of its functions and would thus fully meet the Paris Principles&rsquo; requirement for a selection process independent of Government.<\/p><p>  This is a change in the selection process as originally adopted in the General Scheme of the Bill, which I consider is now required in the light of experience.  I note that use of the PAS was one of the other options considered by the Working Group set up to advise me on practical arrangements for establishment of IHREC in its report.  My Department is in consultation with the Public Appointment Service in relation to the detailed arrangements in that regard and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement shortly.

","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3497,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.<\/p><p>  I assume the question refers to a recently published article by the Ombudsman on asylum seekers.  The Ombudsman says in her article that her examination of a specific case, involving the HSE and the Department of Social Protection around the issue of a social welfare entitlement to a family which had been in Direct Provision, led her to comment on the asylum accommodation system more generally.  It should be noted that the Ombudsman Act, 1980 does not provide for the investigation by the Ombudsman of any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum. Notwithstanding that, I should add that INIS has administrative arrangements in place with the Office of the Ombudsman to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman is, of course, perfectly entitled to the personal opinions expressed in the article but I do not share many of them.  In particular, I do not accept the attempted correlation between the residents of direct provision accommodation centres and past residents of industrial schools or Magdalene laundries.  It is to be expected that asylum seekers, if given a choice in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, would prefer to have independent accommodation, a right to welfare and work and so on, instead of being restricted to the system of direct provision to meet their needs.  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, it should be noted that all EU Member States operate systems for dealing with asylum seekers which in one form or another greatly restrict their access to welfare, work or independent housing.  In reality, the system in this State is at least on a par and often significantly better than that in operation in many other Member States. In the circumstances, it is grossly misleading to characterise our treatment of asylum seekers as being akin to that meted out to subjects of abuse who had no protection of the law or relevant State bodies.<\/p><p>   I have recounted in responses to many D&aacute;&iacute;l Questions how the rights of residents of accommodation centres are protected both within the Direct Provision system and, of course, by the laws of our country. The Ombudsman's article, rightly, places great emphasis on the rights of children in the Direct Provision system. Again, I have explained before how children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through the Reception and Integration Agency's (RIA) Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated Child and Family Services unit in RIA.  Children in Direct Provision centres, of course, enjoy the same educational and health entitlements as Irish citizen children.  Sight must not be lost of the fact that applicants for refugee status, who otherwise would have no permission to be in the State, have their protection claims dealt with in accordance with a prescribed legal framework and exclusively on their merits having regard to their subjective and objective elements.  They have full recourse to the judicial review process in the courts and to the general protection of the State.<\/p><p>  I accept that the direct provision system is not ideal and many residents spend too long there. But it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the heads of those seeking protection or the right to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds or other reasons.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  It is acknowledged that the Direct Provision system provides value for money. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  In her article, the Ombudsman does not say that the direct provision system is in breach of international conventions. Rather, she references a number of reports critical of the direct provision system which argue that it is.  She acknowledges that, ultimately, such judgements are matters for a court.  Over the years, the direct provision system has been open to scrutiny by many international bodies. Centres have been visited by various UN bodies, including the UNHCR, and by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner.  I appeared before the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in connection with its scrutiny of Ireland under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process In October, 2011. No recommendation was made in relation to the Direct Provision system in the Committee's subsequent UPR report on Ireland.<\/p><p>  There is no question but that the asylum system is slow, fragmented and is in need of reform and I am determined to see this reform through.  For me, the length of time spent in the Direct Provision system, rather than the quality of provision within the system itself, is the real issue and I am committed to remedying that. Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems&quot;, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way.<\/p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU\/IMF\/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  In relation the accommodation centre in Millstreet, Co. Cork, issues inevitably arise in a system as complex and diverse as the Direct Provision system and it is important that they are dealt with quickly.  I am advised by RIA that there are ongoing discussions between residents and management. Senior officials in RIA have already visited the centre and will do so again today to provide any assistance required to achieve a resolution acceptable to all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3498,"content":"<p>Question No. 535 answered with Question No. 506.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3499,"content":"<p>Question No. 536 answered with Question No. 528.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":3500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO01150"},{"type":"question","counter":3501,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[36250\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his Department will be introducing further reforms in the domestic violence legal framework; the level of funding provided to Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence in 2013 and 2014.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3502,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims.

Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable.<\/p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders.  General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society.  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences. Arising from the review, l expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Support Services","counter":3506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":3507,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[36252\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in the direct provision system; the total cost to the Exchequer of the current system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3508,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection is being processed.

Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated \"whole-of-government\" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women and men. Cosc carries out its co-ordination functions primarily within the framework of the first National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The strategy was published in March 2010 and covers the period 2010 to 2014.<\/p><p>  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is achieved through a six monthly exercise to establish progress to date on the activities in the Strategy. Cosc undertakes the regular monitoring. The process is overseen by the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Men and a high-level group of officials known as the Strategy Oversight Committee. Each six monthly monitoring exercise is published on the Cosc website.  In addition, a mid-term review of the implementation of the strategy was completed in 2012 and published on the Cosc website following consideration by the National Steering Committees and the Oversight Committee.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex plan involving four objectives and 59 activities. The mid-term review of the National Strategy noted, in broad terms, that good progress had been made in relation to around a quarter of the planned activities, that a further fifty per cent of the activities were making progress with some delays and that approximately a fifth of the planned activities had limited or poor progress. The review resulted in a re-prioritisation of many of the actions of the strategy and an update of the time-frames for delivery of the actions.  An updated  table of the actions with the priority and time-frame associated has been published on the Cosc website.<\/p><p>  In terms of domestic abuse against children, I assume that the Deputy is referring to statistics recently published by Women's Aid in its annual report for 2012. There are a number of possible reasons for this increase. It is not, for instance, clear whether this represents a greater willingness of people who ring the Women's Aid helpline to discuss the emotional and other impacts of domestic abuse on their children, improved recording of this aspect of domestic abuse by the helpline, or an actual increase in the targeting of children in domestic situations. As one of the strategy's key aims  is to increase awareness among the general public of the incidence of domestic violence and among victims of the services available to them, increases in reporting are to be expected and indeed welcomed. There has been an increase in public debate and a range of policy initiatives in relation to children experiencing abuse, violence, neglect and bullying, which may lead to a greater willingness to discuss the impact of domestic violence on children.<\/p><p>  I would also like to state that front-line community and voluntary domestic violence services for those suffering from domestic violence are funded at present by the Health Service Executive for which the Minister for Health has responsibility.  I understand that responsibility for these services will transfer to the Child and Family Support Agency when established and that agency will come under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800083#WROO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Committals","counter":3516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800084#WRPP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3517,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[36255\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800084#WRPP00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason those convicted of minor offences are often brought to prison and returned from prison on the same day, often by the same Garda&iacute; who delivered them there in the first instance; his views on whether this makes a mockery of our justice system and that it is a waste of Garda&iacute; time and resources; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that on occasion those convicted of penalty points serve as little as two hours' prison sentence; the reason this is occurring; if it is down to a lack of prison places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p>  Given the number of prisoners in custody it is not possible to segregate those who are in prison for the first time from those who have been in custody on more than one occasion. It must be borne in mind that someone&rsquo;s first period of imprisonment does not necessarily indicate a first offence. Efforts are made, where possible to segregate remand prisoners from sentenced prisoners. In addition, prisoners who are vulnerable or have requested the protection of the Governor are segregated from the general prison population. Every effort is made to ensure that those prisoners who cannot associate freely with the general prison population have the greatest possible access to services.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800084#WRPP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community Issues","counter":3534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800084#WRPP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3535,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[36297\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800084#WRPP01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures he will take to ensure Travellers and Roma are directly involved in the development of Ireland's national Traveller Roma Integration Strategy.

Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State. <\/p><p>  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 16 July 2013, there were 1,280 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  I am further informed that, as a matter of Garda operational and data policy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not provide a break down of persons subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 on a county by county or Divisional basis.   All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his\/her Division to assist him\/her in carrying out his\/her duties.  Where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken, including circulation through PULSE of their information, as well as inquiries to identify their current whereabouts.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.  <\/p><p>  I can further advise the Deputy that sex offenders released from prison, who are subject to supervision by the Probation Service under a Post Release Supervision Order, are assessed while in custody by the Probation Service using a validated risk assessment instrument. The risk and needs identified in the assessment inform the development of the case management plan, which is then monitored and supervised by the Probation Service in the community.  I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified as a priority.<\/p><p>  I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish and British Governments on the sharing of information on sex offenders between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces, including the PSNI, is in place since 2006 and there are excellent working relationships surrounding the monitoring of the travel arrangements of the persons in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Magdalen Laundries Issues","counter":3573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3574,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[36457\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form by county and demographic, the numbers of applications received so far under the Magdalene Redress scheme; if he will provide an update on the status of the recommendations produced by Justice Quirke; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy,  I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.   <\/p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced. I am informed that no decision on an individual venue is taken without prior consultation with local stakeholders. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter. <\/p><p>  I am informed that a total of 16 venues have been closed since March 2011, in the following locations: Enniscorthy,  Athenry, Ballymote, Borrisokane, Boyle, Castlecomer, Castleisland, Castletownbere, Claremorris, Ennistymon, Kiltimagh, New Ross, Portarlington, Roscrea, Shannon, and Templemore.  With the exception of Enniscorthy which was closed on 1 May 2011, the venues listed above were closed on 1 January 2012. The Service has indicated that Ballyconnell, and An Spid&eacute;al  will close on 1 September 2013.<\/p><p>  At its meeting on 1 July 2013, the Courts Service Board approved the closure of venues at Ballyhaunis, Baltinglass, Birr, Clones, Edenderry, Kells, Kinsale, Swinford, I am advised that a date for the closures has not been determined but it is likely that they will close on or before 1 January 2014. , Also at that meeting, the Board decided to defer the decision regarding the future of Skibbereen until the autumn.<\/p><p>  The Service has stated that many of the smaller courthouses around the country have remained in the ownership of the local authorities. In the case of the closure of such a court venue, the building is available to the local authority for alternative use. In the case of the closure of a courthouse building which has been vested in the Courts Service, the Service will consider requests for the transfer of ownership of such buildings to other public bodies. The Service liaises with local authorities and the Office of Public Works about potential alternative uses. In recent years, four courthouses have been transferred to local authorities for use as community facilities, including as an arts centre and a youth cafe.  The Courts Service is currently reviewing its policy on the disposal of property.  There are five courthouse buildings in Courts Service ownership that are not used as court venues. Of those, one  will shortly be transferred to the Office of Public Works and another is in use for storage. In 2012, the total costs associated with the five buildings was &euro;27,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":3585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":3586,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[36589\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800085#WRQQ02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the frequency of the various orders available to the Courts under the terms of the operation of the Children Act, with breakdown of same.

It represented a major logistical and diplomatic challenge for Ireland which, with the European Commission, acted as lead negotiator and spokesperson for the European Union in the multiple contact groups.<\/p><p>  The two week session addressed a range of important issues relating to forests and economic development including means of implementation for sustainable forest management (SFM) and a number of important emerging issues.  Long and difficult negotiations were a feature of this session as delegates aimed to reflect the core issues of most importance to them in the overall conclusions.  The importance of forests for economic development and on their overall contribution to the green economy was central.  This will facilitate a further rollout of SFM at global level.  This can only benefit all countries, both in the developed and developing worlds. <\/p><p>A multi-stakeholder dialogue and a high level Ministerial segment took place during the first week of the session.  The overall result of the two week session was deemed to be a success by participants and agreement on two action-oriented Draft Resolutions was delivered.  Resolution 1 addresses the implementation of the non-legally binding instrument on forests, regional inputs, economic development and enhanced global cooperation.  The second resolution dealt with agreement on emerging issues, means of implementation and the UNFF Trust Fund.  These will, in due course, go before the UN Economic and Social Council for further action. <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency was particularly challenging in the Forestry arena with many major international events taking place.  In the case of the Istanbul event, it involved months of preparation that entailed developing and coordinating very detailed position papers which successfully captured the European position.  I can justifiably express a feeling of satisfaction with our Presidency&rsquo;s achievements in this complex area. Ireland has left a very sound platform for our EU and other colleagues to work from in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Pension Provisions","counter":3726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU01750"},{"type":"question","counter":3727,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[36365\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in respect of each State agency and commercial State company under the aegis of his Department, if he will provide details of the name of each pension scheme; details of the salary percentage contributions made by the employer and the employees; the latest information on the funding position of the scheme; if any changes are planned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3728,"content":"<p>The details of the pension scheme used by the State agencies and commercial State companies under the aegis of my Department are an operational matter for the bodies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":3729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU01950"},{"type":"question","counter":3730,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[36380\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800089#WRUU02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of miles claimed for and the amount of travel expenses paid to him and each Minister of State in his Department in respect of their functions as a Minister in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3731,"content":"<p>The number of kilometres claimed and total travel expenses paid to the Minister of State and I since March 2011, is set out in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Minister \/Minister of State <\/th><th>Number of Kilometres <\/th><th>Travel Expenses<\/th><th>Subsistence Expenses <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>Minister Coveney <\/td><td>41,806<\/td><td>&euro;14,448.84<\/td><td>&euro;2,762.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>Minister of State -

The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the HSE made a decision to gradually reduce the level of funding and support for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts.  I would point to the fact that my Department continues to provide funding to the CCCs which are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  My Department also provides annual funding to the seven National Voluntary Organisations, including Childminding Ireland, to provide support at local level to their members.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.  Work on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is already underway in my Department.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to six years.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.

It is expected that the programme this year will cost up to &euro;175 million when all of the costs are taken into account.

No specific cost analysis has been commissioned in relation to the provision of a second free pre-school year.  However, it is estimated that the additional costs of providing a second year would be similar to the costs incurred in providing the one year free pre-school provision.

The number is currently operational in 23 EU countries and the number has been allocated and is soon to be operational in a further four countries, including Croatia, the newest EU Member State.  In Ireland the 116000 Missing Children Hotline is operated by the ISPCC in liaison with a cross-sectoral Project Team, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Funding for the operation of the line in Ireland is provided by my Department and the EU, through its Daphne funding stream.  My Department provided &euro;50,000 in 2012 and &euro;88,000 in 2013 and the funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from my Department includes; the establishment costs, national promotion and advertisement of the service.  In common with all Exchequer funding, requirements for the operation of the service in future years will be considered in the context of the usual Estimates process.  The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a limited hours pilot basis in Ireland since December 2012 and on a full-time 24\/7 basis since end April, 2013. The service was officially launched on 7 June 2013.<\/p><p>  A key component of the service is a successful awareness programme. It is vital that those who could benefit from the service know that it exists and that users are aware of the scope of the service.  During the initial set-up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The successful launch of the service on 7 June 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the service.  The 116000 Missing Children Hotline website, <i>www.missingchildrenhotline.ie<\/i>, has also been launched to promote the service.  To date, an amount of some &euro;35,000 has been spent on awareness measures.  This amount will be doubled for further awareness measures in the remainder of 2013.  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800091#WRWW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":3775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3776,"qnumday":633,"qnumall":"[36005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total cost to the Health Service Executive incurred paying for legal representation for guardian ad litems for each of the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Funding of &euro;53.498m, which includes &euro;1.75m capital funding, has been made available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work projects and services provided by the voluntary youth work sector. It is estimated that some 400,000 young people participate in the programmes and services which are provided by approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. Since its establishment, my Department has provided funding for the youth sector as follows:  2011: &euro;60.954m which includes &euro;800,000 capital funding and  2012: &euro;58.306m which includes &euro;1.5m capital funding.<\/p><p>  My Department, as with all Government Departments, has been required to achieve significant savings in recent years, with consequent reductions in funding in all  major programmes on account of the economic challenges facing the country at this time. The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for the Youth Affairs budget from 2012 to 2014 inclusive amount to &euro;11.987m. In implementing the savings required,  I and my Department have tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. I have asked youth organisations and projects to consider the scope for reducing administration and overhead costs as far as is possible and to focus the services for those young people who are most vulnerable. <\/p><p>  I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try to identify ways to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.  There are ongoing meetings at official level with youth sector organisations to share information on the challenges facing services and young people.<\/p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this review will inform the future development of youth programmes and services. <\/p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote coordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. <\/p><p>  The breakdown of  funding is not available in the format requested by the Deputy. The Youth Affairs Unit administers funding to some 30 funding bodies including the Education and Training Boards and other agencies.  A breakdown of funding per funding body in recent years is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":3785,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX01200"},{"type":"question","counter":3786,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[36259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the total cost and details of the travel expenses the Health Service Executive incurred paying for travelling expenses for guardian ad litems for each of the past five years;

","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3806,"content":"<p>The Adoption Authority of Ireland is the central authority in Ireland for intercountry adoption. Agencies are accredited by the Adoption Authority to provide mediation services in relation to intercountry adoption to assist prospective adoptive parents with the adoption process in respect of particular countries.  The operation of such bodies is seen as an additional safeguard for countries in the conduct of the adoption process and is considered good practice by the Hague authorities.  Monitoring and oversight of these agencies is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority. <\/p><p>There are currently three agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority for intercountry adoption purposes.  All three were established on a non-profit basis and, although accredited by the Adoption Authority, they are not public bodies. The financial model underpinning the operation of these agencies was based upon the recoupment of costs from prospective adoptive parents at the different stages of the process.   However, due to trends in adoption world wide, the numbers of adoptions upon which the plans and financial projections of these agencies were developed have not materialised. International developments have also seen an increase in the time taken to complete an adoption.  These trends and developments have raised questions for the sustainability of these agencies in their current format.  <font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/p><p>I have met with these agencies and discussed the situation.  My interest, which is shared by the agencies, is to achieve a solution which responds to the current situation but also assists in introducing the changes required to resolve the underlying issues of sustainability.  My Department has now undertaken an examination of the policy considerations relating to agencies accredited for mediation purposes and the operational and financial situation of the three agencies.  Government has considered the conclusions of this examination.  An important conclusion reached is that there is a strong public policy rationale for public funding contributing towards core organisation costs of mediation services as part of a mixed system of funding.  This mixed funding would also entail the recoupment of specific costs from prospective adoptive parents reflecting the level of service provision related to individual cases.  A commitment in principle to public funding is an important development since up to now the provision of funding has been once-off and temporary in nature.  Such a commitment recognises the additional safeguards which such accredited agencies provide in the conduct of the adoption process.  It also recognises that increasingly countries of origin require that adoptions are mediated through accredited bodies.<\/p><p>However, public funding also demands that organisational arrangements provide value for money and avoid unnecessary duplication.  Therefore, Government has also agreed that significant cost efficiencies on the current three agency model are required.  The decline in the numbers of children eligible for adoption and the responsibility to ensure effective use of public funding for core organisational costs mean significant revision to current arrangements will need to be introduced in the coming months to reduce duplication or unnecessary expenditure.<\/p><p>In the context of the need for reforms to be introduced in this area I have sought and received Government approval to provide transitional funding to the end of 2013 to the three existing agencies, in advance of the development and implementation of revised arrangements next year which will provide a more sustainable model for the future. Provision of this funding is based upon the positive participation of the agencies in developing the revised arrangements.  <\/p><p>I am very happy to advise that the agencies have willingly given commitments to actively engage in developing revised arrangements and my Department, the Adoption Authority and the HSE are working closely with the agencies on a revised model with the objective of introducing new arrangements from 2014.  Enhanced cooperation between the three agencies is also to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>Further detailed work and significant change will be required. An important consideration will be continuity of service provision especially in relation to access to particular countries of choice for prospective adoptive parents. I am pleased with the progress made to date in successfully addressing the immediate financial challenges faced by the agencies and look forward to the continued co-operation of the Adoption Authority and the AAI and accredited agencies with the efforts of my Department in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Pension Provisions","counter":3807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3808,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[36367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800092#WRXX03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"in respect of each State agency and commercial State company under the aegis of her Department, if she will provide details of the name of each pension scheme; details of the salary percentage contributions made by the employer and the employees; the latest information on the funding position of the scheme; if any changes are planned","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3809,"content":"<p>I would like to inform the Deputy there are four agencies which are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote.

The areas I have identified are:<\/p><p>-  Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5<\/p><p>-  Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum <\/p><p>-  Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards<\/p><p>-  Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services <\/p><p>-  Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/p><p>-  Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible<\/p><p>-  Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/p><p>-  Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance<\/p><p>  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.<\/p><p>  The  ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare\/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare\/early education field.  <\/p><p>  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. <\/p><p>  While I recognise the valuable experience which many childcare staff may have accrued, it is now essential that all staff have qualifications on a formal recognised basis.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  <\/p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   <\/p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.

This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.<\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800093#WRYY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Numbers","counter":3830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800093#WRYY01500"},{"type":"question","counter":3831,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[36652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800093#WRYY01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of social workers currently employed by her Department; and if this figure is in line with previous commitments ","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3832,"content":"<p>Figures supplied by the HSE, from its census of employment in the public health and social care sector, indicate that the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the HSE Children and Families service area was 1,397 at the end of June 2013, which is the latest date for which figures are available.<\/p><p>  The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of re-classification of social workers within the HSE into various care groups, including children and families, as part of the process of establishing the Child and Family Agency.

With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.

This new funding model will mean that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  <\/p><p>  A pilot prospective funding programme has been in place for certain elective orthopaedic work (four DRGs covering primary hip and knee replacements) since July 2011.  Seven hospitals initially participated with a further five hospitals joining from January 2012.  The pilot operates by reducing current budgets by an amount of money that relates to the four DRGs.  This portion of the budget is then &ldquo;earned&rdquo; back based on work carried out in the hospital.  There is no change to any other portion of the hospital budget.  <\/p><p>  The project has been reviewed twice, with the most recent report completed in December 2012.  This report highlighted a number of efficiency related benefits including significantly reduced average lengths of stay, increased numbers of day of surgery admissions, and an increase in the number of discharges at the weekend.  While the level of improvement varied across the different hospitals and the different DRGs, all showed significant improvements in these key determinants of hospital efficiency and productivity.  <\/p><p>  This pilot is the first example of Money Follows the Patient in operation in Irish hospitals and is a useful exercise in highlighting the benefits that can accrue as a result of these types of funding arrangements.  It also provides useful lessons in terms of systems and process requirements as well as the need for stakeholder buy-in ahead of roll-out to the wider hospital system.  It is intended that the orthopaedic project will continue until the end of the year at which time the aim is to commence full phased implementation of MFTP.  <\/p><p>  While it is not possible to specify a percentage increase in efficiency that will result when MFTP is rolled out across all public hospitals, I am confident that its introduction will drive efficiencies in similar areas to those evident in the orthopaedic project.  This will help to deliver a more efficient and productive hospital system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800097#WRDDD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":3971,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800097#WRDDD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3972,"qnumday":699,"qnumall":"[36424\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800097#WRDDD00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the savings realised from the administration of vaccines by pharmacists as opposed to general practitioners; if other potential opportunities for transfer of duties have been explored; the potential savings identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3973,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[36614\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800097#WRDDD00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the savings that would be achieved from transferring responsibility for administration of seasonal flu vaccine to community pharmacists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3974,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 699 and 732 together.<\/p><p>  Regulations were introduced in October 2011 to provide a legal basis for community pharmacists to supply and administer seasonal influenza vaccine.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I have updated the Taoiseach on this matter and we expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800098#WREEE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":4037,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800098#WREEE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":4038,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[36558\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071800098#WREEE02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied)","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4039,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.
