Over the past number of years, as an active representative and a Member of the Oireachtas, I have visited the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital, I have met staff there and I have met senior management on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>What the senior management have told me in stark terms is that the accident and emergency department is physically not fit for purpose.  There are other issues around problems in the department.  There are staffing issues and also the fact the demographic around Beaumont Hospital is of a particularly elderly nature.  It is not only the physical issue of the department, but that is part of the issue.  These are eminent staff who are experts in the field.  They know their hospital well and they care for their patients extremely well.  Anybody who has visited it will attest to the fact that the physical environment of the accident and emergency department is not up to standard and if the senior management team in the hospital is saying that it is not safe and they cannot stand over it, clearly something has to happen.<\/p> <p>We are obviously now in a period where the Exchequer is in a healthier place.  The management of the hospital has put together a plan.  They have a vision of investment in the accident and emergency department that can bring it up to standard and provide a much better service for the local community and the Dublin and wider region.  They have estimated its cost at &euro;45 million.  The previous Government, in the guise of the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and myself, met the senior management.  We were in a position to commit to working with the senior management of Beaumont Hospital to deliver this plan, that the investment would happen, and that the accident and emergency department would be reconfigured and reconstructed to be a much better physical fit for the hospital.  I have been running a local campaign and constituents who want to see this investment happen have been engaging with it.<\/p> <p>Has the Minister for Health and the Department committed to this &euro;45 million plan?  Has the Minister met senior management?  Is it part of the Estimates process?  Is it something that will be delivered in the short to medium term because anybody who has visited the accident and emergency department in Beaumont will realise that the situation there cannot continue?  While I did not see anything in the Estimates process and the budget announcements regarding Beaumont Hospital, I was eager to have this discussion today because, before we head into the winter months, it is important for the staff in Beaumont and for the wider community to know that the Government takes this issue seriously and wants to deliver a better service for that hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#A00800","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for raising this important issue.

This increased demand is being driven in part by demographics and an ageing population profile.  In this context, it is worth noting that the 2016 census identified 8% growth since 2011 in the population of Fingal, which is predominantly served by Beaumont Hospital.  Being cognisant of the current demands on the Beaumont accident and emergency department and projected population growth in that area, the development of a new accident and emergency department at Beaumont has been identified as a commitment of the Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p><p>It is noteworthy that the Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to proceeding to the design and planning stage for a dedicated cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont Hospital for inclusion in the 2017 capital plan review.  The HSE cystic fibrosis clinical programme is currently developing a cystic fibrosis model of care that will be important in ensuring that the unit proposed for Beaumont Hospital will meet the needs of patients and the health service.  It is my understanding that both of these projects are also a priority for Beaumont Hospital and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group, of which it is a part.  As such, Beaumont Hospital is currently in the process of finalising business cases for these new developments.  The business cases will then be reviewed by the HSE's capital and property steering group, which approves projects for inclusion in its multi-annual capital plans in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines.  As part of this process, funding provision will be made available for the planning and design phases of these proposed new developments in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017.<\/p><p>I would also like to mention that as part of the recently published winter initiative for 2016 to 2017, Beaumont Hospital will be provided with the resources to open ten additional beds to increase capacity in order to support its accident and emergency department during the crucial winter period to meet the expected surge in volume.  Furthermore, under this initiative, funding has also been provided to expand community intervention teams, additional home care packages and transitional care beds in north Dublin that will support Beaumont through the winter months.  This measure is part of a much larger package of &euro;40 million of additional funding to the HSE aimed at managing winter pressures on our health system by striking a balance between hospital avoidance measures, supporting patient flow through acute hospitals and increasing the availability of social care services.<\/p><p>I assure the Senator that Beaumont Hospital is very important.  I accept the point that we need capital investment in our accident and emergency services and there is an issue with the ageing population in our local communities.  The physical environment of the accident and emergency department is not up to standard and that is something that will be pushed along over the next couple of weeks as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#A00900","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The community in the Minister of State's constituency was hoping for something a little stronger.

On the business plan, I have discovered in recent days that they needed a more comprehensive business case than what was referred to by the Senator.  That was in order to comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines, as set out in the public spending code.  I also requested my adviser to meet the Secretary General of the Department of Health in order to set out a work plan to accelerate this process and they met the same day as the Beaumont Hospital submission was received by the Department of Health.  This work plan involves the Department of Health, the HSE and Beaumont Hospital prioritising and clarifying the timeframes for the submission, with appraisal of a fund business case for approval of the project team and establishing a design team appointment.<\/p> <p>This work is a priority and as I stated, I raised the matter this morning with the Department of Health at the ministerial and management advisory committee meeting.  I have also contacted the chief executive officer of Beaumont Hospital, outlining the next immediate steps that will be taken, that the project is a major priority and it has our full support.  I have secured the funding for the planning and design phases in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017.  I have also contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, both verbally and in writing, seeking funding priority for this project in 2017.

There is no such thing as free legal aid, and that should be clarified and addressed.  The cost of legal aid for family law matters of domestic violence, guardian access and maintenance is a minimum of &euro;130.  There is no free legal aid for family law matters aside from child care and child abduction.<\/p> <p>Legal aid for such matters must be applied for and can take a number of weeks to be processed, as opposed to with criminal law, where an accused person can request service, have it granted and be appointed with a free legal aid solicitor there and then.  The cost of legal aid in family law started at &euro;30 before increasing to &euro;50.  In September 2013, it was again increased to &euro;130.  This is a significant increase and it was done without consultation with organisations or consideration of people's ability to pay.  The cost of legal aid is prohibitive for women seeking protection in domestic violence cases, and that is crucial.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Justice and Equality has been implementing changes in Acts dealing with domestic violence that are to be commended and welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If the women these changes are supposed to help cannot afford to access legal representation then these changes are rendered useless and will make little or no change to the serious issue of domestic violence in this country.  Where an interim barring order has been granted against an ex-partner a hearing for a barring order must be heard within eight days.  This timeframe does not allow the woman to apply for legal aid, have her application processed, pay her fee by postal order, get her pink certificates sent to her and find a solicitor.  This means the women often has to represent herself in court at a barring order hearing.  That is unacceptable because she is going up against someone who could have abused her, her children are there and she cannot afford the &euro;130.  Legal aid costs can be paid in instalments but this can result in a woman having to make an extra payment of up to &euro;20.  The cost of getting postal orders, stamps etc. amounts to ten weekly payments of &euro;13.  The nearest offices to Carlow are Kilkenny and Portlaoise.  The legal aid boards cannot issue the pink certificates required by solicitors to represent a client until the full payment has been made.  Some solicitors will see clients for an initial consultation but without these pink certificates they cannot be represented in court.  The woman can request a waiver or a reduction but this involves getting a statement of means from a client and providing a letter of support and the process is too long.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen the form required to get free legal aid, one of which I have to hand.  Applying for legal aid is almost like applying for a mortgage or for local authority housing.  It is unfair for the most vulnerable women in our society.  There is a perception that there is free legal aid.  There is no such thing as free legal aid.  Even if a woman applies for the reduction and the waiver, which she rarely gets, it is so long in coming that the person has to either go back home or cannot afford to get it.  She has to go back to the environment she wants to leave.  This is crucial.<\/p><p>The most vulnerable people in our society are children and women.  Will the Minister of State ensure there is free legal aid?  I have recently dealt with many of these cases.  In Carlow we offer free women's aid and on Friday mornings we give out food parcels from supermarkets to these women.  This is an emergency.  Women are entitled to free legal aid.  When they go for it they are told there is a waiting list and they could be waiting for weeks.  That is too long.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#B00400","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste I would like to thank the Senator for raising this very important matter.  The provision of civil legal aid is a long-established practice in Ireland with the original scheme for the provision of civil legal aid having been established in December 1979.  It is a prerequisite to getting legal services from the Legal Aid Board that a person meets the financial eligibility criteria.  If people do meet those criteria, the contribution they pay is based on their income and potentially also on their capital.  The contributions regime has always been premised on the basis that a person pays a one-off contribution for legal advice and a further single contribution for legal aid, representation in court.  The contribution for legal advice is set at a minimum of &euro;30 and a maximum of &euro;150.  This could cover a single consultation if that is all that the client requires or it could cover the negotiation and completion of a separation agreement over many months.  The legal aid contribution can rise to a maximum of &euro;1,755 based on a person&rsquo;s income and can be significantly higher if the person has assets other than the family home.  However, it should be noted that there are some caps on the contributions that are payable.  For most family law cases in the District Court, the contribution will be limited to a sum of &euro;417.  It is also important to note that there are, of course, provisions in place which allow a waiver of the contribution in the event that it would cause undue financial hardship, with clear guidelines provided for the interpretation of financial hardship.  I will bring the points the Senator raised to the senior Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Those include a provision that regard should be had to the immediacy of the requirement for legal aid and to the nature of the case to which the application relates.  For example, if the applicant is seeking a legal aid certificate for the purpose of taking a case on foot of the domestic violence legislation, the guidelines state a sympathetic approach should be taken to an application for a waiver or a reduction in the contribution, particularly if the applicant&rsquo;s sole income is social welfare.  The Senator's point about vulnerable women will have to be forcefully made to the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p> <p>These are the general arrangements in place.  There are also categories of cases where the provision of legal services is free and there are other categories where specific arrangements apply.  For example, persons who have been served with proceedings by Tusla will need to meet the financial eligibility criteria but are not required to pay a contribution.<\/p> <p>Services under the new Abhaile scheme are provided free of charge to eligible persons and asylum seekers are charged a &euro;10 contribution for services in relation to international protection matters.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that the Legal Aid Board is keen to ensure that nobody is deprived of appropriate legal representation in court proceedings.  The board keeps the contributions regime under active review and I anticipate that the new board, which the T&aacute;naiste will appoint shortly, will also take an active interest in making sure that the contributions regime is appropriate and fair.  The T&aacute;naiste also knows that the board is working to ensure that a consistent message about its guidelines on waiving or reducing contributions is given to persons who may have difficulty paying a contribution.  It has recently launched a new website with a view to making more information available online.  Senators will be aware that the Legal Aid Board is also responsible for the provision of the State&rsquo;s family mediation services.  As recently as Monday, the T&aacute;naiste officially opened its first co-located law centre and family mediation office.  The family mediation services it provides are free and the T&aacute;naiste very much hopes that more people will seek to use mediation to address family problems though she of course realises that mediation is not the solution in every case.  While paying a legal aid contribution can be a difficulty, it is important to note that they are one-off payments that most people are unlikely to experience more than once or twice in their lives and as I have indicated, the waiver applies in the most sensitive cases.  I will bring the issues the Senator raises today in these important matters to the T&aacute;naiste. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#C00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Is it to be paid in the first week in March or the last week?  If it is to be paid in the last week of March, it is an additional saving to the Exchequer of &euro;28 million.

The motion called on the HSE to make available sufficient funding to ensure all primary schoolchildren receive a minimum dental service in second and sixth class and, ideally, in fourth class as well.  The motion comes as a result of the problem posed by tooth decay in children.<\/p> <p>Tooth decay is a major oral health problem in most industrialised countries affecting 60% to 90% of all children.  It remains the most common chronic disease in children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 19 years.  Tooth decay is four times more common than asthma among adolescents aged 14 to 17 years.  Cavities, even in children who do not yet have permanent teeth, can have serious and lasting complications such as pain, tooth abscess, tooth loss, broken teeth, chewing problems and serious infection.<\/p> <p>My party colleague, Dr. Claire O'Driscoll, has said that realistically, once children start getting teeth they should be seen annually by a dental professional.  Given that almost one in three young children drink sugary and sweetened drinks every day and that 411 million litres of sugary sweetened drinks were sold in Ireland in 2014, it is clear the need for dental professionals is only going to increase.  According to the chief executive of the Irish Dental Association, Fintan Hourihan, the population of children under the age of 16 years in Ireland has increased by 20% in the past decade to 1.1 million.  However, the number of dentists tasked with looking after these young people has fallen by 20% in recent years due to the recruitment embargo.  The result is that a large number of primary schoolchildren are missing school screening and their dental problems are not being identified in the early stages.  This can have knock-on effects with regard to emergency cases in later life.<\/p> <p>As in the case of so many preventable diseases, these problems are a strain on our embattled health service.  Irregular access to dental care results in higher use of emergency services.  We all know we need to make smarter use of our health service.  We need to use preventative measures.  We need to stop the problems before they really start.  Here is a prime example of where we can do just that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#H00900","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to raise one simple issue relating to the national harbour and ports policy.

There is very expensive due diligence going on in a number of ports with regard to the preparation of this and yet there seems to be no action.

It is really important to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, in here early to explain the issues.  In particular, I want to make reference to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, which has four vacancies on its board.

Many of these loans involve farmers and small businesses which have experienced difficulties during the financial crisis.  No figure was released as to the discount at which the vulture fund bought the loans, and we will probably never know.  Once again, we have no idea how much of a haircut the company received.

He is dead right.  The interurban road network serves most regions of the country well but the north west is not served at all.  There was a plan involving the A5 route with a commitment from both Governments, North and South, to provide funding for the provision of a new 2+1 road network linking Donegal and Derry with Dublin.  Of course, that was shelved in 2011 by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who cut the funding commitment by the previous Government from over &euro;400 million to around &euro;50 million, which was to be used for design purposes.  I am not having a go at the previous Government about this.  I am saying that there seems to be a lack of commitment on both sides of the Border with regard to the A5.  The shift in Northern Ireland appears to be towards the link road from Derry linking Belfast rather than the road going through Northern Ireland linking Donegal to Dublin.  I would really welcome it if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport could come to the House to discuss this issue.<\/p> <p>The NRA is now known as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I suppose it would provide the funding but the difficulty is that the capital funding has not been made available even in the 2017 budget to provide the commitments that are required.  There is a need for political will on both sides of the Border to put this back on the agenda.  I am glad that Senator Feighan raised the matter because it is an important issue.  I would welcome it if the Leader could bring the Minister in here not just to talk about that route but to look at other interurban routes as well and bypasses around major towns.  The Ballybofey-Stranorlar bypass in Macroom in west Cork is an example of a bypass that has not been progressed but is at design stage.

The supply of housing is at rock bottom.  We had a very good debate in the House yesterday.  We must build, supply and ensure that first-time buyers can access credit and get on the property ladder, which they cannot do at the moment.  The Government is committed to facilitating the building of houses and providing first-time buyers with this grant.  Academics disagree as academics will do but the important point is that we have an incentivised market.  We need people to be able to come in and buy second-hand houses, which is why the home renovation scheme is there, but it is important that people are able to access credit.  <\/p> <p>In response to Senator McFadden, I have met with the Government Chief Whip regarding the initiation of legislation.  The Government legislative programme commits to 25 Bills being published this session.  It is important that Bills are initiated in this House because that way, the legislative backlog will not happen.  Part of the difficulty, which some of the commentariat do not understand and do not write about, is that we have pre-legislative scrutiny on lots of legislation.  That was a very positive departure in the last D&aacute;il and Seanad but it means that the process slows down.  It makes for a better parliamentary system.  As somebody who chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in the last Oireachtas, I think pre-legislative scrutiny is very important.  The Senator is right and all of us agree that there needs to be more legislation initiated in this House.  We have asked for that.  <\/p> <p>Senator Freeman raised the very important issue of mental health.  The important point here is that there is an increase in the Government's commitment to mental health.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McEntee, has been very successful in promoting mental health.  An extra &euro;35 million will be allocated to mental health services this year in addition to the &euro;35 million provided last year, which is the base funding for mental health.  We have the commitment to the Central Mental Hospital in terms of the capital plan and the construction of a new forensic mental health service in Portrane.  <\/p> <p>The important point, which we need to put into perspective regarding the delivery of the money, is how the HSE allocates that money in its service plan.  Therein lies the difficulty in the area of health.  Government has allocated &euro;14 billion to the Department of Health, which is the highest ever spend.  It is in excess of what it was when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin ran out of it and when Mary Harney was stuck there because none of you would take it.  It is now &euro;14 billion.  Senator Daly referenced the increase in numbers and wants to see more services provided, something with which we all agree, but that costs money.  How is that money allocated?  The big question we should be asking of the HSE beyond this Chamber is how it apportions and allocates that money.  The Government gives that money, the Department of Health allocates it and the HSE spends it in some cases.  I think that is a matter for the service plan.  <\/p> <p>Senator Gavan again raised the issue of Shannon Airport.

Where I would join with Senator Gavan is with regard to the condemnation of the bombings and the killing of people in Yemen.  There can be no ambiguity in our expression of, not just outrage and solidarity, but also condemnation and the need to see a resolution-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#L00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>We helped to transit those bombs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#L00700","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I do not agree with the Senator about that.<\/p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of CETA.

I am pleased to be in the House to discuss the consequences for Ireland of the result of the EU-UK referendum.<\/p> <p>I will begin by giving some details about the comprehensive series of actions my Department and I have undertaken in response to the UK referendum result.  On the day of the referendum result, I established a co-ordination group on Brexit in my Department consisting of the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, along with relevant enterprise, Single Market and trade officials from the Department.  This group, which I chair, continues to meet regularly and oversees the management of our response to the referendum result.<\/p> <p>I have met with a wide range of representative organisations including IBEC, ICTU, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Exporters Association, the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Irish Farmers Association, to provide an update on immediate responses and to reassure business in the aftermath of the result.<\/p> <p>Last month, I travelled to Brussels, where I had a series of meetings with the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Elbieta Biekowska, the European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, and Vicky Ford MEP, Chair of the Internal Market Committee of the European Parliament.  I used these meetings to convey the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland at the earliest stage, in advance of the commencement of the detailed exit negotiations.<\/p> <p>On 2 November, I will have meetings in London with my two recently appointed UK counterparts, the Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, and the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.  Similarly, I will be using these meetings to ensure the importance of the unique circumstances for Ireland is fully understood at Cabinet level in the UK.  I am conscious that a decrease in the value and-or the volume of exports to the UK will directly affect Irish industry, including SMEs and agrifood sector enterprises.  Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients which export to the UK.  A key element of counteracting Brexit impacts will be to diversify exports to third markets by growing client participation and sales into these markets.<\/p> <p>Last week during international markets week, more than 140 international market advisers from over 30 Enterprise Ireland overseas offices returned home to assist over 400 client companies with developing new global export plans in the context of Brexit.  At my request, Enterprise Ireland has extended its schedule of Minister-led trade missions with 36 missions and events in 2016 and a further 32 other trade events for the second half of 2016.  During the next six weeks, I will be leading several trade and investment missions to the US, China and Japan.  The UK is and will remain a key market for Enterprise Ireland clients.  The agency will continue to help exporters deepen and strengthen their presence there by helping them become as lean and as innovative as possible.<\/p> <p>Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the EU already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the EU.  These agreements, such as the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week, and future agreements in progress such as those with the US, Mexico, South American nations, Vietnam, Singapore and the EU-Japan free trade agreement, will all create sizeable new and diversified market access opportunities for Irish exporters.<\/p> <p>This week's Budget Statement contains many measures which will assist Irish business to become more competitive and cope with the impact of Brexit.  This includes an extra &euro;52 million to support further job creation, innovation and support Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit.  Importantly, we have secured additional moneys which will provide for an extra 50 staff for my Department and its agencies.  The staff will be specifically tasked with assisting companies adjusting to the challenges faced as a result of Brexit, securing new business and innovation opportunities and diversifying into new markets.  In addition, the rainy day fund of up to &euro;1 billion per annum from 2019 onwards, announced as part of the budget, can be utilised in the event of a Brexit-related downturn or another global shock.<\/p> <p>In our collective efforts to address the challenges arising from Brexit, we should not overlook whatever opportunities may emerge for Ireland on account of the UK's withdrawal.  That is why I have directed IDA Ireland to explore the potential for winning more foreign direct investment.  This will not be easy.  The global foreign direct investment market is extremely competitive and we must fight hard to secure each and every new investment into Ireland.  Other countries will also be doing their best to win potential new investments which may arise on account of Brexit.  Thankfully, in our efforts to win more foreign direct investment, we can continue to rely on the selling points which make investing in Ireland attractive in the first place.  The challenge for us is to make sure that these messages are communicated to the international business audience.  It is for this reason my Department recently made &euro;500,000 available to IDA Ireland to strengthen its communications capacity.<\/p> <p>As for the implications of Brexit for relationships between North and South, it goes without saying our No. 1 priority is to ensure, no matter what happens, the peace process is protected and safeguarded.  This view is shared fully by the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  My particular focus though is on the commercial and trade implications of Brexit for Ireland and the Border region in particular.  Much will depend on the nature of the deal which will be negotiated between the UK and the EU.  The Government will not be slow during that process to highlight our unique economic ties with Northern Ireland.  We will also be doing our utmost to protect the interests of those companies and businesses which engage in cross-Border trade.  InterTradeIreland, the cross-Border body tasked with supporting trade and commerce between North and South, will have an important role to play in this area in the time to come.<\/p> <p>The EU's programme Horizon 2020 is an important source of funding for research and innovation activities in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It enables us to amplify the impact of domestic public investment by leveraging complementary funding from the EU.  In addition to funding, Horizon 2020 provides a mechanism for researchers and companies in Ireland to network and collaborate with the best researchers and leading companies across Ireland and Europe.  These benefits are particularly important for a small island nation.  While the UK is the largest source of partners for Ireland in Horizon 2020 programmes, it is not by a large margin and we continue to strengthen our relationships with other European countries.

As the Minister has outlined, there are many serious implications, but this is not of Ireland's doing.  I will outline some of the things we are trying to keep an eye on.  Our unique relationship with Britain has been built up over years.  Safeguarding the work and progress made in the peace process is evidently going to be one of the key points.  The prospect of going back to a hard Border is a serious concern for everyone involved.  All these issues have to be teased out, and we will have to wait to see what will realistically happen in practice.  That is the key thing that we have to get around.<\/p> <p>I am disappointed that the First Minister in the North was not as keen on certain proposals.  Perhaps it was not handled as well as it could have been by the Government, although I am not getting political about it.  The prospect of an all-Ireland forum to discuss Brexit was suggested as the way forward, but politically it did not work out for whatever reason.  It would have been a great help if we had all tried to sing off the same hymn sheet.  Perhaps it was never going to be that simple.<\/p> <p>The common travel area is going to be an area of concern and Brexit is feeding in to that.  Our strong trade links with the UK are vital.  We know the figures.  In agriculture, 55% of our beef exports are to the United Kingdom as are 30% of our dairy exports.  These are concerning figures.<\/p> <p>I am curious about two points, and the Minister might consider discussing them with her Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister hit on the point about the money available in the budget from 2019 onwards.  I was a little disappointed that there was nothing more forthcoming in the budget to put more money into the system and to front-load it and in some way do a little more.  Since this is such a serious issue, there is another thing we should have looked at.  Britain has done it, and I suppose it had to because it is going to affect the people there directly and it was their decision.  We should have appointed a junior Minister or made a position to deal with Brexit.  It would have shown how serious and earnest we were.  As we know, it is probably going to have the most serious economic impact, apart from cultural and social impact and so on.  We will see a new shifting landscape in time to come.  We could have appointed a junior Minister to deal with this specifically, if not a full Ministry.  These are some points the Minister might take on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#U00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House again.  I welcome much of what she had to say in her opening statement.  Obviously, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU is a major risk to Ireland's economic recovery.  The Government has taken this seriously.  I imagine we will not know the full extent of the risks until the negotiation process is complete.  Already, we have seen the impact of falling sterling on our exports.  We are a small, open economy and an exporting nation.  It is important to restate that there will be no immediate change to the free flow of people, goods or services between our islands for quite some time, at least until Article 50 is invoked and for two years thereafter.<\/p> <p>The bottom line is there will be numerous challenges for us.  One is the significant uncertainty in the coming two years while the UK negotiates its withdrawal.  We know that it has the potential, if we are not mindful, to reduce economic growth by 1.2% over two years, which corresponds to &euro;2.5 billion.  Access for Irish goods to the UK market, which is our largest market, as alluded to by the Minister, will be more difficult than heretofore.  Irish goods are likely to be more expensive in the UK.  The Government is cognisant of this and it is taking measures to help exporters.  The possible re-introduction of hard borders is something Senator Davitt and the Minister have mentioned.  These are things that we would very much guard against.  As the Minister has pointed out, I do not believe the UK wants this either.<\/p> <p>Advantages may come our way too as the only remaining English-speaking member state in the EU.  We have a chance to attract businesses and investors who were either investing or planning to invest in Britain but who are now unsure.  Ireland has become the sales platform for many goods for other countries outside the EU.  That can now become the case for UK goods as well.  IDA Ireland has a major opportunity to entice would-be UK companies into Ireland.  Many financial services companies, for example, have already signalled their intention to leave London for new European bases.  It is in our interest to attract them as well.<\/p> <p>Let us consider the impact already.  We have seen one major project in Belfast, a &pound;25 million office block, shelved as a consequence of the Brexit vote.  There is extraordinary potential for attracting jobs and investment.  We have heard the Minister speak of her plans for further trade missions and for diversification into other markets.  I welcome that, as, I am sure, does the House.<\/p> <p>Clearly there are major challenges for our exporters.  Since the UK voted to leave the European Union, the Government has been proactive in setting out Ireland's concerns, putting plans in place and ensuring our voice is heard at the highest political level throughout Europe.  We have heard the Minister state that this is a top priority for her and every Minister, Department and agency.<\/p> <p>The Minister has alluded to the next steps.  These will include an all-Ireland civic dialogue on Brexit, with the initial meeting to be hosted by An Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 2 November.  We know that Brexit has the potential to impact on all businesses, but it is up to us to support business to ensure the impact is not negative.  High-level Government meetings have taken place with Michel Barnier, the newly appointed European Commissioner and chief Brexit negotiator.  He visited Dublin this week.  Ireland has possibly more to lose from Brexit than any other European country.  We must ensure our concerns are dealt with at the highest level.<\/p> <p>As the Minister has pointed out, the UK accounted for a little under &euro;14 billion of Irish goods exported in 2014 and &euro;20 billion of services exports.  In fairness, the Government has introduced measures in the budget which will help to soften the blow of Brexit.  It is reducing capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, albeit with the lifetime limit remaining at &euro;1 million.  This is something the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said will be reviewed.  This is not Brexit specific, of course, but it is a help nonetheless.  The Minister for Finance has also extended and amended the foreign earnings deduction to help Irish exporters diversify export markets.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition, there was an extension of the contentious special assignee relief programme to help businesses to relocate key staff to Ireland, an increase in the earned income tax credit for self-employed taxpayers to encourage entrepreneurship and the introduction of an income averaging stepout in the agriculture sector because of expected volatility in demand for food products following severe price fluctuations.  <\/p><p>It is welcome that the 9% VAT rate to help the tourism industry will remain in place.  This is very important because tourism, one of our major industries, is affected by the weak pound.  We must do everything we can to continue to encourage the huge number of visitors who come to the country from the United Kingdom.  <\/p><p>This is a worrying time for farmers.  A &euro;150 million loan fund will be developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to improve cash flow management for them and reduce the cost of short-term borrowings.  <\/p><p>Brexit presents a great opportunity for Ireland.  Many companies in Britain are considering relocating here and since the result of the referendum the Government has demonstrated that it has a steady hand on the tiller.  We are already encouraging these companies to move here and will develop further incentives for them to do so.  The fact we are now the only English speaking nation in the European Union is a great advantage.  In my constituency of Fingal which is quite near the border we have a wonderful opportunity because of the increased numbers passing through Dublin Airport, access to Dublin port and excellent infrastructure, including motorways.  We need to encourage IDA Ireland and the Minister who was in my constituency with officials from IDA Ireland to support us further in making sure we have sufficient advance factories and other supports available for those who considering relocating to the area.  It is an excellent area to which to relocate, with a young, diverse and well educated population.  The fact that we now have more than 2 million citizens at work, the unemployment rate is under 8%, the economy remains the fastest growing in the European Union and that we are now able to borrow money at a rate of less than 0.5%, whereas before it was 14%, shows that the country has the capacity to deal with this challenge.  My appeal is that we make it an opportunity and turn what could be seen as adversity into an advantage.  The Government is making preparations to do this.  I commend the Minister for the work she is doing in announcing the creation of new jobs, encouraging more firms to relocate here and undertaking more trade missions to new markets to diversify opportunities for business people and citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#U00300","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The Senator is a pro; that was exactly eight minutes without me having to tell him his time was up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#V00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The title of this debate is statements on the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  I want to reflect on it.  The most serious consequences of Brexit will be for the Six Counties.  It cannot be said it was the decision of the people of the North of Ireland or Scotland to leave the European Union; it was not.  The opposite is true.  Last Saturday in Bridgend, County Donegal, on the Border with Derry city, I attended a demonstration organised by Border Communities against Brexit.  It was one of six protests held at various locations along what had been a hard border and which could evidently be one again if the Tory Party has its way.  The protests were organised and attended by members of community, business and sports groups and included attendees from both sections of the community and both sides of the Border.  Brexit has united people like never before because it does not make sense.  A mock Border post was constructed in Carrickcarnan.  It was done in jest, but the reality is that this will be the case unless the Oireachtas stands up for citizens and negotiates to prevent it from happening.  Delays at checkpoints, tariffs on trade and passport controls will be standard.  <\/p> <p>Budget 2017 contains Government measures devised to address issues that will arise from Brexit.  They include various tax and economic responses such as reduced capital gains tax, an amendment of the foreign earnings deduction, an extension of special assignee relief, an increase in the earned income tax credit for self-employed persons, income averaging in the agriculture sector and retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism industry.  Economics will be a major factor in dealing with the consequences of Brexit once Article 50 is invoked by the Tory Government, about which we are extremely worried.  There are many other consequences that will impact on people's lives and the Tory Government is at sixes and sevens.  Sterling was in free fall earlier in the week owing to the hard rhetoric being spun at Westminster and by the Prime Minister, Theresa May.  Sterling is probably now the most politicised currency in the world which is extremely dangerous for Irish businesses.  We do not know what form Brexit will take because the British do not know.  It was bravado and chest pumping by right-wing cheerleaders who were full of nationalistic pomp, but they are now picking up the pieces of what was a reckless act.<\/p> <p>What can we do to pre-empt the consequences of the fallout from Brexit?  I note in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready document that we will have a number of arrangements to ensure a whole-of-government response.  They will include the establishment of a new Cabinet committee, giving the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a bigger role and providing for a more focused EU function under a new Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach, integrating international, EU and North of Ireland functions.  These are all welcome developments, but the Government is way behind the tide in developing a response.  It is welcome that the Taoiseach has confirmed an all-Ireland forum will take place in November, but we need to know immediately when it will take place.  In time the DUP, as chief detractor, will be found to be way behind public opinion, as it was when pushing for a \"Leave\" vote.  It took its position, over which it stands, but it was wrong then and it is still wrong.  This is the time to move on without it and go with the best interests of communities across the island.  <\/p> <p>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will be crucial in the months and years ahead.  There have been trade delegations and there are more to come.  I hope they went and will continue to go well and encourage far more in the coming period as we need to support Irish businesses in opening new markets.  Like all State agencies, in recent years they suffered staff and resource cuts.  There has never been a more important time to fully resource both.  This needs to happen now.  We need to get back ahead of the tide.  Protecting existing jobs is of crucial importance.  We have already lost jobs owing to the effects of Brexit on the mushroom industry.  At the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine we listened to deeply worrying contributions on the threats posed to that sector.  These job losses and the volatility in the sterling exchange rate are only the tip of the iceberg.  If direct Government intervention is needed in the form of finance to support these businesses and protect jobs in the short to medium term, we will have to look at providing it.  <\/p> <p>At the protest last weekend I noted the worries of Irish traders, particularly in the Border area.  Traders on this side of the Border are worried about the impact in trading across the Border.  I live on the Border and, as a Buncrana man, this has been a real issue.  Depending on the currency exchange rate, businesses in my part of the Border region benefit and the benefits rotate towards Derry and Strabane where one will again see the supermarkets packed this Christmas to the disadvantage of businesses in County Donegal.  <\/p> <p>The sentiment in the United Kingdom that led to the vote in favour of Brexit was one of anger and resentment, particularly in working class areas in England, but they turned their anger the wrong way.  This may also happen in America if people vote for Donald Trump, as well as in other elections across the world.  Sometimes people who have been failed by the political system turn their anger the wrong way and vote against their own interests.  The economic, social and political ideology of the Government which is all too similar to that of the establishment elsewhere in Europe needs to change.  Sinn F&eacute;in was critical of the European Union when it needed to be in the past and has sought to hold it to account.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have four MEPs seeking to hold the European institutions to account.

Those of us who believe this need to persuade the doubters.  We need to win hearts and minds.<br\/><br\/>Last week, our party held a public meeting in this city to argue the case for the economic merits of a united Ireland.  Our guest speaker was Professor Kurt H&uuml;bner, director of the Institute for European Studies at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, and co-author of the recently published and peer-reviewed report <i>Modelling Irish Unification<\/i>.  I urge all Members to read these important findings.  The lazy assumptions of too many commentators about the economic impact of a united Ireland on the State are robustly rebutted by this independent study and report.  Irish unity makes absolute sense.  The crisis and threat caused by Brexit serves to remind us all of this reality once again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#V00300","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  This subject is very close to my heart as I have many family members who live in the North.  We were all greatly surprised and shocked by the result of the Brexit referendum and are still coming to terms with the possible implications of this decision.<\/p> <p>The setting up of a hard border between the North and South would be a huge setback to the progress made since 1998.  Brexit poses a major challenge to this country.  The economic effect of a hard border and the continuous decline in the value of sterling will have a massive impact on our competitiveness.<\/p> <p>Let me break up this issue into a few topics, the first being the food and drink sector.  An IBEC report states that were sterling to weaken to the 90p mark against the euro, it would result in losses of more than &euro;700 million in food exports and of approximately 7,500 jobs, which is considerable.  Exporters need Government assistance to help with these currency losses as the exchange rate is now extremely close to 90p to the euro.<\/p> <p>Senator James Reilly spoke about tourism.  We all know the tourism sector is one of Ireland's most important sectors economically.  It has significant potential to play a further role in Ireland's economic renewal.  In 2015, tourism was responsible for overseas earnings of &euro;4.2 billion.  Tourism also shapes Ireland's image and attractiveness as a place to live, work and invest.  The UK market accounts for approximately 40% of visitors and any weakening of sterling could be devastating for the tourism industry.  There were 3.55 million visitors to Ireland from Great Britain in 2015.  There probably have been many more this year because of the 2016 centenary celebrations.  British visitors accounted for &euro;995 million in direct expenditure during their trips to Ireland in 2015.  There are over 205,000 jobs in Ireland's tourism and hospitality sector, which supports one in every nine jobs in Ireland.  The tourism sector accounts for one in four of all new jobs created in the State in the past five years.  There is potential to create more than 40,000 additional jobs by 2021.  Tourism accounts for 4% of GNP and generates more than &euro;1.8 billion in taxes annually.  Some of the lowest-paid people are working in the hospitality sector and the prospect of a decline in this industry should not be used to decrease their wages again.<\/p> <p>Farming is one of the topics I am interested in because all my family in the North are farmers.  Negotiations between the European Union and United Kingdom surrounding the latter's decision to leave the Union must take into consideration the links between the farming industries on both sides of the Border.  In a statement made after a meeting between the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Ulster Farmers Union, the IFA deputy president, Mr. Richard Kennedy, said that maintaining a strong trading relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is of critical importance to the economy.  The Common Agricultural Policy accounts for over 80% of farm income in the North.  Following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, this money no longer will be available and it is not at all certain that the UK Government will replace this funding.  This would lead to a crisis in the agriculture sector.<\/p> <p>The people living in the Border regions will feel the impact of Brexit most.  It would be unthinkable to have one part of this island operating within the European Union and another outside it but that is exactly what the British Government is proposing.  It is vital that the wishes of the people in the North, the majority of whom voted to remain in the European Union, be taken into consideration in any further negotiations.  It is possible that Brexit goes against the Good Friday Agreement.  My concern is that the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people on this island will be ignored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#W00200","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#W00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Another concern I have is over the status of Irish people living in the United Kingdom after Brexit.  According to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the right of Irish people to live and work in Britain should not be affected by Brexit.  He told a House of Lords select committee that the British Government stood fully behind its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, including in regard to the right of people born in Northern Ireland to be citizens of the United Kingdom or Ireland and to be treated equally in both jurisdictions.  The committee also heard from Mr. Robin Walker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union, who said maintaining the soft Border on the island of Ireland would be a red line in the United Kingdom's Brexit negotiations with Europe.  Even with these statements, can we be sure this will be the case?  Has the Irish Government received any indications or assurances from the European Union about the post-Brexit status of the many Irish living in the United Kingdom?<\/p> <p>The possible fallout from Brexit for the Irish economy is very worrying, as the progress that has been achieved in the past few years through the sacrifices made and still being made by the people may suffer a real setback with any increase in unemployment in the food and drink, agrifood and tourism industries.  These issues now need to be addressed.  A plan must be made to ensure the negative effects of Brexit should be kept to a minimum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#W00400","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending today to outline the Government's preparations for what will be a seismic event for both islands.  Clearly, a considerable amount of preparatory work has already been done at the front and devoted to this multifaceted challenge.<\/p> <p>I was invited to the House of Commons last May regarding the Irish for Europe campaign.  Those concerned were trying to obtain support among the Irish in the United Kingdom for the cause of remaining in the European Union.  I said to them the United Kingdom did not have a history of referendums and that the Republic had a clear history, with 27 referendums effectively within 27 years.  Unfortunately, the electorate sometimes votes in a referendum on a question that is different from the one put to it.  It may not like the government and may have other issues.  While it is water under the bridge, the referendum absolutely was the wrong mechanism to use.  We are in a very dangerous position.<\/p> <p>I was reminded that a number of supports and measures were announced in the budget this week for those affected.  Senator Mac Lochlainn is correct in that mushroom growers are already going to the wall.  Sandwich makers in Enniskillen are not able to compete.  There is considerable uncertainty over the value of sterling.  Today we hear about the Marmite emergency.  One individual said that while the United Kingdom can do with immigrants being deported, there is a Marmite emergency that must stop.  This is only the start of it.  All the ingredients of Marmite are sourced in the United Kingdom.  Seemingly, Unilever wanted to put up the price and now one cannot get Marmite in Tesco stores.  I am alarmed that this is the first time that people are beginning to take the matter seriously.  Effectively, we are sleepwalking our way into a very dangerous situation.  This farce of a Marmite emergency is drawing attention to the matter.  It just tells us that we are in a very dangerous zone.

The farming and agricultural community is going through a very challenging time, with lower prices internationally and adverse weather conditions.  We simply do not know at this stage what will be the terms and conditions of Britain's departure from the EU.  However, as the Minister for Finance noted in his Budget Statement, we do know Brexit has increased the risks to the Irish economy.  There really are no winners out of this for our country, notwithstanding the opportunities that may present.  Having said that, we must be to the forefront in seeking to avail of any such opportunities.  For example, the European Medicines Agency, which provides 900 top-quality jobs, has indicated that it intends to move out of its Canary Wharf location.  I hope those jobs come to Ireland - specifically, to my constituency in the north west.  I am encouraged that many companies might look to the Republic of Ireland or the island of Ireland as a bridgehead to Europe.  However, we must work hard if we are to realise any advantage in that regard.<\/p><p>On the question of a broader debate involving the public and interest groups, I am looking forward to the all-Ireland civic dialogue on Brexit, which takes place next month.  It will give us an opportunity to discuss the key areas of concern, such as the economy and trade, the common travel area, the Border and the future of EU peace process funding.  We have been guilty of treating our relationship with Northern Ireland and with the United Kingdom very casually, including the &euro;1 billion of goods traded between the two countries every week and the hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by that trade.  Following the Queen's visit to Ireland in 2011, we set up the first British Irish Chamber of Commerce.  That ease of trade was something we took for granted.  Now we are in a situation where we must review all aspects of our relationship with Northern Ireland and the relationship of this island with Britain, Europe and the world.  Everything should be on the table to ensure we work together effectively to lessen the severity of the impact of Brexit as much as possible.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for the work she is doing.

I commend the Government's action before the referendum in doing as much as it possibly could to speak to the Irish community in Britain and all British voters about the importance of this issue for Irish people.  However, no message should go out from this or any chamber which does not state clearly that Brexit is an absolute, complete and unmitigated disaster.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, came to the House, I talked about the importance of European connectivity, noted that the EU has in general been a force for good, born out of the ashes of the Second World War, and that we must re-evaluate the European project.  The UK exit from the Union, at the behest of the people of England and Wales, is a disaster for Ireland and the EU.  As Senator Mac Lochlainn rightly noted, it was narrow-minded nationalism and the whims of a small group which took over the mindset and mainstream of British politics and led to this disaster.  That mindset is being replicated, unfortunately, across the world.<\/p> <p>The regional development committee, of which I am a member, recently received a delegation from Blacklion in County Cavan.  I was interested to hear about Senator Black's connections with that area, particularly as own mother is from Blacklion and my grandfather was an IRA volunteer in the Civil War.  He was imprisoned, went on hunger strike and escaped  before spending the rest of his life as a customs officer on the Border, which was an ironic change of career.  My mother recalls there being a time zone difference between North and South during the Second World War.  The delegates from Blacklion told us that Brexit has already had a devastating impact on their community.  People who were envisaging buying homes in Cavan and working in Enniskillen are pulling out left right and centre, with their plans for their future and raising their families in disarray.<\/p> <p>In recent years, because we have come to a collective complacency around peace in Europe and peace on this island, we never envisaged that this would happen.  A case currently before the High Court in Belfast, which Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has mentioned in the House, involves a challenge by all but one of the major political parties in the North to the constitutional validity of what the British Government has done.  Their argument is that it requires a vote of Parliament in order for Brexit to proceed and that no such vote has taken place.  I am interested to hear the Minister's view on that case.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Government's announcement that an all-party forum will take place at the beginning of next month.  We in this House are national politicians and we must think of the country as a whole.  The Border region will be particularly affected by this issue.  In our negotiations and discussions about what happens next, we must be mindful of that impact.  The message needs to go out from the Government to all our European partners that this no small deal.  If any other EU member state has sympathy with what Britain has done or feels there might be some political advantage in going down that road itself, we must say to it that this has been an unmitigated disaster.  We cannot say there are advantages in it for Ireland.  The message from this country must be that this was a right-wing conspiracy which has gone belly-up and will cause untold misery economically and socially across the Continent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#X00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#X00300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Any dilution of that message would be a major mistake for this Government to make.<\/p><p>Senator Black has brought a section of the Minister's speech to my attention.  A motion was passed in this House last week, drafted by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, concerning the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA.  The Minister stated:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the EU already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the EU.  These agreements, such as the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week ...<\/blockquote> <p>Is the Minister mindful that this House rejected that particular agreement, by way of Senator Higgins's motion, and will she respond to that?  Is it something she will take into consideration?  I am not sure whether there has been a vote on the matter in the Lower House but this House had a robust debate on it and most Members rejected the idea of this deal.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to ensure the Government places a particular focus on the Border regions in considering the impact of Brexit, is mindful of not being complacent about the peace process North and South and is an absolutely unwavering advocate for the European project.  Minsters must speak in stark and forthright terms about how damaging this whole event has been in order to ward off other member states from going down the same road.  I ask the Minister to respond to the expressed will of this House on the particular trade agreement to which she referred.  I wish her well in her endeavours but I reiterate that there should be no message from this House or from Ministers which dilutes the reality that Brexit is an unmitigated political, economic and social disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#X00400","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the Minister to the House.  I thank her for her thorough remarks.  I am greatly enthused that the suggestion made by Senators from all sides of the House following the outcome of Brexit vote to have a series of debates with the relevant Ministers has been arranged by the Leader of the House, and we have had a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, this week.  That is extremely welcome as we dissect the impact of Brexit and try to plan for the next few years while Article 50 is being invoked.<\/p> <p>I was greatly enthused by the Minister's address and I followed it on the monitor upstairs.  I welcome many of her comments and her commitment to her Department.  It is vital that Ireland takes an aggressive step to counter Brexit and makes sure everyone knows we are open for business, that we are up for trading with all nations, including Canada, and that we will continue along this path to make sure that Ireland makes the most of what is an absolute and unmitigated disaster.  In that respect I fully agree with Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  Brexit presents Ireland with many challenges but it also presents us with a few small opportunities that we can definitely make the most of but we need to be proactive and work on them now.<\/p> <p>Last week in the House I raised with the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, the case for bringing the European Medicines Agency from London to Ireland, preferably to Dublin.  The Department of Health is chasing hard to achieve that objective.  That is the attitude we need to take, and that is welcome.<\/p> <p>The financial services sector is another area where there is a good opportunity for us to create additional enterprise and employment.  This sector already accounts for 8% of our GDP, and 30% of the jobs in that sector, many of which are back office jobs, are located outside Dublin.  County Kerry is a particular hub and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, was there with Deputy Griffin last week.  I appreciate that her Department, together with Deputy Flanagan's Department, are constantly putting the competitive case for Ireland as being a viable alternative for financial services companies and institutions seeking to relocate from London.  Dublin is especially on the platform against rivals such as Luxembourg, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, but there are one or two other obstacles.  I have already raised the issue of the delay in processing banking licences.  It takes twice as long to get a banking licence to operate in Ireland as it does in Luxembourg, which takes a little less time than Paris.  When companies want to move their jobs, that is one of the issues that comes up.<\/p> <p>Another issue that arises is that of accommodation.  I read quite a number of public and private reports from financial institutions, media groups such as Bloomberg and Politico and some of the big financial houses here and in London and they say there are two great obstacles in moving to Ireland but more specifically to Dublin.  We want to see as many jobs moving across the island but when it comes to financial services, for front end jobs, Dublin is a key location.  We already have the International Financial Services Centre.  It is not the be all and end all but Dublin is our international comparative city.  The issue that keeps coming up is the availability of accommodation, both residential and commercial.  In terms of residential accommodation, I have full faith in the action plan for housing launched by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I commend the Government on it.  I hope what it proposes comes to pass.  However, we are not paying enough attention to the provision of office space and I call on the Minister to examine that area.  <\/p> <p>A great report was published by Savills during the week which highlighted that 35 projects are under way in terms of building large-scale commercial developments in the city, but of those 35 developments, 60% are already let.  When we have companies seeking to relocate, probably within two to two and half years time, they need to know that they will be able to move full-scale jobs to Dublin, the 900 jobs that Senator Reilly spoke of and the big companies like BNP Paribas and HSBC.  That is what we want to attract.  We need to get the message out that we are on top of that issue.  I would like the Government to follow up the action plan for housing with an action plan for office space.  It is not glamorous.  It is something I said earlier and got mocked for mentioning because I am not very good at coming up with catchy titles.  It would be very worthwhile.  <\/p> <p>We can continue to suggest that Brexit was a disaster, but the major challenge it poses presents some small opportunities that we will be required to take in order to offset the disaster that is Brexit and the obvious decline that we will see across the country.  I wish the Minister well in her endeavours.  I know she is travelling next week to sell Ireland on the international stage.  As a nation we are great at that.  People say that Irish pubs are the best small embassies in the world but this Government and the previous one during the past six years have done much to repair the image of Ireland, which was in the gutter in recent years.  I commend the Minister on her work  and I wish her the best.  I hope she will be able to take on board the need to tackle the problem of commercial vacancies, particularly in Dublin.  Let us use that to our advantage and bring as many financial services jobs to Dublin as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Y00100","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The last shall be first and the first shall be last.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a cur i l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; m&eacute; buartha gur chaill m&eacute; &eacute;.  I am sorry I missed the Minister's contribution in the Chamber but I read through it subsequently.<\/p><p>I will avoid going into the whole broader politics of Brexit with the Minister because we have debated that issue at length, and some may even accuse us of debating it <i>ad nauseam<\/i>over the last few weeks.  It is something I raised consistently before the Brexit vote.  I am getting to the point now where we need to get beyond the long-fingering and the benign bland statements, &quot;We do not know, we are preparing, we are talking.&quot;  I am not advocating a haphazard, knee-jerk or reactive approach to this, but the negative implications of Brexit are happening now.  They are happening today, they were happening yesterday, and last week and last month, and there is much worse ahead of us.  I am not the only one who has that view.  Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and one of his famous lyrics is: &quot;You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows.&quot;  The wind is blowing very much against our favour in this regard, and it is blowing very coldly and, unfortunately, very loudly from a Tory Administration in London, which does not give two damns about the welfare of anywhere beyond the south east of England, let alone the north east of Ireland.<\/p><p>I would like to use this opportunity with the Minister present not to grandstand around the political implications of Brexit but to draw from the response at the weekend rallies along the Border, which were very well attended, and I took great heart from the fact that they were very broadly attended.  There were people there from every community.  There were people there from a broad range of political parties.  People spoke from the platform at the rally I was at on the Louth-Armagh border, people from the trade union movement, the community and voluntary sector, the agricultural sector and the chambers of commerce, North and South.<\/p><p>A number of tweets were put up during the course of that rally.  I want to refer to a few of them.  They include the following tweets: &pound;4.4 billion of business is done by businesses in the South with businesses in Britain; 60% of produce sold from the North is sold to EU member states; 30% of milk produced in the North is processed in the South; has England not learned that imposing an English solution on an Irish situation is doomed to failure; and does Nigel Farage represent us?<\/p><p>They also include the following comments: 40% of farmers' produce in the South goes to Britain, what will added tariffs do to working farming families?  Other tweets include the following: EU peace funding helps some of the most marginalised in our society into employment, improves connectively, assists carers, I do not think we are going to get a replacement of those funds from the British Chancellor; and the scary thing in all of this is the British never planned for this, they are flying blind and that is very dangerous.<\/p><p>The following is a tweet from the representative form the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce: we do not want to see Newry boom and bust, we do not want to see Dundalk boom and bust, we want to see both of them grow and proposer together, this is going to put small businesses along the Border out of business, it is as simple as that.  This Brexit is four square, head on a challenge to the future well-being of us all.  With the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Unionists have constitutionally recognised that the North is not like Norfolk or Devon.  This Brexit will be a crisis that risks reversing all the progress we have made here.  As everyone knows, regardless of the common travel area here in the past, the Border was hard, what broke that was joint membership of the EU and the advance of our peace process.  How do the proponents of Brexit think it will help employment regeneration and welfare in this region?  Anyone concerned about the future economic welfare of this island should be worried.  <\/p><p>One comment that struck me was the contribution of one business leader who highlighted the hypocrisy of Brexiteers when they tell us there will be no return to a Border of the past when the whole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>of their Brexit campaign was about borders.  It is exactly what they have done.<\/p><p>I will finish on the following point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The community along the Border has been quiet on this issue for too long, but that is the end of that.  We now have a mobilised, organised, energised and above all concerned broad range of society, North and South, who are making it very clear that the economic and social implications are massive and tangible, and, back to my original point, they are live and ongoing.<\/p><p>Many messages have been advocated on the floor of this Chamber and rightfully should go from this Chamber.  Senator Mac Lochlainn made clear the benefit of exploring the Kurt H&uuml;bner report into Irish unification.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned other issues regarding InterTradeIreland.  I ask her to expand on the role she envisages for InterTradeIreland as opposed to just saying it will have an important one; that goes without saying.<\/p><p>The most important message is that 56%, a majority, of people in the North voted to remain.  That should be our stance and the stance of the Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Y00200","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Z00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions, which we will take on board.  I have taken a note from each of them.  Today's debate has provided a helpful opportunity for further engagement on the matter of key importance for Ireland and the EU.  The issues raised today will help to inform my Department's policy deliberations in this sphere, as we move towards the detailed negotiations that lie ahead.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators have rightly mentioned the impact of Brexit at regional level.  Of course, Brexit remains a key challenge across all the regions and especially, as the previous speaker mentioned, along the Border.  While the full impact of Brexit is still uncertain, businesses around the country with significant exposure to the UK market, for example, in the agrifood sector, are already feeling the effects of the weak sterling.  In addition, companies that had been considering scaling up their operations have put plans on hold in light of the uncertainty.<\/p> <p>The implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities that the decision poses for the regions has been discussed at meetings of the implementation committees for the regional action plan for jobs that have taken place since the June decision.  I have attended those meetings.  The regional action plans, which build on the template of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, seek to build on local strengths and deliver jobs across every region, in partnership with the enterprise sector.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that in regard to Brexit, the priority areas for this Government remain unchanged.  In all negotiations, the Government will seek to ensure that the best possible outcomes will be achieved for our citizens, for the economy, for Northern Ireland and for the common travel area.  I will ensure that my Department plays its part in this regard.<\/p> <p>We will seek to preserve our existing full-market access to the UK in the framework of any future trade deal between the EU and the UK, and in line with the Government's position that access to the Single Market must be on the basis of full acceptance of all four freedoms - goods, services, capital and people - which is in accordance with the stated position of the EU.<\/p> <p>As I outlined earlier, I expect to meet my two UK counterparts, the Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, and the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark, in London shortly, where I will discuss issues of common interest in regard to the areas of Single Market and trade.  I will also use these meetings to convey the Government's objective of ensuring the best possible outcome for all parties in the UK exit process.<\/p> <p>Separately, I have already had valuable meetings at the European Commission and the European Parliament, conveying the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland to the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, the Commissioner for Trade, and the Chair of the Internal Market Committee of the European Parliament.  In addition, senior officials from my Department have ongoing engagement with their UK trade and Single Market counterparts in London to monitor relevant EU-related issues relevant to my Department.<\/p> <p>Following the recent announcement by the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, of the March date for triggering the Article 50 process, it is essential for Ireland and Europe that the transition process now moves forward in the most pragmatic manner.  In this regard, the Government, including my Department, is continuing to intensify our preparations and to develop risk analysis and contingency plans.  Of course, Senators will appreciate that detailed contingency planning is challenging given the lack of certainty in regard to what new trading and other arrangements may be put in place between the EU and the UK.  As part of these preparations, I will continue to lead the co-ordination of the ongoing response, both of my Department and of the enterprise agencies to challenges as they emerge.  I will continue to maintain open communication channels with colleagues at EU and UK level in order to ensure the best possible outcomes.  I again assure Members of this House, that the Government, my Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting business and all of our stakeholders in this period of heightened uncertainty.<\/p> <p>I was asked about the CETA agreement.  The provisional application of the CETA agreement has been approved by a Government decision.  This is for provisional application of the agreement and approval by both Houses is not required at this stage.  Approval of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will be required for the final ratification of CETA.<\/p> <p>I was asked about InterTradeIreland.  InterTradeIreland is one of the North-South bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It has a targeted portfolio of programmes to assist businesses, especially SMEs, including to stimulate cross-Border trade.  Already in the first part of 2016 it has had a job-creation impact of 739 people and 1,512 companies were engaged in cross-Border business through Enterprise Ireland's programme.  I have met representatives of InterTradeIreland in this context when we were discussing the action plan for jobs for the Border region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Z00300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I asked the Minister at the time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Z00400","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Sorry, there is no-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101300002#Z00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1476351000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I asked the question earlier on.
