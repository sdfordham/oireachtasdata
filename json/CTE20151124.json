Volatility is the term given to the frequency and significant and unpredictable fluctuations in a product or commodity value.  It is a normal feature of the market but it has increased in the dairy sector for various reasons.  Typically, it is a question of mismanagement between supply and demand but there are other factors at play.  Understanding it is important because if we understand we can de-risk it and try to out-perform it.<\/p> <p>  Dairy and food are unusual in that minor changes in supply and demand, scarcity or oversupply can lead to major changes in pricing.  The reason for that is the lead and lag in dairy is typically one to three years, unlike other industries, such as the auto business where production can be turned off and on very quickly.  The frequency and magnitude of volatility have changed over the past 25 years.  For the first 17 years the rolling average showed very little movement, at plus or minus 10 cent per litre.<\/p><p>Since 2007, the frequency and magnitude have increased quite dramatically.  Members can see this on the graph that it moved from +\/-10 to +\/-24, a 240% increase in that period.  That is more than commodities like oil have changed in that period.<\/p><p> There are five or six reasons that volatility is increasing.  One is that we have moved in dairy from a regulated market to a free market.  There is very little product subsidisation and there are no refunds nowadays.  Intervention is well below market levels and we are operating in a global market.  The second factor is that weather shocks are having a bigger impact.  Food, particularly dairy, is now being produced at very intensive levels in parts of the world and it is more prone to weather shocks.  Interestingly, about 700 notable natural disasters were recorded in the year 2000, while in 2014, there were over 900, so there are more global weather events taking place, which may be part of global warming.  Trade policy also has an impact, particularly on the demand side.  We have seen what the Russian ban has done since it was introduced in August 2014.  Bilateral agreements have also impacted on trade.  In terms of stock, since the credit crisis back in 2007-2008, there is much less of both private and public stocks than heretofore.  The result is that when the market is overheating, there is no buffer stock to release onto the market to cool it down and when a market is very weak, buyers seem to buy less stock to tighten up the market.  That has had an impact, as has the availability and speed of data, in terms of how quickly one can get data through the Internet and how quickly it is analysed.  That has added to the volatility, as have hedge funds, dairy auctions and futures trading.  We know from the dairy auctions that take place, particularly the GDT, that when the market is tight, prices shoot up very high.  It magnifies the peaks and the troughs.  A further complication in an Irish context is the seasonality or the grass-based nature of our milk production.  As members can see from the graph, we have a peak to trough ratio of about 7:1, whereas the rest of Europe is quite flat.  If 75% of the milk is produced over a short period - maybe 50% of the year - and the market is very firm then and much of the milk is bought at that price, or indeed if the market is very weak then, it compounds the volatility, whereas the flat curve, which occurs in the rest of Europe, almost has a natural hedge built into it.<\/p><p> What has Ornua been doing to help insulate farmers against volatility?  We have a six-point plan, which we have been working on since 2011.  That is around growing the brand, particularly Kerrygold.  Brand prices tend to operate in narrower tramlines than commodity prices.  That has worked quite well.  We have also spent a lot of time on and have invested in technology and innovation to develop value-added ingredients.  If customers are buying a value-added ingredient, they tend not to be able to switch to alternatives, so there is some protection in that.  The third factor is diversification, both geographically - Ornua sells products in 110 countries - and in sectors.  We operate in retail, food services, ingredients and across a wide range of products.  That is probably a bit unlike our peers, who may focus on one market and one product.  We have also worked hard on strengthening the supply chain with key blue-chip customers in that we do long-term contracts, we look at ways of working together and we build in price points and tramlines, which help to take out some of the volatility.  For the past four years, we have supported the processors with guaranteed fixed milk price schemes, where we effectively link customers with the farmer on fixed price contracts.  Since 2012 we have put much focus on, and resources into, building up a trading team, which will take some knowledge and expertise from other sectors to help manage volatility in terms of using the financial markets to hedge and de-risk our physical positions.<\/p><p> Has this strategy worked?  We would say it has.  Members can see on the graph the purchase price index, which is the index of what we pay for a product by month.  It is based on 2010, which was 100, and members can see that over the past year or so, the swing has been about 10 base points, or about a 10% swing.  This would compare to the GDT, the New Zealand auction, which has swung to the tune of 66% in that period and Dutch quotes, which are more representative of European prices, have moved by about 50% in that period.  The strategy we have in place has helped take out some of the volatility but obviously not all of it.<\/p><p> Moving on to the market and where we are now and where we think it might move to, a good place to start is by looking back.  If members look at the table, they will see that in 2012, particularly the latter half, milk production globally was quite low.  That stimulated high prices.  The prices in turn stimulated very strong production from late 2013 to late 2014.  In fact, globally milk was up about 5% in that period year-on-year, or roughly twice demand or consumption, which was about 2.5%.  That is probably the start of the current problem.  As we moved into 2015, supply quietened down, back towards about 1.25%, but unfortunately the legacy of the stock that was made in 2014, plus the compound growth factor, continues to overhang the market.  Looking at the GDT prices, and we mentioned volatility before, members can see at the start of 2014 whole milk powder, for example, was up at $5,000 per tonne.  It then dropped 70% in the period to August 2015.  It has recovered slightly but is now in slight decline at the last few auctions.  In terms of looking at the current situation, New Zealand milk has slowed but unfortunately probably not enough.  Six weeks ago, there were reports that it could slow by 8% to 10% for the current season.  More recently, they are saying it could be less than half that at 4% to 5%.  That has certainly affected the market in the last two to three weeks.<\/p><p> European production has been very strong recently.  As can be seen from the graph, particularly as we moved into August and September, there are very strong flows year-on-year.  The background to that is probably twofold.  The weather has been exceptionally mild across Europe, typically 6&deg; Celsius to 7&deg; Celsius higher in temperature and feed cost has been quite low.  Obviously, with no quota, farmers have pushed on.  The real point is that European milk production in 2014 was up by 4.5%.  It is likely to be up by 1.5% this year.  That is a compounded 6%, which is a lot of extra milk.  The other thing we need to remember is that Europe is seven times the size of New Zealand when it comes to milk output, so what happens in Europe is key.<\/p><p> Moving from the supply side to the demand side, the Russian ban has had a major impact on EU exports, particularly cheese.  We must remember Russia was importing approximately 30% of EU cheese and butter, or 240,000 tonnes per annum.  This was quite substantial.  In total it accounted for 15% of all EU exports.<\/p><p> The second big demand player is China.  In 2014, it imported a very large volume of powder.  This equated to an additional 2.2 billion litres over the amount in 2013.  At that time, the world thought this 2.2 billion litres was genuine demand, but what subsequently transpired on looking behind the figures was that domestic supply in China was down approximately 1.5 billion litres, and therefore the genuine demand was only 700 million litres.  This reduction in supply in China in 2014 related to foot and mouth disease, poor weather conditions and farm regulations.  Since 2014, these have been corrected, domestic supply has recovered and imports in 2015 have reflected this.  Not only has domestic supply recovered but demand has slipped a little as the economy in China has slowed.  China is still trying to digest the high stocks imported in the second half of 2013 and 2014.  It is trying to absorb these stocks.  It is also trying to digest its recovery in domestic supply and cope with somewhat reduced demand.  This has affected its ability to import.<\/p><p> There is some positive news.  Despite Russia and China being out of the market, European exports have been quite good in 2015.  The euro has, thankfully, been very weak which has helped competitiveness.  Dairy prices have been low, which has made them very attractive and competitive.  Many companies, including Ornua, had been building routes to markets outside of Europe in anticipation of quotas being abolished and we are now feeding these routes to market.  An important point to make is that overall Europe exports approximately 10% of its milk, but nearer to 40% of Ireland's and Ornua's volumes are exported outside of Europe.  There is a high dependency outside of Europe and these are the markets that will grow.<\/p><p> On the demand side in the two big blocks there is positive news in the United States and Europe.  Economic conditions have improved somewhat, especially in the United States with quantitative easing and low oil prices helping disposable income.  In addition, daily consumption, particularly butterfat consumption, is making a recovery which is very positive news.  This has started with butter.  Ten years ago butter was the villain in health but now it is seen as a virtue.  This is moving from butter to other dairy products and from retail into food services and food ingredients.  This is very positive news.  Over the past year, butter consumption in Europe has increased by 3.7%, having increased only 0.8% in the past ten years.  There is also a positive story for cheese in Europe and for butter in the United States.<\/p><p> To summarise the market outlook, further supply correction is required.  We have legacy stocks and compounded growth, which are concerning.  We probably need a weather shock or certainly less benign whether to control this supply.  If we do not have this, it will be up to milk prices to correct it.  At this stage, it looks as though even allowing for supply correction with a weather event, it will be the second half of the year before we see a decent pick up.  The market is still digesting the high stocks.  Without China and Russia, demand is probably nearer to 1.5%, and we probably need supply to fall below this level to absorb some of the legacy stocks.  If there is a recovery, it will probably take a little longer to get through to farmers because we need to remember many of the processors and much of the supply chain have absorbed or subsidised milk prices and this has impacted on their balance sheets.<\/p><p> The long-term future is positive.  There are more people in the world, they have more disposable income and they are more interested in dairy as a fat and protein deliverer.  There is no doubt volatility is increasing and it is here to stay.  It will impact on everybody in the supply chain, from farmers through to co-operatives through to marketeers.  From a farmer's perspective, the best approach to manage this involves open market returns, that is, the monthly milk price, with perhaps a volume of milk on a guaranteed milk price scheme.  Certainly in time there should be derivatives and financial markets to hedge some of the risk.  Managing costs and efficient financial planning will be key.  We will continue to focus on the issues we mentioned and improve matters with a view to increasing returns and managing volatility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Ornua representatives for their presentation, which I found very interesting.

This signifies the volatility.  The committee heard about how China was roaring ahead with importing dairy products, but Mr. Collins has told us this was just a blip.  How could this not have been foreseen as being a blip rather than as something sustainable?  Mr. Collins also mentioned an increase of 14% in butterfat in 2014.  How likely is this to be a blip?

Anybody who had listened to them would not have been surprised by what has emerged and I compliment them on this.  They stated that for the three years prior to 2014 things were going great and the average was going from 20 cent to 40 cent, with an average of 37 cent or 38 cent in 2014.  The Food Harvest 2020 projection was an increase of 50%, and this coincided with this market volatility, which is a function of supply and demand.  We cannot reinvent this wheel nor can we stop the juggernaut.  We must have a bit a sense here.  Anyone who did basic economics for the junior certificate knows the problem.

As Mr. Collins illustrated earlier, a lot of that, with the powders, was purely artificial.  There was a bit of an increase but having got their own house and various internal factors in order again, they are now back.   What is the prospect of that market ever becoming what it was?  It was 2.2 billion litres in one year.  Mr. Collins stripped it out.  In fairness, the real increase was less than one third of that.  Can we ever get back to that position or where does Mr. Collins see us going in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The Russian market is affected by a political decision.  We cannot circumvent the politics.  There was a political decision taken at EU level.  The EU Commission made a decision that had a significant impact upon that attractive and developing market and left the balloon based upon an active intervention at political level.  Has the EU done enough to mitigate the consequences of that decision or is there anything that can be done in that regard?<\/p> <p>  What is Mr. Collins's view for the medium-term outlook?  When I was studying economics under Professor Sheehy, he always built in the one factor that only God could account for, that is, the weather.  Of course, good weather means a longer growing season, a far greater level of production, better dry matter and better output in terms of protein and everything else.  If one gels the scientific and all the other factors together, there is no surprise.  For any farm organisation or any farmer who comes in to me and tells me that he is surprised and farmers did not know this was going to happen, it was as obvious as the nose on one's face that this was going to happen.  I warned farmers not to be taken in and to build on, and try to increase from, what they had before thinking about investing, which could be millions of euro in terms of them and certainly hundreds of thousands in terms of the investment capacity, and all I was hearing was that Irish farmers were under borrowed or lowly borrowed by comparison with those in other countries. I thank God for that.  I hope not too many of them got caught up in this.<\/p> <p>  What is Mr. Collins's view of the longer-term outlook?  The population of the world and the capacity for affluence in developing economies are important factors.  The population of the world is increasing and we project that by 2025 it will be 8.5 billion or thereabouts.  That is no use unless they have purchasing power.  Has Mr. Collins factored that in?  Does he see that as probably the only saving grace, considering that consumers are switching back to dairy, and particularly consumer preference and, as Mr. Collins stated quite correctly, medical input?  A few years ago, we were all brought up with country butter made by the local farmer.  There was a lot of salt in it, obviously, as a preservative but it was the best.  I have tasted nothing like it since.  Then we shifted off and became conscious of cholesterol and everything else, and now we are shifting back.  Everything is a function of medical assessment at a particular point in time.  How can one tell somebody that ten or 12 years ago butter was bad for you?  Years ago, we always had it with a bit of cabbage.  That was a disaster but now we are switching back.  There is now a plethora of consumer factors.  Actually, I would love to be doing economics now.  It would be very interesting as long as the examiners kept their questions practical and not theoretical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#K00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins for the interesting presentation.

Those are the elements that would really help us along and get markets, which is what we need to do.<\/p> <p>  On the intervention price, there was a lot of talk a few months ago about getting that price up to 27 cent or 28 cent to take some of the pressure off the farmers who were in serious bother.

If China started to get into milk production, especially into powder production, it would have a major effect on Ireland's sector and the European milk sector.<\/p> <p>  I note the fixed milk price scheme makes sense at present, especially when the price is depressed.  At what price, if the markets recover, should farmers consider going into a fixed milk price scheme?  On intervention, the IFA, the banks and others say that the cost of production is 26 cent or 27 cent.  One must have something for the person who is producing it as well.  When should farmers hedge their bets and go in and take the fixed milk price scheme if the markets recover?<\/p> <p>  I note Mr. Collins stated that the markets will not recover until H2 2016, which is a long time away.  It will be interesting to hear the banks outline what measures can be taken to support the sector.

In fairness, if one goes back to the strong production in late 2013 and 2014, that was pre-quota.  Obviously, the China and Russian situations are on the demand side.  They would have happened anyway.  The current situation is not the fault of the quotas being abolished.  The delay in recovery could be associated with quotas being abolished but certainly the epicentre was well before that, both on the supply side and on the demand side with Russia and China.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the United States of America, one will note the increased interest in dairy.  Interest in dairy has been growing steadily over the past three years.  Some of it is to do with dairy now being seen as a healthy nutritional product, particularly butter, and some of it is to do with the fact that maybe American dairy products are not as tasty and flavoursome as European products or, indeed, Irish products.  There is a growth in dairy but there is certainly a big growth in imported dairy into the United States because of the quality of Irish products.<\/p><p> With regard to Food Harvest 2020 and the 50% target, we are getting there a lot quicker than we thought.  Farmers had certainly put plans in place and at this stage of the cycle volumes are a lot higher.  Some of that is a function of the weather being very good this year which allowed things to push on when quotas were abolished.  Some of it is a function of the pre-planning and cows going in on the ground.<\/p><p>  The Chinese market will undoubtedly remain very important but it will not be like the boom we saw in 2014.  It will still be a key market where disposable income and consumption are still growing.  The relaxation of the one baby policy will help milk powder imports into that country.  We know from other countries that China will move on from milk powder to importing other dairy products like cheese and butter, so while it will be an important market China will not have the huge boom in imports as in 2014.  China's domestic supply has recovered back towards 2012 levels.  The question must be asked if it will continue to grow.  There will  be some growth for China's domestic supply but it is an expensive place in which to make milk and it imports many of the raw materials which are needed to make milk for feed and so on.  It will be expensive for China to do that and, while its domestic supply will grow, that growth may not be at the same rate at which it bounced back.<\/p><p> With regard to Russia, I do not wish to comment on the geo-political aspect.  It has the capability to grow its milk production.  It is government policy to try to reduce Russia's dependency on imports and grow a domestic output.  Unlike China, Russia probably has more capability to do that and more of a history of making milk.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the issue of purchasing power.  It is clear that over the last 18 months low oil prices have put certain emerging markets under pressure, particularly in the Middle East and north Africa region, whereas low oil prices benefit the developed world of Europe and the United States.  If one breaks that down further one could probably say that low oil prices are good for cheese and butter consumption in general as these are consumed in the developed world and that low oil prices are probably not so good for milk powder consumption and market growth because the powder is mainly imported by Africa and the Middle East.  An optimal oil price might be around $70 to $75 a barrel and while that price would not be too punitive on the developed world it would certainly help the developing world to import dairy products.<\/p><p> With regard to the guaranteed milk fixed price contracts, Ornua has been involved in these for the past four years and supporting the various co-ops and processors on the contracts.  Ornua thinks it makes sense for a farmer to do a percentage of his or her milk on the fixed price contracts.  Looking at the markets and at the competitive pressures, Ornua believes that a good price of somewhere between 29 cent and 31 cent per litre, including VAT, is probably going to be a fairly decent return over the next three years.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the recovery in 2016.  We believe it will be in the second half of 2016 unless there is a fairly sharp supply correction.  For a correction to be sharp one would probably need a weather event.  There is talk of an El Ni&ntilde;o developing in the Oceania region.  We are not sure of its extent, how powerful it will be or if it will hit the key milk producing regions.  If an El Ni&ntilde;o developed it could shorten the recovery period.  I invite my colleague Ms Anne Randles to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Senator Comiskey asked about the market in Russia, the political situation and what could be done about it.  It was a very unfortunate and depressing initiative which happened just as markets were beginning to turn.  It is an annual ban, it has gone from August 2014 to August 2015, and it has been rolled over for another year.  It is very much a political decision and with politics, as with volatility, it changes very quickly.  It is very difficult to know whether the ban will be lifted but I believe the EU should be prioritising that.  With the other political events happening in the EU outside the agri-food sector, particularly in France, there is a need for our international partners to get together to protect the homeland, as they say.  Bringing Russia back into that process may help to change the political dynamism there.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the development and growth of dairy product markets, it is fundamentally important that the EU prioritises its free trade agreements.  That is where we need to see effort and not only in trying to remove the ban in Russia.  The TTIP negotiations with the US are a huge priority for us and are fundamentally important for the future of dairy in Ireland to give us more opportunities to grow trade across the board, be it our branded consumer business like Kerrygold or on our food ingredient side.<\/p> <p>  China is fundamentally important.  It is not a market that has gone away, it may have just tempered its growth projections.  It is unfortunate that we are on the back foot, to some extent, in accessing the Chinese market because our major competitors there have free-trade agreements.  We would very much like to see the EU prioritise a free-trade agreement with China, at least for diary or agri-food if a multi sector agreement was not possible.  We would like to see a request for the EU to prioritise a free-trade agreement because we are very dependent on exports.  We have been growing routes to markets but we are not always in a comparable situation competitively with the other exporters to those major markets.

Ornua had sought an increase in the intervention price.  The current intervention price is about 21 cent a litre, which is significantly below the cost of production in Ireland and in a number of other countries.  However, there are some member states where 21 cent per litre is not quite so bad - the Baltic states and some of the eastern European countries.  It is a problem for the Commission to know where to set the bar so that it becomes a safety net for everybody.  Despite the misgivings of the Commission we believe there is a need for increasing the intervention price.  Farmers are losing money with an intervention price of 21 cent per litre.  Any operator selling product, and skimmed milk powder in particular, into invention is losing money.  It is a punitive situation.  We see this situation now since intervention was open.  It was slow to take off and for operators to put their products into intervention because they lose money when they put product into intervention.<\/p> <p>  Our customers are looking very closely at the market and they see there is a floor of 21 cent per litre.

Not alone does the agricultural book represent circa 10% of the overall exposures for the bank in the business and agri sector in Ireland, but this year alone, in terms of the volume of drawdowns, agriculture represents over 23% of the total.

I will now hand over to Mr. Farrell, our head of agriculture, to make some brief opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>As Mr. Cunningham outlined, agriculture is a very important sector for Bank of Ireland, and this is particularly evident when we consider our rural-based branches located in the many towns that rely most on the agricultural economy.  Within those branches, agriculture-related lending typically represents over 60% of all business lending transacted through those branches, so it is a very important sector within the branch network.<\/p> <p>  In the overall market and with the requests coming to us in the bank in mind, the typical areas for which customers seek financial support are land purchase, farm development and annual seasonal loan requirements.  We have seen an increase in requests for farm buildings and development from the dairy sector in particular over the past 18 months, despite the downturn in milk prices.  We anticipate that dairy markets will recover from current levels in 2016 and that will prompt additional investment at farm level as farmers capitalise on the post-quota opportunity to expand their businesses.  Our position in the bank is that farm expansion of any enterprise, not just dairying, should be from an efficient base.  However, given the profitability of the dairy sector relative to others, we anticipate proportionately greater growth in the area over the next number of years.  Volatility is key to the committee's business today and, in that regard, our view is that the outlook for agricultural commodities is positive and we expect prices to increase over the next five to ten years.  We do not anticipate the price increase will be linear, as there will be peaks and troughs.  That is similar to what is currently being experienced within the dairy sector.<\/p> <p>  In the bank we take a medium-term view on farm incomes and we will play our role in helping our customers manage through the impact of sudden price shocks in the form of either falls in output prices or increases in input prices.  To that end, within Bank of Ireland we have developed a suite of products that we have termed AgriFlex, which take volatility into consideration and allow our customers to revert to interest-only repayments on borrowings with the bank during times of reduced farm incomes.<\/p> <p>  Looking forward to the remainder of 2015 and into 2016 from a cashflow support perspective, to date there have been few additional requests to what we would normally receive from customers.  The requests we have received to date have not typically been related to milk prices, but have arisen more because of superlevies or other issues.<\/p><p>We do anticipate, however, that there will be increased requests for cash flow support during the first half of 2016.  Farmer overdraft utilisation levels remain very low.  Our typical farming customer started this year in a stronger cash flow position than in 2014.  They have overdraft balances of just 15% of their overall permission levels.  The overall risk profile and credit quality of our agri-customer base has improved through the year.<\/p><p> In the same way as we supported farming customers during the fodder crisis in 2012 and the dairy market downturn in 2009, we will again support them, as necessary, where we are comfortable with the overall viability of the farm.  AgriFlex is one of the ways we can offer that support.  To bear this out in the next few weeks, we are planning to contact our farming customers in writing to invite them to come and meet their local bank adviser should they envisage any requirement for cash flow support in the coming months.  In addition, our team of agri-managers who are based regionally throughout our branch network are engaging with farmers in groups and in conjunction with their advisers and accountants.  Through a case study exercise, we are helping to educate farming customers on their repayment ability andthe importance of cash flow planning.  We are also encouraging them to engage with their local banks at an early stage if they have a future borrowing or cash flow support requirement.  <\/p><p> We will be very happy to answer questions on our support for the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for giving AIB the time to provide the Oireachtas and the public with an update on the bank&rsquo;s continued support for the dairy sector during this cyclical downturn period.  I have been head of business banking with AIB for the past three years.  With me are Dr. Anne Finnegan, head of agri-sector, and Ms Margaret Brennan, head of sectors.  I refer members to AIB&rsquo;s presentation which was submitted to the clerk in advance.<\/p> <p>  When we were before members in February, I outlined how important the farming sector was to AIB and the nature of the very long-term association AIB had maintained with the agrifood sector.  I welcome the opportunity to update the committee on the performance of the sector and AIB&rsquo;s specific programme of support for farming customers since that time.  The demand for credit from farmers, in particular dairy farmers, has remained strong throughout much of 2015.  However, in recent months we have seen some slackening in demand which we had expected as tax bills fall due, farmers postpone non-essential investment in preparation for a leaner income year in 2016 and they await grant approval under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II. <\/p> <p>  We adopted a conservative outlook to 2015 dairy farm cash flow performance, using an annual average milk price of 26 cent per litre, inclusive of value added tax, VAT, for 2015 when budgeting for either new lending or working capital support.  While the milk price has declined significantly from the high level reached in 2014, it is now likely that, based on Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures, the price will average over 29 cent per litre, inclusive of VAT, in 2015.<\/p> <p>  An up-to-date analysis of AIB&rsquo;s dairy farmer customer base again indicates that the sector remains well positioned, with strong cash balances, available overdraft limits and overall strong historical credit performance relative to other AIB small and medium enterprise, SME, sectors.  We welcome the decisions to phase superlevy bills over three years and to pay a significant advance on direct payments, both of which resulted from Government and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine intervention and will serve to alleviate cash flow pressure.  We have been working to support those farmers with high tax bills to spread the cost over the year through the use of our PromptPay facility.  We anticipate that, in the main, working capital pressure will not manifest on dairy farms until quarter 1 of 2016.<\/p> <p>  Our prudence in lending to this sector gives us a level of comfort that whatever income pressure materialises for our customers, in the main, it will be short term in nature.  Our lending to dairy farmers is on the basis of a long-term, through the cycle budget price of 30 cent per litre, inclusive of VAT.  Our focus in the agrifood and all SME sectors is on cash flow lending.  We recognise that Irish dairy farmers are much less indebted than some of their European or southern hemisphere counterparts.  We also recognise that there are structural differences in farming in these regions and that the nature of lending varies greatly, with a greater propensity for intergenerational debt and long-term interest-only facilities.  We believe Ireland&rsquo;s comparatively lower level of indebtedness in the sector does confer some advantage when prices are low.  However, Irish farmers still experience financial pressure, perhaps just not as severely or as quickly as farmers elsewhere.  For AIB, the low level of gearing in Ireland versus that in other countries does not necessarily determine the capacity of the sector to take on debt.  Rather, we seek satisfaction on the strength of the underlying cash flow at individual farm level.   As such, AIB's message for several years has been to encourage farmers to focus on being better before bigger, that investment in expansion should only be undertaken in a very planned manner when existing efficiencies have been maximised.  As I mentioned when we were here before, AIB has been espousing this message in national roadshows in the past year which were attended by in excess of 3,500 farmers.  Since we were last with the committee, we have been proactively engaging with farm stakeholder groups on this theme, including the following events: the Irish Grassland Association dairy summer tour which was attended by 500 dairy farmers; the Macra na Feirme Young Farmer Forum which was attended by 100 farmers; dairy discussion group meetings; participation in a national dairy forum chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the Agricultural Science Association dairy study tour to Northern Ireland which was sponsored by AIB; the AIB-Teagasc Best Farm Business Plan awards for agricultural college students; participation in Irish Farmers Association, IFA, dairy expansion seminars; participation in Teagasc Get Financially Fit seminars.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 we doubled our team of specialist agri-advisers.  These regionally based advisers undertake a detailed farm financial analysis of all substantial farm lending cases and examine the technical management and efficiency of the farm.  The team is not necessarily motivated by sales or lending targets but rather by ensuring the lending proposal is underpinned by a sustainable cash flow which will cover farm costs, adequate living expenses and service capital and interest repayments.  Their time is not spent in recruiting either new AIB farming customers or seeking new lending opportunities but rather in supporting the analysis of lending applications and supporting and training our front-line staff.  We believe this component of our model is key to the long-term sustainability of our lending to the sector. <\/p> <p>  Last spring the general expectation was there would be market recovery in the first half of 2016; however, current market signals suggest the downturn could extend into the second half of 2016 and that recovery may not materialise until after the peak months of Irish production in 2016.  We are in no doubt that many farmers will require short-term working capital support during this trough period.  AIB is committed to playing its part in supporting farming customers through this market cycle.  As we outlined when we were with the committee in February, we have significant experience of supporting the pig sector through various income cycles and the more recent cycles in the dairy sector in 2009 and 2012.  In the past few months our relationship managers have been engaging with those farming customers who might need our support in the near term, encouraging them to make early contact with the bank.  The type and magnitude of support needed will best be informed by the development of cash flow projections for 2016.  We are encouraging all dairy farmers to undertake a cash flow plan for the year.<\/p><p> As detailed when we addressed the committee last February, our support package for dairy farmers during this income downturn includes the following: a review of current monthly repayment commitments; a short-term increase in working capital facilities; short-term loan facilities and, where appropriate, an interest-only period on existing borrowings, with no repricing of existing facilities.  We are utilising our existing core lending products to support the sector at this time, including our farmer credit line which has a variable rate of 4.075%, which is the lowest cost of any working capital product in the farmer market and extremely competitive relative to the cost of merchant credit.  We also have in place a &euro;200 million AIB-Strategic Banking Corporation fund which includes term finance for continued farm investment at a variable interest rate of 4.5%.  All of our customer facing and credit teams have been briefed on the current market situation and AIB's available support measures.  At this juncture, we have not seen a material increase in the number of requests for support, but, as I have said, we anticipate increased engagement in quarter one of 2016.  <\/p><p> We are very conscious of the significant medium to long-term opportunity for the dairy sector and the economy.  We are also aware of the heightened short-term volatility that must be managed, particularly in the next six to 12 months.  As the leading bank to the dairy sector, we recognise the key role that we play in supporting the sustainable development of the sector and supporting it through the full cycle.<\/p><p> In summary, on behalf of the bank, I, again, express our thanks to committee for inviting us.  We very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss with members what is one of our most important small and medium enterprise sectors.  We look forward to answering members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#O00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I am managing director of Ulster Bank's commercial banking division in the Republic of Ireland.

I will focus briefly on the role Ulster Bank plays in the economy and specifically the importance of the agriculture sector to our business.  Dr. Byrne will then cover the support we provide for the sector, focusing on the dairy sector.<br\/><br\/>Ulster Bank is the third largest bank in the Republic of Ireland and the only full service foreign owned bank operating in this market.  Our market share in retail and commercial banking is approximately 14%, while our total lending to business at the end of quarter three of 2015 stood at approximately &euro;6.5 billion.  The improved economic and market sentiment and higher demand for credit that has emerged in recent years have continued strongly into 2015.  As we noted in our recent quarterly financial update, we have seen an almost 60% increase in business lending volumes this year.  We firmly believe that for the economy to continue to recover, it is essential that there be competition in the banking market.  We are determined to provide that competition across all of the sectors in which we operate.<br\/><br\/>Agriculture and the wider food and drink sector are key components of our business and today account for approximately 20% of our total business lending, with the agriculture sector specifically accounting for 12%.  Our banking relationships in these sectors start with the many farmers who bank with us, through to artisan food producers up to the largest multinational food manufacturing businesses.  Our relationships with these customers stretch back decades in many cases.<br\/><br\/>Our strategic ambition is to be the number one bank for customer service and we wish to sensibly grow our market share.  We are focused on making Ulster Bank a customer centric bank that is simpler, more agile and one that offers an appealing alternative to the dominant players in the market.<br\/><br\/>We are supporting Irish businesses not only with funding but also in looking at their wider financial and business planning needs.  Examples include our online mentoring platform for small business that has more than 20,000 registered users - <i>SmallBusinessCan.com and BusinessWomenCan<\/i>.  Our annual business achievers awards which take place next week acknowledge business success and reward companies that have displayed determination and innovation across the island.  This year we have seen a very significant increase in entries in both the agriculture and food and drink categories.  We have dedicated proposition and specific sector support teams for a range of business sectors, including agriculture and food and drink.  Uniquely, as part of RBS, we are able to leverage the bank's international reach, while delivering a strong local presence.  An up-to-date practical example of how we are trying to make a difference for our customers is our support for 25 of our small and medium enterprise food producing customers in assisting them to take space at the &quot;I believe in Christmas&quot; market at CHQ in the IFSC which starts this week.  This will be a great opportunity for some of our customers to showcase their products.<br\/><br\/>We recognise the importance of agriculture to the economic and social fabric of the country.  It has been and always will be a core part of our business.  As such, it is important that as the economy recovers, the development and growth of the agriculture sector be focused, structured and strategic.  We understand the sector and are committed to supporting both individuals and enterprises from farmyards to large corporates.  We recognise that lending must be responsible and fully based on the ability of farmers to generate cash flow to repay debt.

The increased output will be exported and demand will be driven by changing global demographics, reflecting increasing population, greater affluence and urbanisation in developing countries.  However, we also accept that the abolition of milk quotas brings challenges, especially in terms of milk price volatility and the requirement for additional investment in farm infrastructure to facilitate expansion.  Ulster Bank sponsored the Teagasc Moorepark open day in July which provided dairy farmers with an opportunity to view and discuss the latest developments in key dairying technologies to help them to tackle these challenges.  These factors are firmly embedded into the Ulster Bank business and credit strategy for the dairy sector.<br\/><br\/>Ulster Bank continues to lend to the dairy sector for on-farm development and expansion, as well as providing support for our customers in this period of low milk prices.  We have skilled managers who understand farming and offer a range of products to support our agri-customers, including a dairy expansion loan, a pasture loan and a young farmer package.<br\/><br\/>Our agri-training programme is accredited by Chartered Banker and 40 of our relationship managers have completed this course.  As part of their training, this group participated in a farm safety training day at Teagasc during April.  These specialists are supported by our central agri-team.  Despite various financial pressure points in the past, including the dairy sector downturn in 2009, the fodder crises of 2012 and 2013 and various downturns in the pig sector, the Ulster Bank experience with the agri-sector has been positive.<br\/><br\/>The welcome measures introduced in budgets 2015 and 2016 encourage land mobility and better access to land for active farmers.  The farm sector should embrace these measures.  Our support for these measures was highlighted in the Ulster Bank and Teagasc publication, <i>Stepping Stones to a Career in Dairy Farming<\/i>, earlier this year.  A copy of this publication was provided for the clerk to the committee for circulation to all members.  The publication highlights the changing landscape facing Irish dairy producers as they seek to compete successfully on a global stage, while exploring the emerging career pathways available to them, for example, farm partnerships, share-farming and other collaborative farming arrangements.<br\/><br\/>We believe dairy farmers need to continue to develop a broader range of skills.  Greater understanding of technical efficiency, people management and business skills are required to successfully develop farming operations in this increasingly uncertain environment.  This morning I was at Ulster Bank's third young farmer seminar entitled, Embracing Change in Meath, which was attended by more than 60 young farmers.  This seminar, with similar events last week in Cork and Sligo, focused on encouraging young farmers to focus on the skills necessary to develop and grow their businesses.  Our expert panel of dairy and pig farmers who had expanded their businesses in the previous ten years provided key insights into market volatilities, challenges and risks young farmers might encounter as they expand their businesses.<br\/><br\/>The role of women in the family farm business is often under-estimated.  This Thursday evening Ulster Bank will host a women in agriculture event in Mullingar which, among other things, will promote wellbeing and mental health issues for farm families, particularly in times of income pressure.<br\/><br\/>Through our close relationship with all stakeholoders in the dairy industry, we realised last year that dairy farmers might face some financial challenges in 2015 due to a low milk price, a superlevy fine and, possibly, a larger than normal tax bill.  This coincided with a time when many dairy farmers were expanding their activities.  We developed the Ulster Bank dairy farmer toolkit as part of our proactive support for dairy farming customers.  The toolkit provides solutions for farmers, with options such as increased working capital facilities, an interest-only option or a combination of both, depending on individual circumstances.<\/p><p>We encourage all our farmers to analyse their cost of production per litre of milk and to prepare a cash flow budget.  We actively make care calls to our dairy farming customers to outline the support we can provide if they are in difficulties.  We are currently encouraging our dairy farming customers to apply for additional support now in anticipation of a below-cost production price for milk next spring.  As part of our efforts to ensure that farmers are kept informed on relevant issues, yesterday we had an article in <i>The Examiner<\/i>encouraging farmers to prepare cashflow budgets and seek assistance from their bank now in anticipation of a low milk price next spring.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the establishment of the dairy forum by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It has the responsibility to provide recommendations to farmers on how best to deal with future price volatility and as active participants we are helping to drive this agenda.  <br\/><br\/>I reiterate that Ulster Bank is very active in and committed to the agrifood and farming sectors.  Our aim is to partner our farming businesses and to play our part in addressing the difficulties arising from volatility in the dairy market.  We have developed a flexible approach for our customers in difficulty with our dairy farmer toolkit and look forward to further engagement, particularly through the dairy forum, with other stakeholders to consider the range of options to address the fundamental difficulties facing the sector.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and the members for affording Ulster Bank the opportunity to address the committee.

Having listened carefully to the three presentations I am surprised that the garden is in full bloom and there is no sign of a wilt in the roses.  As one who keeps in close contact with those on the ground, the presentations were at variance with my experience of what farmers are encountering.  How are the witnesses dealing with young farmers who are becoming part of the new expansionary wave and availing of those tax incentives for farm transfers from fathers, uncles or aunts to young farmers?  Are they being given two or three years of interest-free loans, interest only loans or any special rates?  They are coming into a challenging global environment.  Price volatility will continue to be a normal cyclical phenomenon.  The days of demand and supply and the days of linear increases are virtually a thing of the past.  How do the witnesses deal with those issues where there are significant trough and valley periods?  For existing farmers are the witnesses prepared to extend facilities without penalties to ensure they are not being penalised?<\/p> <p>  At what rate do the banks borrow money?  It is important to know the mark-up on the money they are getting, particularly in the context of people in a significant adverse environment in terms of market opportunities.  A couple of the banks have different rates, one has 28 cent and one has 26 cent in terms of budgeting.  How critical are the rates?  The average was 38 cent in 2014 at peak and it dropped to an average of 25 cent.  If the witnesses are budgeting for 28 cent and only get 25 cent, how do they handle that situation?  Rates of 4% to 4.5% were mentioned.  I acknowledge that in terms of merchant credit that is very competitive and is a very attractive price.  I salute AIB on its message to encourage farmers to focus on being \"Better Before Bigger\".  That was very prescient.  AIB mentioned that on the last occasion and it stuck in my mind.  If the dairy industry wants to expand it is important that it gets the best returns by way of increased output and efficiencies before embarking upon the path of expansion.  I think that is what that means if I understood it correctly.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank mentioned pasture loans.  Are those available across all the sectors?  Have any of the banks had to reschedule loans so far?  It is good that the banks are meeting the people.  That is pre-emptive and I salute them for that.  When they do a good job they are entitled to be saluted.  We are also entitled to raise questions.  Has the rescheduling of loans been part of their suite of solutions?  I hope there is no problem and that the 4.5% interest rate does not become 4.55%.  Those things are very important because 0.5% could be the straw that will pull one down.  Bank of Ireland has developed a suite of products called AgriFlex.  Perhaps the witnesses would explain if that accommodates loan holidays and  such like, which is very important.  <\/p> <p>  I have great faith in Ornua because it set out the position very clearly for us seven or eight months ago and did so again today.  The witness stated that it could be the third quarter of 2016 before the sector starts to come back.    Let us send out a clear message before anybody is misled.  It could be the third quarter before the smallest shoots begin to appear.  I know Senator Pat O'Neill is a dairy farmer so there is no use in getting excited.  <\/p> <p>  Our focus has to be on the comparative advantages in terms of grass based production.  This is a perfect storm in many ways.  We had the global challenge, the contraction of the milk price and volatility which will continue to be part of the equation.  We had the super levy fines and the taxation issue in October or November which led to ROS.  Have the witnesses - this question is for each delegation - devised any package to accommodate the farming public and the self-employed in terms of how to deal with those situations?  Again, I would be interested to hear the interest rate that would be applied to that type of accommodation, which is essential to ensure farmers continue in business.<\/p> <p>  I am interested to hear what the delegations have done for the young farmers who are coming directly on stream.  We are promoting the acceleration of transfer of ownership to young farmers.  Only about 7% of farmers are under the age of 35 years.  What can the banks do to accelerate that process, allied to the taxation and other measures outlined in the budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#P00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations which were positive.  Ornua has dealt with the dairy industry.  Dairy farmers have had their own difficulties.  It is important that the bank does not apply too much pressure until the market starts to recover and give the people who have made huge investments a chance to come back into the system again.  Questions we are often asked is whether money is being made available for land purchase and if banks are prepared to lend over a longer term.  That younger farmers have got involved in young farmer schemes, leasing land and doing deals with older farmers is welcome.  I would welcome the view of the witnesses on that issue.<\/p><p>It is very important that we help young farmers.  <\/p><p> Deputy Penrose sparked a thought in my head.  Can the banks draw down money from the European Investment Bank and lend it to farmers at a lower rate?  That is important.

I thank them for their presentations.  I welcome the fact that all three banks said they were in constant contact with their customers.  This may be the first year of repayments, because the dairy expansion has only started and it is easy for the banks to be nice to people in the first year as they restructure.  How long are the banks prepared to put up with this downturn before the alarm bells start suddenly ringing and the telephone calls are not as friendly?  In their long-term view, how long have they envisaged this downturn to last?  I predict it will be the end of 2016 before the milk markets improve.  As we heard from Ornua, we need an increase in oil prices and a weather event.  We need those things to alleviate the problems with the milk market at present.<\/p> <p>  Both of my colleagues here raised the fact that Commissioner Hogan announced in July 2015 and November 2015 that the European Investment Bank, through the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, was to make cheap money available to farmers at a rate of 3%, with term loans up to 15%, but that one of our major banks would have to come on board.  Where is this at present?  Are the banks in negotiation with the European Investment Bank to bring it down?  This is relevant to Deputy Penrose's question about the rates the banks are charging.  If the European Investment Bank, through the Directorate-General, is prepared to offer money to farmers at 3%, does it not make a lot more sense to the banks as a sector, if they can get the money cheaper, to pass it on and try to continue to grow the industry?  Where are we in respect of the European Investment Bank moneys?  It is easy to be nice to people in the first year and for the calls to be friendly, but how long do the banks envisage this downturn will continue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#Q00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Before I go back to the witnesses, I have one brief question regarding new entrants and those who may have come into the dairy sector from a different sector in recent years, be it tillage or the beef sector.

Perhaps the most efficient way of doing this is for one bank to lead off on each question and for other banks to add to the answer if they want.<\/p> <p>  One of the first issues referred to was price volatility, and there were a few questions on it.  One was how was price volatility is dealt with by the banks.  As the banks spoke and went through the presentations, they seemed to be at slightly different average prices for budgeting purposes.  This links in a way to a question towards the end about the banks' continued support while prices remain weak and how long the support will continue, in the nice way described.<\/p> <p>  To change the order slightly, perhaps AIB might start off on the area of pricing and continuing support for the sector as prices remain low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>In our submission, we spoke of AIB's experience in managing other parts of the agri sector through the downturn.  We have significant market share and exposure to the pig sector.  It is a factor of the pig business that there are good years and bad.  We help pig farmers plan for the bad years.  They have sinking funds and mechanisms to put cash away to cover themselves during those periods.  As far back as 2013, we were signalling the volatility that we felt was going to hit the dairy sector and that volatility was going to be the new norm.  On whether this is time-bound or relative to our support for the sector, it is not.  We see it as a new norm and one with which farmers will have to get comfortable.  They will have to find ways of managing their businesses, including hedging of commodities and financial products and managing and measuring their own capital investments through the cycle.  We see that this will certainly be a H1 event next year and we are forecasting that in H2 there might be some easing of the situation.  If that were not to happen, it is not something that would faze us.  We speak in our submission of a through-the-cycles price of 30 cents per litre.  We are happy with the business we have written and the capacity of that business to weather any particular continuation of this.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee some figures that might help.  I apologise that the figures are not on the screen, but I know members have the figures in front of them.  A graph shows dairy farmers' current account balances.  The first thing I would say is that overdraft utilisation is at a low level.  The key point I want to bring out is that for every euro that is drawn on dairy farmers' overdrafts in AIB, there is a multiple of four times cover in terms of cash held and surplus cash in other current accounts or deposit accounts.  This gives us real comfort.  Average overdraft utilisation was at 24% during October 2015 and credit balances were up 32% year on year.  This gives us good comfort in terms of management of working capital.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at the outstanding loan balances in the agriculture market reported into the Central Bank, this peaked in quarter 1 of 2009 at &euro;5.5 billion.  In quarter 2 of 2015, the Central Bank was reporting that it was down to &euro;3.3 billion, which is 38% below its peak.  When we take those two figures together, we are not being in any way complacent around this, but we are saying there is a level of headroom in terms of managing those cashflows before one gets really acute pressure or pinch points.  <\/p> <p>  The vast majority of our farmers are on fixed repayments.  They may be on a variable interest rate but their payments are fixed for the duration of the loan.  This gives them comfort in terms of managing their cashflow.  We are proactively engaging and anticipating rather than waiting for a pressure point that might come in quarter 1 of next year.  We are asking our farmer customers to complete a cashflow forecast for 2016 and to anticipate where the pressure point will come and how we need to deal with it.  I will deal with one other point.  A principle of AIB's practice in giving that support is that we do not re-price facilities.  If we are giving a period of interest-only payments or a payment holiday, we are not re-pricing those facilities.  They are offered at the existing price.  <\/p> <p>  \"Better before bigger\" was mentioned.  That is our premise.  The last time we were here we mentioned the income differential of &euro;60,000 per annum between the average top-performing dairy farmer and the bottom 10%, which is significant.  That has been our starting point.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if the committee would like me to deal with the issue now, but in terms of our support, pricing and interest rates, there has been talk about the European Investment Bank.  AIB had three separate rounds of EIB funding.  We replaced the last round of EIB funding.  Our intent was to provide the lowest possible credit we could to our farmer customers by accessing European markets.  We had that third round of EIB funding.  When the Government sponsored and supported the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland, we retired that third round of funding and partnered with the SBCI to bring a &euro;200 million fund to market.  Agri is taking a significant slice of that funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>What is the rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#Q00800","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>It is a 4.5% variable rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>What markup is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#R00100","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy that in reverse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>That is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#R00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448373600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>We have given that at a 2% discount on our standard variable business loan rate.

We have had long-term relationships with our farmer customers and that is where we stand in terms of price volatility.  The question was posed as to how far out we would go in that regard.  I listened with interest to the presentation by the representatives of Ornua, and I agree with their analysis.  We do not anticipate that prices will recover in 2016.  Our modelling goes out to 2017.  We are ready and working with the farmers.  I will hand over to Ms Byrne in a moment, who will provide details on our toolkit.  At this point, a very small number of farmers, numbering fewer than five, have contacted us with a view to accessing our toolkit.  We expect that will change as we move into 2016 and get into spring production.  Right now, in 2015, farmers' cashflow is not too bad.  We all understand the reasons for that, but we are ready, willing and able to support farmers in the spring of 2016 when things change.  We expect that could be a medium-term phenomenon, but we believe the long-term prospects for dairy remain good, as Ornua argued earlier.  The global demand dynamics are still positive for the industry.  As a bank that has been involved in agriculture for many decades, whether it is dairy, pig, poultry or tillage farming, we know that this is a cyclical industry.  Banks have to be ready to stand by and support their farmer customers in periods such as this.  That support is not short term; it is long-term support.<\/p> <p>  We are not currently part of the SBCI, and I do not want to say too much about it because discussions are ongoing.

The toolkit gives farmers an interest-only option or an increase to their working capital facilities or both, depending on where they are in the investment cycle on their individual businesses.  We take a long-term approach to the milk price issue and assess long-term investments at a milk price of 28 cent per litre plus VAT and constituent bonuses.  That is to reassess long-term loans today, given that the milk price in 2014 was hitting 40 cent per litre.  That has always been our approach to our medium- to long-term outlook.  For 2016, we are asking farmers to prepare cashflow budgets on a base price of 22 cent per litre, plus VAT and constituent bonuses.  We are using a low milk price, but we do not have a crystal ball.  We do not know that milk prices will fall to that level, but we would hope that this was the bottom of the cycle.  We are asking farmers to prepare for a worst-case scenario and to look for support at that level for a full 12 months.  We will put the facilities in place to support the business at that milk price for the year, once they can demonstrate long-term viability and sustainability at a milk price of 28 cent per litre.

We anticipate that the situation will be better in year two but, as many others have said, the increased volume of production during the course of 2015 has compensated significantly for the reduction in price.  As a result, the cashflow pressures are not as intense or severe as we might have anticipated at the start of the year.  I note that Deputy Penrose has just left, but on the issue of rescheduling, we have not had to reschedule any loans at this juncture.

The experience to date has been very good for a number of reasons.  I do not have specific statistics but those who have switched, in particular those switching from sucklers to dairy, have had natural advantages that resulted in strong dairy businesses.  In the first instance, typically they have brought significant equity from their existing stocks into their dairy businesses.  They have also been early adapters.  By their very nature, they have already been, in general, good stock people and good at grassland management, which are two of the key elements to be a successful dairy farmer.  They have also had the natural advantage of an appropriate grazing block or other infrastructure.  They have had to invest in the infrastructure and perhaps amend existing accommodation, for instance, to provide a milking parlour.  In general, however, the level of investment is nothing akin to what it would be if it was a greenfield development.  Our experience to date, albeit in a medium to high milk price environment, since they have entered, has been good.  Grassland management is one of the areas they have had to address and they have done so very well.  Given the relative profitability of one sector versus the other, there will be more switchers.  Efficient expansion is recommended and it will obviously not be for everyone.  To date, those who invested in dairy farming and the financial planning required to succeed have been successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>If coming from the beef sector or the suckler sector, farmers will have significant collateral to bring with them.

The fundamental thing AIB looks for in a new entrant from the tillage sector is his or her experience in dairying.  If he or she does not have any experience, there is capacity to hire it in and to manage the dairy operation successfully.  That is the very first thing we look at before we look at anything else.  The barriers to entry in terms of investment are much more significant for a tillage farmer and that is a real consideration as well.<\/p> <p>  In many respects, one is looking at probably a higher level of equity coming in with a tillage conversion into dairying as opposed to a suckler or beef conversion, where there will be equity in the stock.  In reality, in terms of new entrants to dairy production and people who would have received quota under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine schemes, conversions from the beef and tillage sectors have been at the lower end of the numbers.  The most significant proportion of new entrants, if one wants to call them that, have come from the dairy sector.  They have had some level of dairy experience within the home or extended family farm, which has really seen them through.  Our experience of that has been quite positive. <\/p> <p>  To pick up on Deputy Penrose's question on dealing with young farmers coming into the industry and how we are supporting them, first and foremost, we have had a strong focus on the young farmer market for well over a decade.  Deputy Penrose cited the statistic that less than 7% of the farming population is a young farmer.  On trying to encourage and foster young farmers, we work very closely with Teagasc in its agriculture colleges on its level 6 and green certificate programmes.  We have a financial planning programme in place with Teagasc as part of its curriculum and every year, we run a best farm plan of the year award.  This has been really good for the bank in building financial acumen in future farmers and an understanding on the part of those farmers of what it is a bank will look for from them when they come to see us with their business plans and what a good plan looks like.  For the first time, this year the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise at Greenmount in Northern Ireland was part of the initiative as well.  It is a cross-Border initiative which is working very well.<\/p> <p>  When we are interacting on the ground through our branches and business centres and through direct banking with young farmers, as a prerequisite, any young farmer or new entrant to dairying will meet an agri-adviser.  For capacity reasons, that is not the case for all lending cases across the board in the bank.  We prioritise new entrants to the sector when arranging these meetings with the agri-advisers.  Specifically, we want to get an understanding of their experience and financial acumen.  How do we deal with them?  We give them interest-only periods, in recognition of the challenges in the start-up phase.  Typically, initially it starts with a one year interest-only period which is reviewed when necessary.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to bear in mind that while this is our first episode of volatility post-quota, realistically we have to bear 2009 and 2013 in mind as well in terms of the form that dairy farmers and the entire industry have in dealing with volatility.  Our view would be that dairy farmers and the industry itself are better positioned now.  We have a greater understanding of the impact of the cycle, be it the cycle related to price or a cycle related to weather, and dealing with it.  In terms of budgeting through the cycle and taking account of the volatility, we are comfortable with taking a long-term through-the-cycle budget milk price.  However, this is only one half of margin on a farm.  The other half is the cost base, which is very important for us as well.  While we keep the milk price under review, it is important that we carry out rigorous financial assessments of proposals in front of us and that we get an understanding of the cost base on the farm because this really makes a difference.  When one looks at the Teagasc profit monitors, the variance between different farms is quite frightening.  Mr. Burke alluded to this already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015112400002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1448373600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across Dr. Finnegan but 20 years ago, the price per litre of milk was 28 cent.

We run them in conjunction with Broadmore Research and Consulting, which is doing focus group sessions with young farmers to understand the key challenges they face in getting set up in business.  As a bank, we are going to try to embed some of those learnings into the offering we have for young farmers.  We will also make the report available widely, including to Macra na Feirme and Teagasc, so that we can understand the key challenges, not just financial challenges facing young farmers.  These challenges include relationships with older farmers and other family members as well, which is a key issue for young farmers.<\/p> <p>  Our central agriteam give a number of guest lectures in UCD and the Teagasc colleges.<\/p><p>Previously, we were sponsors of the Macra na Feirme national conference.<\/p><p> We give unsecured amounts for young trained farmers to get them started.  Many young farmers come home to farm the family farm business.  Sometimes they feel they are simply working there and cannot build up any business acumen themselves.  We can give a small number of unsecured facilities to young farmers.  Sometimes they take on or lease a block of land or carry out contract rearing of heifers for their fathers or other people.  This allows them to build up a reputation with the bank and they can then rely on that when they look to expand the business in future.<\/p><p> We introduced the pasture loan last year because we recognised that grass-based systems are the most competitive in the world.

The total allocation for my Department in 2015 is &euro;1.329 billion, of which &euro;834 million has been allocated to current expenditure programmes, while &euro;449 million has been allocated to capital programmes.<\/p><p>The total allocation for my Department in 2015 amounts to &euro;1.329 billion, with &euro;834 million allocated to current expenditure programmes and &euro;494 million allocated to capital programmes. To date in 2015, some &euro;847 million, or 64%, of the overall allocation has been spent, namely, &euro;647 million on the current side and &euro;200 million on the capital side.  The provision of more than &euro;1.3 billion to the Department for 2015 is firm evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  Department programmes are also benefiting in 2015 from resources available from both the local government and environment funds. <br\/><br\/>Turning to some specific areas in housing, 2015 has seen a very significant level of new investment in housing across a range of measures, which will increase the supply of homes to be made available.  In 2015 the housing programme accounts for 51% of the overall allocation for the Department.  The overall provision for housing increased by more than &euro;230 million since 2014, with capital funding having been increased significantly by &euro;160 million.  This investment is providing for significant expansion in social housing provision with a target of more than 15,900 housing units to be delivered in 2015 under a range of social housing initiatives.  More than 2,500 of these units are being delivered under the various capital programmes with more than 13,000 units targeted to be made available through the local authority leasing scheme, the rental accommodation scheme and the housing assistance payment scheme. <br\/><br\/>Social housing continues to be a top priority for the Government and my Department and this is evidenced by the additional funding recently announced in budget 2016.  In overall terms, housing spend by my Department will increase by 18%, from &euro;686 million in 2015 to &euro;811 million next year.  An additional &euro;56 million will be made available for capital programmes and a &euro;69 million increase in current spending.  In addition, &euro;112 million will be provided directly by local authorities, bringing the total housing provision in 2016 to &euro;923 million.  This provision will support the delivery of more than 17,000 new units in 2016. <br\/><br\/>In the area of local government, the Local Government Fund has undergone significant change in recent years.  While motor tax continues to be paid into the fund, local property tax, collected by the Revenue Commissioners, is now also coming into the fund.  The year we have seen the ending of the general purpose grant payments and the introduction of the local property tax being paid to local authorities through the fund.  <br\/><br\/>Some 80% of the local property tax revenue is being retained locally to fund vital public services.  The remaining 20% is redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the country.  These measures are necessary to create a balanced system of funding across local authorities.  The Government has devolved more powers to local authorities in recent years by giving elected members discretion to vary the rates of local property tax by up to 15%.  This allows for greater transparency and accountability at a local level.  Some 14 local authorities lowered their basic local property tax rate for 2015. <br\/><br\/>The income sources to the Local Government Fund this year are estimated to be motor tax of &euro;1.167 billion, local property tax of &euro;440 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;233 million.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;1.839 billion from the fund in 2015, including local property tax payments to local authorities of &euro;459 million, payment of &euro;364 million for the maintenance of non-national roads to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and a payment to the Exchequer of up to &euro;484 million. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>With respect to water services, &euro;399 million is being provided from the Local Government Fund to Irish Water in 2015 in respect of operational subvention.  This is funding the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water, which is being provided to all children in the State along with the cost of capping domestic water charges at the levels set out in the Water Services Act 2014.  To date, some &euro;297 million has been paid to Irish Water in 2015 from the Local Government Fund.  <br\/><br\/>The 2015 Estimate for my Department also contains an allocation of &euro;130 million for the new water conservation grant.  The estimated level of demand for 2015 took account of the number of primary residences recorded in 2011 Census of Population as well as experiences with other demand-led schemes.  It is expected that the final outturn in respect of the grant, including administrative costs, will amount to some &euro;97 million. <br\/><br\/>The Government remains committed to supporting the group water sector as a very important element of the water industry in Ireland.  This was reflected in the provision of &euro;17.5 million in 2015 for my Department&rsquo;s rural water programme, under which funding is provided for group water schemes. <br\/><br\/>The environment and waste management programme provides for expenditure of &euro;35 million in 2015, largely to meet the cost of the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency, including the work of the former Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which was merged successfully with the agency in 2014.<\/p><p>The environment fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, provides a further &euro;44 million to be directed to key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention and recycling.<\/p><p> The Leader elements of the rural development programme provide for voted expenditure of &euro;45 million in 2015.  Up to &euro;30 million of this is to meet the outstanding commitments under the 2007-2013 programme, which has been successful with over 9,000 projects receiving funding.  Financial support has been provided to over 8,000 enterprises and over 4,000 full-time jobs have been created.  In addition, provision of &euro;15 million was made for the new 2014-2020 Leader programme, which will build on the previous programme&rsquo;s success in creating new and innovative opportunities for rural businesses and communities.<\/p><p> The Vote provides funding for the local and community development programme, LCDP, which concluded in March and for its successor, the social and community activation programme, SICAP, which was rolled out from April.  SICAP takes account of the new alignment of local development and local government in its objectives and delivery.  In particular, SICAP is being managed and implemented through the new local community development committees, as the new governance model for local and community programmes in each local authority area.  The allocation of over &euro;45 million for 2015 to cover the funding requirements of both LCDP and SICAP, as well as related supports, has allowed further good progress to be made in this vital area.  I expect the 2015 allocations will be fully spent by year end.<\/p><p> As I outlined earlier, 64% of the Department&rsquo;s overall allocation for 2015 has been spent to date.  I expect significant further expenditure to take place by the end of 2015.  Traditionally, a significant proportion of the Department&rsquo;s capital spend takes place in the final months of the year.  Where savings emerge in the finalisation of departmental spending in 2015, consideration will be given, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the appropriate use of the resources concerned.  I expect to meet any additional requirements in 2015 from within existing departmental allocations without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible to allow members an opportunity to discuss both the activities of the Department and how our programmes and significant resources are being deployed in 2015 in greater detail.  Those programmes are benefiting communities and citizens across the country, making the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery and helping the less well-off in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#D00800","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

What will not be spent and under what headings before the end of the year?<\/p> <p>  The area of housing accounts for 51% of the overall allocation for the Department.  It is pretty difficult to scrutinise this when one is only counting one part of the equation and when the other side is covered by a different committee.  That concerns the amount of moneys allocated through rent supplement and increased rent supplement.  We have a housing crisis that was predictable.  In fact, this committee debated it and more or less drew attention to it several years ago.  The scale of the crisis is out of proportion to the amounts available in the budget.  Does the Minister have an estimate of what is necessary to deal with scale of the housing crisis?<\/p><p>Does he believe the response is in proportion to that?  Much of the money is being allocated on the current side rather than on the capital side on matters such as housing assistance payments.  Essentially, they represent a residual payment as opposed to a permanent response.  The local authorities are allocating &euro;112 million directly.  From what budget is that coming?  Is that on the capital or current side?<\/p><p> On local government funding, the general-purpose grant is being dispensed with.  That, of course, was the mechanism for funding local authorities in advance of the introduction of the local property tax.  Essentially, the property tax is a replacement tax rather than an additional tax.  Some 80% is retained by the local authorities and 14 local authorities reduced their local property tax.  Some counties are net contributors and others are net recipients.  If a net recipient is capable of reducing its local property tax, is that factored into the equation for the following year?<\/p><p> The Minister said the lower property tax base is the reason for determining the 20%.  Is there any evaluation of the level of services local authorities are capable of providing?  For example, the needs and resources model used to be the model for determining if there was buoyancy in the general-purpose fund.  There are huge differences in the ratios for staff in different parts of the country.  It is pretty difficult to catch up, particularly in growing areas, without factoring that in.  Will the Minister address that issue?<\/p><p> The Minister said that the &euro;399 million provided from the local government fund to Irish Water in 2015 relates specifically to the free water for children along with the capping of domestic charges.  Will the Minister give us the breakdown of costs, specifically regarding the provisions for children?  Further to the &euro;100 grant for conservation, has the Department completed any analysis or measurement of conservation or is there any intention to have such a measurement?  Should it be called conservation if it is not possible to measure it?<\/p><p> Money was provided on the capital side for housing outputs.

We have provided funding to literally fill the void.  We have used it to turn around more voids which means that we have supplemented one for the other, which is a good and quick way to deal with the matter.  The Deputy has spoken about voids on numerous occasions and I am glad to say we have increased their output.  There is an extra spend in dealing with the problem of homelessness, of which I am sure the Deputy will approve.  We are very confident that there will be very little that will remain unspent, if any, in the housing capital budget because we have concentrated on the issue quite a bit.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some housing statistics and information because many Deputies and Senators will have questions on the topic.  In 2014, the number of new building acquisitions was 285 units.  This is the first year of the strategy and we will triple the figure to about 950 units.  The Deputy specifically wanted to know the number of builds that would be generated under the strategy.  There will be in excess of 200, but the figure will increase on a yearly basis.  In the first year of the strategy we have approved local authority building projects and voluntary housing investments to the tune of about &euro;500 million to provide some 3,000 units.  Further approvals will be finalised in the weeks ahead.  It makes more sense to buy rather than to build in some parts of the country because there is excess housing stock and it represents better value.  <\/p> <p>  We have made major progress in the roll-out of the HAP scheme, with over 5,000 households being supported across 18 local authorities.  As the scheme is rolled out and more people avail of it, there will be even greater success.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned leasing in substitution for voids.  We have done a huge amount of work on voids and there is more to be done.  Last year we turned around 2,300 voids and expect to turn around 2,500 by the end of the year.  I have met many local authorities, particularly those in Dublin.  I wish to make it clear that whatever funding is required to turn around voids to provide social housing units as quickly as possible will be provided.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and I both believe such an initiative is the quickest way to provide housing. <\/p> <p>  We have taken a number of other measures to increase supply.  A package of measures to deal with supply in the rental sector has been announced in the past couple of weeks.  We have also provided a substantial amount of extra funding to tackle the problem of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether local authorities used their own resources.<\/p><p>It is estimated that &euro;119 million is being used by local authorities from their own resources.  <\/p><p> The Deputy has asked about other areas in which there has been an underspend.  We expect an underspend under the Leader programme because of the way it will kick off.  <\/p><p> I have been asked me how much money will be required to provide housing in the years to come.  The &euro;4 billion provided for in the social housing strategy is, by and large, what will be required in coming years to address the issues of which we are all aware.  I am delighted with the current amount we can project over the required number of years to address social housing issues.  We have serious issues with social housing unit numbers, social housing lists and how they are defined.  Next year will be the first when we will have a fully verified number for those who are actually on housing waiting lists, which will be quite helpful.  We have put in place a comprehensive strategy with funding amounting to &euro;4 billion.  It is a strategy my Department is determined to fulfil and deliver for those most in need of housing.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked for a breakdown of the figure of &euro;399 million.  In 2015 there is &euro;60 million for the child allowance; the capping cost is &euro;129 million, while there is a subsidy of &euro;211 million.  <\/p><p> The Deputy asked me to define the term \"water conservation grant\".  Of course, payment of the grant is not contingent on people stating a purpose for which it shall be used.  Detailed information has been provided on what we believe it should be used for, whether it be for wells, water butts, desludging septic tanks or many other efficiency and environmentally friendly measures.  I have noticed that a phenomenal volume of new technologies are emerging via SMEs and small companies.  Such technologies will be replicated in other jurisdictions in years to come.  However, what happens in the first year of the programme will need to be evaluated to see where and how the funding was spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#H00600","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":153,"content":"<p>How can one evaluate it if there is no link with conservation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#J00200","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to give us a chance because we are only in the first year of the programme.

We expect the the figure to be slightly lower this year, but we will reach the target in the first six or seven weeks of 2016.  We are putting HAP scheme funds into the voids programme, as the Minister outlined.  We have far exceeded the targets set, for which credit is due to the local authorities.  We asked them to step up to the mark to deal with voids and they did.  As a result, we expect over 2,500 voids to be turned around this year.  They are the most logical and obvious place in which to invest because we need to bring existing housing stock back into beneficial use as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  On acquisitions in some local authority areas, as the Minister said, it represents better value for money for taxpayers to buy rather than build houses.  We expect over 750 social housing units to be delivered through direct acquisition by year end.  They will be ready for immediate occupation once the acquisitions have been completed.  Building projects are also under way.<\/p> <p>  We have been asked how much it will cost to resolve the crisis.<\/p><p>I want to make it quite clear that it is not just about the money.  Money is being provided and obviously resources and funding are very important, but there are other issues also, especially in the private sector in which there is a very dysfunctional market which affects the entire housing sector.  There are issues within local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Over 3,000 units have been approved by the Department and there is funding to deliver these units, but there is a process by which they will be occupied.  Planning under Part 8 by the various local authorities must be gone through and builders must then be procured through the tender processes before building can take place.  There is a time lag between approval and actual allocation and occupation of units.  All resources are being put into and efforts made by the Department and local authorities to prioritise this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#J00600","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome and thank the Minister and the Ministers of State.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to actual measurement of performance, it must be asked if it is up to us, as legislators, to draw up the measurements to be used?  When one looks at performance Europe-wide, Ireland does not rate well.  However, if Ireland was to be rated on its performance since 2010, the performance level would read very differently in that it would be a higher and better percentage.<\/p> <p>  An overall allocation of 51% for housing represents a figure of more than &euro;230 million, which is to be welcomed.  I congratulate the Minister on the priorities he has set.  There are 15,900 units to be provided in 2015.  That is a big difference from the time I was on the council in the years before I entered the House.  There was no social housing being provided and the system in operation did not work, perhaps through no fault of the local authorities.  I hope, therefore, that this new funding and the priority being given to the programme will help to make it work now.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the local authorities' spend on housing.  I understand some local authorities perform better than others.  I know that Deputy Jerry Buttimer tabled a question last week about how the council was performing in Cork city versus Cork county in terms of the moneys being spent.  Will the Minister clarify if the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has a benchmark for each local authority to see how it is performing and who is the best boy or girl in the class?  Where is the rap on the knuckles?  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, has congratulated the local authorities on their voids programmes, on which I also congratulate them.  In my area South Dublin County Council has really stepped up to the mark in making voids available, but there is more scope with this programme.  It was pointed out to me by a local councillor in County Roscommon recently that two rural houses owned by the county council were falling apart because it was too expensive to renovate them.  The council would use nearly all of its money for voids if it was to be spent on these two properties.  However, there are developers who are ready and willing to take them over and perhaps lease them back through the HAP scheme to the local authorities.  More should be done in that regard.I will supply further information on the matter to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  We hear criticisms all the time from Senators about the allocations from the local property tax, motor tax and general purpose funds.  It could be beneficial, therefore, to see a graph showing what was given from them in the past five years to be compared with what is being done now.  <\/p> <p>  I take issue with the Minister when he says the Government has devolved more powers to local authorities.  I have analysed the powers devolved from full councils to district councils and also from central government to local government.  They are minimal.  I have them on paper and will forward the list to the Minister of State.  I have conducted my analysis of what I term new local reserved functions.

The Senator raised the issue of local authorities.  I outlined where the Government stands on spending in this area.  Much of the drawdown for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government comes towards the year end but this year it is even further ahead on spending than previous years.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Paudie Coffey and Ann Phelan, and I have been constantly monitoring and managing the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  For the benefit of the committee I will outline a baseline of where the local authorities were.  Local authorities were simply not in a position to deal with building houses and providing social housing, in the way that was required, up until this year.  That is why I have provided more than 300 staff, most of whom are already in this space.  It took a bit of time to ensure this staffing complement was ramped up to the level required.  We needed to go through a process on that to ensure that local authorities were facing in the direction of building houses to the scale that is needed.  That is why the spend at this level is higher this year than it has been for a number of years.  The Department also wants to make sure that all local authorities do spend.  It would be wrong for me to say that all local authorities are presenting at the same level.  Some local authorities have embraced the delivery of housing at a different level from others and I congratulate them.  Some ramped it up quicker than others while not all at the same level.  However, they are at the space now where they have positioned themselves to deliver the &euro;4 billion strategy which was announced this time last year.<\/p> <p>  Senator Keane asked about the measurement of local authorities and whether the Department maintains tables on their performance.  By and large, yes.  Checks and balances are being put in place all the time to ensure that local authorities are monitored in great detail across all areas of housing spend and delivery.  A particular eye is kept on those areas that are key priorities for the Department, particularly the key urban areas.  However, if some local authorities are coming to year end and if they have been very diligent in spending all their money, then the Department will look at further funds for them if necessary because their delivery rate is so impressive.  With voids, for example, which are social housing units that are boarded up, some local authorities have been able to turn them around a lot quicker than others.  I congratulate those that have done so; we need to create a standardisation across the local authorities on the issue of voids.  I would not like to see a continuation of the slower timelines of turnaround.  We want to create an expectation and a standard by which voids will be turned around to ensure they will not be left vacant for a long period of time.<\/p> <p>  The Department also has a number of other measurements - which are not just financially based - by which it measures, for example, the length of time houses are vacant between occupancies.  We also measure the amount of refusals for social housing offerings.<\/p><p>That can be more than 40% in some local authorities, which is a matter of concern.  Where that happens, it means the units are left vacant for longer because the prospective tenants are turning them down.  The movement to choice-based lettings, of which we are advocates, will help to address that.<\/p><p> I am aware of the Senator's concerns regarding Roscommon.  Others have also raised concerns.  We are examining them.  The housing needs assessment will be done next year and from then on it will be carried out every year by the Housing Agency.  That is a critical issue because we need to ensure we have consistency on housing numbers and those who have social housing requirements in years to come.  We can then compare apples with apples and oranges with oranges.  For example, there were figures in respect of the number of people in Cork who needed social housing.  There was then a choice-based analysis involving communicating with those who where on the list.  The figures differed substantially.  That shows that the analysis needs to be done every year and not every three or four years so that we can keep on top of it.<\/p><p> The Senator asked a specific question on rural water schemes.  I have met representatives of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes on a number of occasions and I addressed that body's conference this year.  The federation's main request was for a multi-annual funding approach which we have addressed.  There are many legacy issues which we are trying to resolve.  We have a priority-based system involving the local authorities.  Through that priority-based system, we are allocating the funding as we can.  We are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - I think this is what the Senator is referring to - on a number of legacy issues which date back some time and which may go beyond the scope or scale of the traditional funding to group water schemes.  Significant legacy issues need to be dealt with in certain parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#L00400","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I will give some further information on HAP which will be of interest to the committee members.  Of the 31 local authorities, 18 are now administering the housing assistance payment scheme.  We are extending that by taking three or four local authorities at a time.  Obviously, training and resourcing are needed.  At the current rate, between 150 and 200 housing applicants are transferring into the HAP scheme per week.  Even at the current rate, without extending the scheme as we intend to do, we will comfortably meet the 10,000 target for the HAP scheme for 2016.  It is working quite well in those local authorities, but the intention is to extend it further.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised an important question on voids.  Some local authorities have existing housing stock not categorised as void and rather almost categorised as derelict, having gone beyond the normal interventions to turn a void around.  We are planning on making further provision in 2016 under our remedial works and regeneration schemes to address that stock.  There will be measurement indicators.  We will ask local authorities to come back in terms of maintenance of stock.  Some local authorities are better than others.  Some maintain their existing stock very well and there is no need for large-scale investment in derelict or regeneration programmes.  However, others have neglected maintenance programmes in their housing stock and we want to see that improved.  We are now providing the funding to get that stock back into use.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate a worrying statistic.  In the case of some local authorities with quite substantial housing waiting lists, more than 40% of people are refusing the offer of a house.  We must recognise the underlying problems in this regard.  It is not just about the house; there may be anti-social issues in an estate, etc.  It behoves all of us, including the local authorities and the Department, to identify and address those problems.  That refusal rate is too high and we need to see those houses being taken up.  Choice-based letting is one way to address it but there is also a need for interventions by local authorities to improve estates so that people want to move into those houses.<\/p><p>We recognise those challenges and we want to fund and resource local authorities to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#M00200","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Senator that we have set up a working group on the rural water issues.

We can do that in writing to the Minister and expect him to respond accordingly.<\/p> <p>  It is the first anniversary of the Minister's announcement of &euro;4 billion for social housing.  Within that plan, was it envisaged that only 200 units would be built in the year since then?  Will the &euro;30,000 cap on repairing voiding units be lifted?  Will local authorities have local discretion to carry out the required work to turn around those houses more quickly than heretofore?  At present, irrespective of whether the fault lies at the door of the local authority or the Department, it is taking in some cases &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 worth of work to be done to a house.  People are left waiting while only 64% of the budget has been spent at this stage of the year which is not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I welcome last week's announcement of the proposed tenant purchase scheme.  I have been calling for a new version of the scheme since it was abandoned in 2013.  It has many worthwhile aspects, on which I commend the Minister.  Will the funds raised locally be retained locally as an incentive for local authorities to reinvest in their housing stock or to enter into agreements to provide more housing units for those on the housing waiting lists?<\/p> <p>  On the provision of new units, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, was in Banagher, County Offaly, a few weeks ago - we were glad to see eight houses built after four years.  Notwithstanding that, the cost associated with it was &euro;2.2 million for eight units.  I am more than delighted that people have been accommodated in a county where the list extends to 2,000.  Having said that, it works out at &euro;275,000 per unit.  How does that wash with the public when we consider that Project Arrow is being sold to private investors for supposedly &euro;1 billion, 50% of them residential?  This would indicate &euro;500 million worth of residential units throughout the country can be purchased for approximately &euro;100,000 per unit.  Those units are finished and ready for people to be housed in.<\/p><p>Is the Minister not disappointed that the Government has not given serious consideration to a better return on our investment in respect of the social dividend that one expected from NAMA?<\/p><p> Local authorities throughout the country are finalising and preparing budgets for the forthcoming year but they were informed in recent weeks of a global evaluation in respect of utilities, which results in a reduction in income in the forthcoming year for many.  In my county yesterday the Department gave a rebate to meet that extra cost.  The loss is &euro;440,000 and the Department reimbursed &euro;227,000 and said it was a one-off payment which would not be repeated next year and the council should make provision as re-evaluation continues, although I think only 25% of the total re-evaluation has taken place.  The reimbursement to local authorities was somewhat selective.  In Offaly, for example, it amounted to little less than 50% while in Kilkenny I believe it was 100%.  Why is there discretion between counties?  My county of Offaly is very dependent on the utilities such as Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  If the decision taken recently by the courts in Edenderry were to be replicated we would be at a loss of &euro;1.7 million in rates income.  How could we compensate for that?  The Minister says that only 64% of the budget has been spent.  There are areas that have yet to be allocated towards the end of the year.  Will there be further allocations to those counties that have been short-changed? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#N01300","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>It is the anniversary of the social housing strategy and I have confidence in that strategy.  We will provide 946 units this year because we have to take into account acquisition and building.  In many parts of the country, dare I say in some midlands areas, which Deputy Cowen and I represent, it makes more sense to buy where there are vacant properties and we are not able to supply, than to build.  The Deputy asked about the cap as he has asked before.  The &euro;30,000 cap is required but many local authorities come in under that.  They are required to maintain their stock.  They can supplement the funding with their own resources and many do if they need to go over the cap.  Voids in different areas, even within one local authority jurisdiction, can cost different amounts.  They are a contribution to the local authorities to maintain their stock rather than a continuous payment to maintain it.  The local authorities are expected to maintain their stock.  They use their own resources and we give them up to &euro;30,000 to be able to do so.  Some do it very well, some less well.  Some are turning around an incredible volume of voids, particularly in Dublin city, where there have been 800.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has asked on numerous occasions about the tenant purchase scheme and I was glad to be able to put together a plan to bring it about.

The local authorities have to do that themselves.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned eight units in his constituency.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is more familiar with this than I because he was there and looked at them.  My information is that this was a case of the local authority doing something as a prototype.  It was energy efficient passive housing, which we have heard a lot about of late.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s analysis of the costs but it was doing this as a prototype or sample scheme.  It wants to see if there are long-term savings from a bigger outlay at the beginning.  Sometimes we blame local authorities for not thinking outside the box but in some cases we should give them a chance.  I like the fact it is being proactive and I would like to see local authorities being even more proactive.<\/p> <p>  By the end of quarter three of 2015, 2,526 of 6,574 units identified by NAMA as potentially suitable have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing.  Completed housing unit transfers to date stand at 1,241, together with a further 359 which have been contracted and where completion work is under way.  This brings the total delivery of social housing from the NAMA portfolio, either completed or in the process of being done, to approximately 1,600.<\/p> <p>  I take the point in respect of the valuation issue.  I do not have specific information on the Deputy&rsquo;s local authority.  I did not go into the detail.  There was detailed engagement between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and each local authority on this issue last week.  Everyone knew this valuation was coming but the timing of it was an issue.  It was in the middle of the budgetary process.  We considered how we could deal with that and ensure that local authorities over the coming year would not be at a loss.  In the valuation of the ESB and other utilities, one side went up and the other went down.  It differed across all local authorities and as a consequence, some local authorities were hit, including the one in the Deputy&rsquo;s area.  We agreed to supplement that but I will give the Deputy a separate note on his local authority because I do not have that detail here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#P00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister to clarify that so that there will be no ambiguity because the cost to the local authorities went up in both in the instances I have given.

There is a variance in cost per unit of turning around vacant houses right across the various local authorities ranging from &euro;15,000 per unit to &euro;40,000.  We have to be very careful not to reward local authorities who are neglecting to maintain stock.  If the cap of &euro;30,000 is lifted the danger is that we will reward those local authorities that are not investing adequately in the annual maintenance budgets of their stock.  As I said earlier it is important to acknowledge that some stock has gone beyond the normal void turnaround.  This could be called a derelict tier.  The Department is looking at putting in place funding to bring those back into beneficial use.  They will cost in excess of &euro;30,000 per unit.  We will be asking local authorities to come forward with their proposals on a once off basis to get them back into use and after that they will be expected to maintain them in the normal way.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the eight units in Banagher, County Offaly, which the Deputy welcomed, costs were associated with the site in terms of enabling works.  The units are in the middle of the town and were a regeneration project.  In addition they are passive units so they have a much higher spec than the normal unit and the Department was willing to fund them.  We will monitor them over time in terms of energy efficiency and all the other benefits expected from passive housing.  The Department believes there should be flexibility in terms of specifications, that one should not tie down a high spec because it brings into question the issue of viability, as we have seen recently with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  If there is a high spec on delivery of units there are viability issues in terms of the cost of delivering those units.

It is not available to me.  It has not been sent to my office.  In respect of the Estimates, there is an increase in the capital budget for housing on what was set out in programme expenditure, of &euro;47 million which would provide for 280 units.  On relets, I was interested to hear one of the answers or a suggestion made in that regard.  Where houses are vacant - I appreciate that some are in a state of dereliction - is the option of having private contractors refurbishing them, taking them over and leasing them back to the council being considered?  If so, that would be damaging in the long term.  I can understand getting quotations from private contractors when the house is refurbished to be relet by the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that issue.  Up to a few months ago, if a house was abandoned, the local authority was in a position within a number of weeks to repossess and relet it before it deteriorated and before too much damage was done to it.  Local authorities now have to advertise in the local press on a number of occasions that the house is vacant and are paying thousands of euro for such advertisements.  If somebody comes along and wrecks the house, it is taking the house out of use for a longer period, there are more costs involved in refurbishing it and more work has to be done on it.  I am aware the Minister passes through the constituency regularly, and is seen around regularly these days, so I can show him examples of where this is happening.  I am very concerned about this issue as everybody wants these houses occupied.  This puts a greater cost on the Department and on the local authority.  The Government says it wants relets speeded up, which is what we all want.  That is good for everybody, including tenants, councillors and so on.  However, the problem is that this has slowed down the process and placed a huge burden, not least an advertising burden, on local authorities and further repairs need to be carried out.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the refusal of allocations, it is unfortunate that is happening.  Those of us who have come through the local authority system know the reason that is happening in most cases.  It is because some local authority estates or parts of local authority estates are controlled by little gangs of bullies.  I mention the legislation and the resources available to the local authorities to try to deal with estates and the tenant liaison officers.  This is a serious issue.<\/p><p>When genuinely good families who are on the waiting list and who want to move into a home are allocated a house, they have a week or ten days to make a decision.  After great soul searching, they sometimes turn the offer down.  They do not want to turn it down but they do so because of what is happening.  That must be examined.  Again, there is a huge cost because, as the Minister pointed out earlier, the house is left vacant for a longer period.  The resources of the tenant liaison officer, the powers of the local authorities and the co-operation of the Garda must be beefed up.<\/p><p> Did the Minister say there were 230 local authority houses completed in the first 11 months of this year and there were 700 purchases made to date by the local authorities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#R00300","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, the Ministers of State and their team.

As we have very little time, I will focus on that topic.  There is no evidence that social housing is a top priority.  The Minister's figures are constantly shifting.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify the spending figures.  I have all of the data with me on the number of new social houses that are being produced.  The Minister said there has been increased capital funding of &euro;160 million for this year.  The total capital spend on housing for the year, according to the Estimates, is &euro;376 million.  According to the Department's figures published on 19 November - the Anti-Austerity Alliance quoted the Minister's figures a couple of weeks ago and we were told they were out of date so these are five days old - the last time that public capital expenditure on housing was that low was 1994.  The Minister is spending less money on social housing than the last and previous Governments did.  We must go back 20 years to find a lower figure.  The Minister is shaking his head but I will happily read out the figures or give them to him if he does not believe me.  They are on the Department's website for all to see.  They are under the heading \"Public Capital Expenditure on Housing\".<\/p> <p>  In 1994, a sum of &pound;353.9 million was spent, which is slightly lower than what the Minister is spending now.  In 2008, when the recession started, more money was spent on social housing than the Minister is spending now.  Only this Government has reduced the figure and not increased it.  In 2008, a total of &euro;2,303.2 million was spent in capital expenditure.  That is far more than is being spent now, when one considers that the housing crisis has really emerged in the last couple of years.  The Minister constantly claims that he is spending more than anybody before him spent, but the figures do not stack up.  Can we clarify the Minister's latest claims?<\/p> <p>  I have the Department's figures for new social housing output.  They are five days old.  New social housing output for Q2 in 2015 shows 324 houses or apartments in progress and completions of 157.<\/p><p>Basically, between completions, acquisitions and voluntary housing, there will be only 403 new houses or units by the end of this year.  With another 324 in progress, there will be 727 new units with a month left to the end of the year.  Where is all the housing the Minister talks about?<\/p><p> Last March, in answer to a written parliamentary question on local authority housing provision, in a breakdown of social housing the Minister stated that 1,400 houses would be built, with 440 for special needs.  Are they included in the figures or are they still coming on stream?  He also mentioned 55 Traveller-specific units.  Again, are they included in the figures or are they still coming on stream?  I see where Deputy Stanley is coming from but all we can go on is what the Department puts on the website as outputs every quarter, not what the Minister claims in a press release or an announcement.  We can only go on what has been physically produced.<\/p><p> The number of houses is very low and this is a huge disappointment for people.  The Minister claims that we like it when people are wallowing in misery.  We are the people who are dealing with the misery every day on our doorsteps.  Other Deputies are in the same position.  We are inundated with people who are homeless and living in the misery that has been created over a few years.  I do not blame it all on the current Government, but its claims that it is doing more than any Government did previously are utterly wrong.  Less is being spent on social housing now than was spent under many previous Governments.  If there are other figures we will listen to them, but I have gone to the trouble of digging them out and bringing them here.<\/p><p> I am confused because many announcements are being made.  The only figures we can use are the Department's figures for voluntary housing and council housing.  A total of 20 council houses were built in the first two quarters of the year.  It went from 20 to a big fat zero in the second quarter.  Does the Minister acknowledge that is the case?  He said it would multiply by ten by the end of the year, so there must be some acceleration taking place in the councils to produce them in the next six weeks.  If that was the case we would all be delighted.  How can the Minister continue to make these claims when none of the figures backs him up in any way?  Has he abandoned previous targets?  Even with these targets he is only meeting half of what he said.  He said 1,400 in March, but there will be only 700.  He is producing half of the number of houses he promised, and even 1,400 would have been way below what is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#S00300","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on the housing issue and clarify what might be called the war of the figures with regard to the social housing crisis.  It is not the Chairman's fault, and I am not sure where the responsibility lies, but we do not have enough time to do what we should be doing here.  There must be a forensic analysis of these figures.  If the OECD has condemned the Oireachtas, quite correctly, for a spectacular failure in measuring outputs against Estimates and so forth and if we are promising we will do something about that, this is not a good example.  We have an hour and a quarter to deal with the outputs for the money spent.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point, because the topic we are dealing with here is Estimates and outputs.<\/p><p>What we are engaged in is not satisfactory and not serious budget scrutiny.<\/p><p> Where are the figures which we certainly need for the numbers of new applicants on local authority housing lists this year?  All of the figures the Minister has given us are meaningless or, at least, seriously deficient when it comes to forming a true picture of what is happening in dealing with the housing issue.  The data serve no purpose unless all estimates, projections and outputs are set against the numbers of new applicants.  If we had these figures, I am confident they would show there will be more people on the housing lists at the end of this year than there were at the beginning of it.  To give an example, 100 people are joining the housing list in D&uacute;n Laoghaire every month, which amounts to 1,200 in a year, but D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council delivered zero houses last year.  The numbers are pitiful everywhere else.  We cannot get a real sense of whether we are beginning even to make an impact on the catastrophic housing lists unless we are able to measure the data against the numbers of new applicants this year.  I am asking the Minister for a commitment that we will get these figures.  If he does not have them now, will he give them to us soon?  It should be part of his brief to contact every local authority in the country to find out how many new applicants they have had on a month by month basis.<\/p><p> Will the Minister accept that the targets he has set for 2015 completely misrepresent the plan to deal with the social housing emergency?  What I mean by this is that his target for 2015 was 15,925 under all categories, namely, acquisition, construction, capital assistance, regeneration, voids, vacant units, leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment scheme and so on.  However, there is a large distinction between long-term leasing, the RAS and HAP schemes, all of which are dependent on the private sector and most of which do not actually involve the provision of new accommodation for those on the lists.  I do not see how the Minister can deliver on the targets he has set in this regard, given that he has failed spectacularly to do so thus far.  However, even if he does deliver, does he accept that none of it involves new accommodation?  In fact, it is simply a case of recategorising people who are already in rented accommodation as being housed.  There is no new social housing; people will remain in the private housing they have been in all along, but they will now be counted under a different category.<\/p><p> If we are to have any meaningful assessment of the level of delivery of new social housing, we should only be talking about construction, acquisition, capital assistance and regeneration projects.  In fact, regeneration projects do not provide new accommodation, nor does the restoration of voids and vacant properties.  The only meaningful figures are those which concern construction, acquisition and the capital assistance scheme.  The Minister's targets were 946 units for construction and 440 for capital assistance.  I understand the number to be delivered under the construction heading is 422 units, although the Minister might be able to give an update on that figure, and 157 under the capital assistance scheme.  In other words, less than half the target figure has been delivered.  The Minister is saying he will meet the targets and in one case exceed them.  How does he propose to achieve this, given that we are less than two months from the end of the year?<\/p><p>Even if the Minister does meet those targets, we are talking about only 1,300 new social housing units against a background where, according to my estimation, some 15,000 new applicants will have come onto the list by year end.  In other words, we are effectively going backwards.<\/p><p> The Minister said local authorities may use revenues from the local property tax as they see fit.  Will he explain how D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has &euro;10 million allocated for social housing for 2015 from the local property tax but is not allowed to spend that money because it is apparently \"awaiting instructions\" from the Minister and has been for the past year?  That is according to the management of the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#T00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy source that reference for me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#V00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I certainly will.

Deputies Coppinger and Boyd Barrett referred to a figure given last March of 1,400 units for delivery in 2015.  That figure relates to council leasing and voluntary housing and it has not changed.  We still expect to deliver more than 946 local authority builds and acquisitions and in excess of 440 voluntary housing units.  The spend in respect of 2015 was &euro;670 million and &euro;119 million, which gives a total of &euro;794 million.  The spend for 2016 will be &euro;811 million and &euro;112 million, which is a total of &euro;923 million.  That is the volume of funding we are putting into housing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies asked specific questions about targets.  Deputy Boyd Barrett was not here when I explained why we sometimes acquire instead of construct.  For 2015, our target in regard to local authority construction and acquisition, which we expect to meet, is 946 units, comprising in excess of 200 build units and 750 odd acquisitions.  The Deputy asked about local authority trurnarounds.  That activity does need to be ramped up, as I have acknowledged on previous occasions.  We have put more than 300 new staff into councils.  If local authorities have any further issues to raise with me, I have no problem dealing with them.  As I said, councils, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, may use local property tax revenues to address housing issues.  The Deputy asked about instructions from me to that authority.  Certainly, discussions and instructions are ongoing at this time.<\/p> <p>  We expect to deliver 440 units under the capital assistance programme, 150 under regeneration and remedial works, and more than 1,000 in the area of restoration of voids.

I am sure all members will welcome such developments because of the quick turnaround involved, plus the fact that the units are new.  Projected total output on the capital side is in excess of 4,036 units.<\/p> <p>  On social housing expenditure, including leasing and the RAS, we expect to deliver well in excess of 3,000 units.  Under the housing assistance payment scheme, we expect to deliver well in excess of 7,000 units and that figure to be ramped up early next year.  If one adds all of these figures, one will arrive at a total of 15,900 units.  I have outlined the targets set and projected outcomes in 2015.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked about the spend of 62%, the highest amount spent on housing for many years.  We have demanded that local authorities deliver on what we have asked them to do and the same applies to assisted housing bodies, AHBs, and everyone else who works in this area.  We are constantly on their case.  Our targets for 2016 are well in excess of those set for 2015.  <\/p> <p>  Overall, with regard to current delivery mechanisms, including the RAS and leasing, we have come in under target.  We aim to make up the bulk of the under-provision through the turnaround of additional voids on the capital side.  We have decided to do this because we accept that there are issues with the rental market and that leasing is difficult in parts of the country.  Therefore, we have concentrated more on voids on the capital side.<\/p> <p>  The remaining scheme is the HAP.  Every effort is being made to meet the targets set.  If we achieve a little less, we are confident that in the early weeks of next year we will be able to supplement the figure and deal with the matter because there are between 150 and 200 new cases a week.  I expect that figure to rise as the scheme is rolled out.

The Government and the Department are committed to funding and will continue to fund pyrite remediation projects where approvals are made. <\/p> <p>  On the overall debate on the provision of housing, a question was asked about the role of NAMA and its contribution.  NAMA identified in excess of 6,500 housing units which could be used for social housing.  Demand was confirmed by local authorities for more than 2,500 units, of which more than 1,600 have been delivered.  There is ongoing engagement between NAMA and local authorities to finalise further deals and contracts for the remaining number of units that have been confirmed as being needed, that is, approximately 1,000 units.  NAMA is making a substantial contribution to social housing provision and engagement will continue in the regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#Y00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Two questions I asked were not answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#Y00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Which two questions were not answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#Y00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The first was related to private contractors.

Specifically, it relates to the unprecedented and increasing number of homeless families who are presenting - particularly in the Dublin area - with consequential disruptive effects on family life and on the health and well-being of the children in particular.<\/p><p>To put this in context, of the 637 families currently homeless in the Dublin region, 401, consisting of 534 adults and 843 children, are being accommodated in unsuitable arrangements in hotels.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is extremely concerned about this increasing phenomenon; the situation that the new capacity being created by various housing solutions currently being implemented is not sufficient to accommodate the numbers now presenting; and, the consequential urgent need to accelerate the provision of housing to address the accommodations needs of homeless households, and especially homeless families, in the region.<\/p><p>To help address this issue, the Government has approved a comprehensive programme of measures including the initial delivery of 500 modular housing units for the Dublin region.  The purpose of this programme of measures is to help reduce the number of homeless families in hotels by providing more appropriate accommodation.  These units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance.  While the placement of households in these units will be on a temporary basis, they will offer a greater level of stability than the alternative of hotel accommodation while options for long-term living are being secured.<\/p><p> It is intended to have the first 150 of the units delivered in the Dublin City Council area, with the city council expecting the delivery of an initial 22 units by December, a further 128 units to follow in the first quarter of 2016 through a fast&ndash;tracked procurement process and 350 units across the Dublin region by mid-2016.  This compares with a timeframe of up to two years to provide conventional social housing units.<\/p><p> In light of this and to support the use of the fastest planning process in order for the modular units to be in place as quickly as possible, the Minister, Deputy Kelly indicated his intention to issue a policy directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, addressed to the four Dublin planning authorities.  A draft policy directive has been prepared in this regard and, as required, has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of the draft policy directive is to remind those planning authorities of the statutory provisions of section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the related Part 8 provisions in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  These provisions set out the procedure for local authority own development, such as the provision of new housing developments.<\/p><p> In the context of discharging these functions, and in particular the need to provide urgent social housing to meet the needs of homeless families, the draft policy directive directs these planning authorities to utilise all powers available to them under section 179, as appropriate, for the purpose of finding solutions to the social housing situation currently faced and accelerating the delivery of social housing developments to address the urgent and increasing need for social housing accommodation in the Dublin region.  Subject to Oireachtas approval, this policy directive will issue to the Dublin planning authorities under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended and the four planning authorities will be bound to comply with the directive.<\/p><p> The legislative basis for a policy directive underpins and strengthens any policy direction the Minister may wish to issue.  The issuing of a policy directive in the context of the delivery of social housing will underscore the importance of the expeditious delivery of this programme of modular housing, as approved by the Government.  It is essential that this programme is expeditiously implemented.  From a planning perspective, this draft policy directive is aimed at doing just that &ndash; supporting the programme and the relevant planning authorities that are delivering it.<\/p><p> Addressing the current problems in the Irish housing market is a key Government priority, as can be seen from the recently announced package of measures entitled &ldquo;Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply&rdquo; aimed at improving stability in the private rental sector and supporting increased housing supply.  The programme for delivery of modular housing supported by the policy directive, implementation of the Construction 2020 strategy and the social housing strategy together with the new housing package, collectively provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring that homes are provided for those who need them.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss this important policy directive and trust it will be approved in order that it can be issued to the relevant planning authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#FF00300","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I doubt there is anything in this the local authorities are not already familiar with.  We are all aware of Part 8 and the other Part.  The Minister of State might tell us what additional powers are in this of which the local authorities might not already be aware.  If they had known they had to plan for this a year ago, we would not be talking about reminding them of their powers.  The inadequacy of the funding that has been available has led to this crisis in delivering social housing.<\/p><p>I note this just relates to Dublin.  There is a housing crisis in a number of other centres of population.  This week's <i>daft.ie<\/i>analysis of the increase in rents shows a stabilisation in the city centre and an acceleration of rents in other areas.  The problem is not confined to Dublin, although I accept it has been the epicentre.  The tenancy protection unit that was put in place last year was also exclusive to Dublin.  The pattern of what is happening outside Dublin is that whole families are being broken up with their belongings stored in a variety of locations, with family members perhaps being separated as well.  It is manifesting itself in a very different way.  <\/p><p>I have great concerns about the modular housing.  It is not cheap.  It costs somewhere in the region of &euro;190,000 per unit if I am right.  It has a life span of 60 years and is not a temporary solution.  We are putting something very permanent in place.  Planning should involve considering a variety of things, including the provision of housing, how that housing relates to other services that should be available and the cohesiveness of the community that is to be developed.  We are in an emergency situation, which sometimes forces a less than optimum response.  If we go back to the 1960s and the high-rise development that was Ballymun, in retrospect that was not a great idea.  We are back in a crisis situation now and it is important the Department outlines the sense in which it perceives these houses will be a short-term measure rather than just saying they are short term.  What length of time does it foresee people being in them?<\/p><p>Modular or system-built housing is used in other parts of the world and is perfectly good when it is in the right location and of a good standard.  It is the other issues that go with it that cause me some concern.  The housing might have a dual function.  We have 25,000 students accommodated around the country.  Housing that doubled as student accommodation for the second part of its function might be useful.  The housing might then be placed in a different location and produce a different type of accommodation.  It is really important we do not end up with identifiable ghettos.<\/p><p>It is also important to outline exactly what the response is going to be in places outside Dublin.<\/p><p> In terms of the tenancy protection service, one must consider people not being taken off social welfare because they have no address.  Tomorrow is the closing date for the electoral register.  A person needs an address to get on the electoral register.  A homeless, man who has been sleeping rough since August 2014, told me he wants to vote.  The response I got to a parliamentary question was that the local authority should be a bit flexible about that.  Legislation does not allow flexibility and a person needs an address to vote.  With tomorrow's closing date, the people most impacted by this crisis are those who will not be able to have a say on who will represent them.  Many people are very mobile because of this and there is a great deal of instability - much more than is measured by the number of people who are living in hotel accommodation.  Outside the Dublin region, it manifests itself very differently because some counties do not have hostels.<\/p><p> It was said that the tenancy protection service would be extended to other places but it was not.  There is a need to take a wider approach.  In my area, people trying to source accommodation in the Kildare, Meath and Wicklow areas are finding they are being pushed out, which is increasing the pressure in areas under pressure already.  We need a wider response than we have had to date.  I welcome what the Minister had to say about the longevity of the modular units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#HH00100","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett do you wish to say something?

The tenancy protection service only operates in Dublin and Cork but consideration is being given to extending that.  It is being delivered by Threshold and the Department of Social Protection.  I remind members that rent supplement can be topped up with the services of the community welfare officer to stall people who are under threat of homelessness, so there is that flexibility.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty with this is that we have to respond to the homeless situation.  We have to remind planning authorities of the statutory provisions of section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Part 8 of the planning and development regulations 2001 to 2015 relate to local authorities' own development and direct those planning authorities to utilise all powers available to them under those provisions as appropriate for the purpose of finding solutions to the housing situation and accelerating the delivery of social housing developments to address the increasing social housing need in the region.<\/p> <p>  These are the modular homes that can be delivered quickly and are suitable for families.  I understand the Deputy's concerns but this is an immediate response to try to do something about the situation.  The Deputies should welcome this directive.  The Government is trying to do something to alleviate a really bad situation, particularly in the Dublin area.  If we consider our own lives, I do not think any of us would particularly like to house ourselves and our families in hotels.  Some modular housing is of an extremely high standard, as Deputy Murphy has said.<\/p><p>It is used extensively, even for elderly people, particularly in Britain.  Nobody is suggesting this is the long-term solution for these families.  It is a short-term solution.  Modular housing has a lifespan of 50 to 60 years.  It is not that anybody is saying that these are permanent houses for these people.  This is the Government responding to the situation that will arise again at Christmas when we will have those awful stories of people who are homeless and on our streets.  This is the Government responding in a very quick way.  In Ballymun, 22 units that will house 22 families will be delivered very soon.  Dublin City Council awarded the contract last Friday.

The Minister of State did not outline the additional powers in this that are not already available to the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of the blame game going on in the context of local authorities not delivering.  The Department is appearing to crack the whip.  The Minister of State did not tell me how modular housing will have a limited lifespan or that it will not be a permanent solution for those tenants who avail of it.<\/p> <p>  I have spent the whole year dealing with families, negotiating increases in rent caps up to about &euro;1,300 and more on some occasions.  The problem is the HAP scheme is to be introduced in my local authority area and will make the situation worse because the amount we can negotiate will reduce.  One can increase by 20% above the HAP rate, which is below market rents.  So we will see a flood of additional homeless people because the HAP amounts are below market rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#KK00200","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>As I mentioned to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, when leaving the earlier session, I would like an instruction to be given to all local authorities to the effect that the eligibility criteria for any of the schemes designed to keep people in homes or get them into homes if they are on the housing list or homeless should be relaxed and there should be flexibility.  Too often, in the context of a series of issues - including HAP, RAS and other schemes - officials are operating to the letter of the law which is what they understand they have to do.  They would be worried if they did anything other than respect the letter of the law because they might get rapped over the knuckles by the Department for doing so.  This leads to a bureaucratic stupidity which is no individual's fault.  There is a need for an instruction from the top to the effect that people should be flexible.  Obviously, if they are going outside particular eligibility criteria, they should note that and if that is subsequently perceived to be a problem, it could be addressed.  However, we need more flexibility and, in the first instance, people need to be encouraged to be flexible and not say, \"You don't quite tick all the boxes here, therefore you can't go for this scheme.\"<\/p><p>We are dealing with a case at the moment of a couple who are working whose landlord proposes to increase the rent from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200.  They cannot afford that and will become homeless.  However, their landlord says he would be interested in doing RAS but because they are working, they are not eligible for RAS so they will be put out of their home.  HAPS is not operational in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for some odd reason, because it is a pilot.  It should be bloody well brought in everywhere - I do not like it but we should at least have a level playing field.  There must be flexibility.  The official in that situation needs to say: \"We can stop these people becoming homeless here by making a dispensation to keep them in their home.\"  I will give another example of where flexibility is needed of a situation where a landlord is selling the property, even though he is very happy with the tenants who have always payed their rent.  He does not want to put these people out on the street, this message is passed via the tenants to me and to the council.  He tells the council he would like to sell the house back to keep these people in their home rather than allow the property to go on the free market.  That is very nice of the landlord, a lot of people would not do that, but he is told it cannot be done because authorisation is needed.  <\/p><p> The policy must be to get people into houses or prevent them from being evicted, whatever that takes.  The mortgage to rent scheme - where people are in arrears and the banks are supposed to offer them a suite of options to keep them in their homes - would have been helpful to many people on low income.  There has been a spectacular failure in the delivery of this scheme for reasons I do not fully understand.  A policy should be introduced where people are automatically put on the mortgage to rent scheme rather than evicted.  Resources should be provided to local authorities to buy those houses to prevent evictions and the properties rented back to people.  That would take the pressure off the thousands of people currently afraid they will lose their homes and be placed on council lists or in homelessness services anyway.  <\/p><p> On modular housing, what guarantees can the Minister provide that short term will not become long term?  I am very sceptical about this move.  I do not want to be obstructive to any measure that would solve an emergency but I am deeply worried, as I think many people are, that this will become a long-term solution.  The Minister initially referred to a figure of six months but what happens to a tenant after six months?  Will tenants and families have key workers assigned to them during that period to assist them to get housed, one way or another, through local authority schemes, HAP or whatever?<\/p><p> On NAMA hotels, a suggestion has been made that these would be reconfigured and redesigned to provide emergency accommodation.  Has the Minister examined whether this could be a better, faster, more appropriate option than modular housing?<\/p><p>These hotels are currently unsuitable but if work on them could be done within a six month period - we are talking about a lead-in time of six months or longer for the modular housing - would it not be more appropriate to reconfigure them to provide the emergency short-term accommodation we need to alleviate the crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#KK00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Families will be moved from modular housing to normal social housing within as short a timeframe as possible and there will be an on-site family placement service to deal with this.

We can send the Deputy some detail on that.  I take on board his points.<\/p> <p>  On NAMA properties, local authorities and the housing agency have engaged with NAMA.  Some 65 units of Tallaght Cross apartments have already been equipped by South Dublin County Council.  NAMA residential acquistions have happened and we have considered the hotels issue.  The difficulty is in trying to get solutions before Christmas because we have to have them in place by 21 December.  That is why modular housing is so important.<\/p><p>It provides solutions for families who have to stay in hotels.  I do not think families would prefer to stay in hotels, even if they were refurbished.  I think they would prefer to be in these modular houses that are of a very high standard.  They want a home not a hotel room, with all the difficulties that presents.<\/p><p> An affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of budget 2016 and is currently being developed within the Department.  A sum of &euro;10 million has been made available for the scheme from the proceeds of the sale of Bord Gais &Eacute;ireann.  This is an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long-term increase in the supply of housing for affordable rental.  The scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental costs from their own resources with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to households on low to moderate incomes as well as being a possible support option for some households which qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention such as a subsidy will be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford and what the housing market charges.  Such a scheme would also facilitate and incentivise private investment in this sector.  I want to see work completed on the scheme as soon as possible, so that it is ready by December.  Affordable rental will be a separate scheme from the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The Deputy can consider the detail to see if it addresses his concerns.  <\/p><p> New measures will ensure rents can only be increased every two years.  The Minister made an announcement in that regard a short time ago.  Landlords will be required to give 90 days notice of a rent increase.  The Government is also addressing the issue of rent certainty which will give people a breathing space while we are waiting for built units to come on stream to supplement the supply issue. <\/p><p> Deputy Murphy asked about the extra powers being given to local authorities.  The measures we are talking about actually go beyond Part VIII.  There are powers under section 179(6)(b) of the Act under which a local authority chief executive can dispense with the normal Part VIII planning process for the local authority's own development where a proposed development is necessary to deal urgently with any situation which the chief executive considers to be an emergency situation calling for immediate action. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015112400002#MM01000","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448374500,"counter":309,"content":"<p>That concludes our discussion on the motion.

This week the Energy Council takes place against the backdrop of the horror that has been recently visited on the people of Paris and France.  The meeting also takes place against a backdrop of virtually unprecedented global co-operation on energy and energy matters.  I was exposed to both topics together last week when I visited Paris to attend the ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency.  The French Government decided that the meeting should go ahead as planned on Tuesday and Wednesday last and we, the Ministers, agreed that we should demonstrate our solidarity with the French Government and people at this time.  <\/p> <p>  The central focus of the IEA meeting is hugely in keeping with the main topic for this Thurday's meeting of the EU Council of Energy Ministers which is energy union.<\/p><p>Energy union can also be read as solidarity within Europe on energy matters.  The very foundation of the International Energy Agency is energy solidarity.  The agency was founded almost 41 years ago against the backdrop of the first oil crisis.  Ireland and 28 countries have worked together since then with the goal of strengthening and ensuring adequate energy emergency response mechanisms.  At last week's meeting, Ministers endorsed significant development of the IEA's future role in an evolving global energy system.  For example, security of energy supply for IEA members is to be an expanded focus for the IEA.  Ministers also agreed the addition of a third pillar to the IEA's international role to embrace a new focus on energy efficiency and new technologies.  Overall, Ministers reiterated a firm IEA commitment to enhanced co-operation on energy matters right across the globe.<\/p><p> This Thursday's meeting of the Energy Council will be focused to a large extent on enhanced energy co-operation at EU level.  Energy union is the firmest embodiment yet of this goal of energy co-operation at EU level.  In essence, energy union can be <\/p><p>described as a framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy.  Ireland is a strong supporter of energy union and believes that its five key dimensions are worthy goals.  These are: energy security; solidarity and trust; a fully integrated European energy market; energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand; decarbonising the economy; and research, innovation and competitiveness.<\/p><p> Ireland is also a keen advocate of citizen engagement and empowerment and, in this context, is particularly pleased that energy union puts citizens at its core.  This is fully in keeping with our own commitment to doing just that here in Ireland, in the context of the new energy White Paper that I intend to publish in December.  The process involved in its preparation has been hugely focused on citizen and business engagement and consultation.  <\/p><p> The energy union agenda is energetically championed by the EU Vice President for Energy Union, Maros &Scaron;efovi.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi visited Dublin in September and we held substantive discussions.  In Dublin and again at the Energy Council on Thursday in Brussels, I have and will continue to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s agenda regarding energy union.  As a member state on the periphery of Europe, I believe that Ireland will see significant benefits from the energy union.  Just like access to the Single Market led to an economic transition for Ireland, energy union will be a key driver in our transition to a low-carbon future. <\/p><p> At the Energy Ministers Council on Thursday a key milestone in the evolution of energy union will be achieved with agreement on governance structures.  These are largely focused on measurement and evaluation, key attributes Ireland supports.  It is, therefore, my intention to welcome energy union and to support the proposed governance structures.  <\/p><p> Energy union will not be without challenges.  In particular - this is a second topic for discussion at the Energy Ministers Council on Thursday - the development of a single wholesale market design may not be appropriate for all national and regional markets in the European Union.  Ireland believes that countries currently implementing the third energy package, including the electricity target model, should not be required to implement further significant changes prior to the necessary infrastructure being developed.  In order to overcome this challenge, Ireland intends to increase the level of electricity interconnection.  In particular, I would highlight the proposed electricity interconnector between Ireland and France as a critical component of Ireland's access to the integrated market.<\/p><p> The third and final key topic for discussion at Energy Council this week concerns a new initiative on energy efficiency labelling.  At Council, Ministers will discuss an important new and improved legal framework for the energy labelling of energy-related products.  The main objective of the new proposed framework is to encourage innovation and the production of ever more efficient products.  It will enable customers to make informed choices about energy efficiency and consumption when making their purchases and thus contribute to the overall moderation of energy demand at Union level.  There is considerable untapped energy saving potential in the field of energy-related products and appliances.  Ireland has engaged positively in negotiations on this framework to date.<\/p><p> Energy union affords Ireland valuable opportunities to further strengthen our national energy systems.  I plan to positively reflect Ireland's willingness to engage with the concept with zest at the Energy Council on Thursday.<\/p><p> As I will be appearing before the committee again next week - I very much look forward to that - to discuss wider energy policy matters, today I propose just to discuss topics associated with the Energy Council meeting on Thursday, as outlined in these opening remarks.

It will reintroduce the simple A to H scale in place of the current more complex approach with A, A+, A++, A+++ and so on.  I said to officials earlier that it is a case of grade inflation in the energy labelling of products.  It will reorganise that and make it a bit more sensible, allowing people to understand it better.  The top-rating classes are becoming overpopulated so we are trying to bring it back down in order that it is realistic and understandable.  It will be a system that people can abide by.<\/p> <p>  Energy labelling enables consumers to make informed purchasing decisions by providing information to them on the energy a product actually consumes.  We had some concerns on the matter.  Most of our concerns have been addressed and we now support the compromise text proposed.<\/p><p> The broader issue of energy efficiency is one we are very keen to advance and members will see it featuring very prominently in the White Paper.  It is often said the cheapest energy is the energy we do not consume.  We are progressing the necessary decarbonisation of our economy and, as every country in the world will have to do this, it will be a very relevant topic of discussion and debate in the context of the Conference of the Parties, COP.  We need to pivot every economy away from the burning of fossil fuels towards renewable energy but, in particular, towards energy efficiency so that we use less energy in our homes, in businesses, in production and manufacturing, in public buildings, such as this one, and so on across the board.  That is a big push.  We now have more money in the capital programme to ensure this can be done here but we need to continue our efforts on energy efficiency.  I agree with the Deputy on how important that is.<\/p><p> In respect of the market design issue, we have things to say which we will say on Thursday and which I have said before at Council meetings.  We want to see progress but we also want a sensible level of progress for countries like Ireland.  For example, we already have an all-island electricity market, and we are an exemplar in that regard.  That has been in place for a number of years and we are progressing it through the integrated single electricity market, ISEM, for which a lot of work is taking place.  We also have to complete certain actions under the third energy package.  What we will be saying to our colleagues is, yes, let us progress, yes, let us advance this agenda, but let us do certain things properly first and let us not have a multitude of demands and changes all happening at the same time.  We want to ensure we progress in a sensible way and in ways that work for individual countries like Ireland.  There is a not a one-size-fits-all solution to these complex issues and we have to make sure our own conditions and requirements are respected in the changes that occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#F00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

It has been my experience at these meetings that there is a high level of co-operation and interest in each other's conditions and circumstances.  There is a very good level of debate.  One learns a lot at these meetings about what is happening and best practice in other countries.  One also learns about the views of other countries as to the advances we have made in this country, and it is important we should remember that.  For example, on the renewables side, it is recognised among our European partners that we have made very good progress in Ireland.  There is a high level of co-operation between countries.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, people have different perspectives, given where they come from.  For example, to take the issue of nuclear, some countries are resolutely opposed, sometimes even opposed to discussion about nuclear, while other countries were prominent nuclear power countries that have changed their position.  Germany has recently changed its perspective and the Austrians are very strong on the question of nuclear.  There is often a reluctance to even have issues like that discussed, let alone any suggestion that people would take the same view on them.  This is an interesting twist that is sometimes seen.<\/p> <p>  On the question of security, it is natural to think first of some of the countries on the eastern side of the EU which have a direct supply of gas from Russia and where there have been concerns in regard to potential interruptions in that supply.<\/p><p>That colours their approach to energy security and the geopolitical issues that are manifest in that part of the world in the post-Ukraine situation we are in.  Energy security is important for everybody, including us.  It is at the heart of what we need to do.  When we talk about changes and moving to renewable energy, we always have to bear in mind the critical importance of security of supply.  We can wax lyrical about the need to move to renewables, and I certainly do, but the first requirement is that we have a supply of energy for homes and businesses in this country.  Therefore, security of supply is important for everybody.<\/p><p> Innovation is at the heart of what we do and it is a big part of the White Paper, given the sheer volume of innovation, ideas and products now coming forward.  Just to take the energy efficiency area we were talking about, in terms of controlling consumption in a domestic setting literally through a mobile telephone, people will be able to remotely control the use of energy in their homes, such as when it comes on and goes off.  With smart metering they will be able to manage their consumption of energy, not just through the day but also through the night, and they will be able to maximise what they can do in a home, in a business or on a farm.  Innovation is going to drive this, and there are a many outstanding Irish firms and spin-offs that are prominent in this field.<\/p><p> We have a new energy research strategy, which I will be publishing at the same time as the White Paper and which pulls together many of the strands of this development.  There have been great advances in the universities and research institutions, which have terrific people working hard to bring forward new ideas, and there are also those in the commercial sector looking to commercialise them.  At the COP, as one would expect, there is a day focused on energy, one on transport, one on agriculture and so on, and I noticed there is also to be a day on innovation, which I believe is very appropriate.  The Deputy is right that this will really transform things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#G00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I know the Minister will touch on this in a week and a half but I have a follow-up question for him.

If that is the case, it cannot be a good backdrop for an energy policy or for any policy.  There is a responsibility on governments, on Ministers and on politicians to first, understand the issues, which I know the members of this committee do, but also to explain and debate those issues in public and to explain why we take decisions and why we have taken certain directions in our energy policy.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the changes that have to take place in Ireland and in every economy in the world, although we have discussed the 2020 targets, we must bear in mind that in February or March of next year we will have new targets for 2030.  Those targets will not come out of Paris immediately because effectively, there will be a negotiation at the global level to try to achieve a deal.  There was already a commitment at the European Council meeting last year in terms of all-EU targets, which have been set, and Ireland&rsquo;s new targets for 2030 will be set in the very early part of next year.  We will have to make big changes in how we manage our economy and energy consumption, and not just on the energy side because this also affects agriculture, transport and all of these other areas.<\/p><p>We will all need to be at the top of our game as public representatives but we will also need to have a generous and open conversation with the people of Ireland on what changes are necessary, why they are necessary and how we propose to bring people with us.

Quite a lot of data are available in respect of the success of onshore wind as a cost-effective form of renewable energy.  It is, undoubtedly, the most cost-effective form of renewable energy available to us, as matters stand.  Up to 22.7% of our electricity is already generated from renewables, most of which is from onshore wind farms.<\/p><p> We are in a consultation process for a new refit scheme which will look at new technologies and the prospect of subsidising solar, for example, biomass, offshore wind and others energy forms.  Some of these are at a fairly early stage of development, while others have made more progress.  As I told the House last week, we have all read about the dramatic reduction in price for solar-generated energy.  One has to assess whether it would make sense from an economic point of view to subsidise solar power.  I must emphasise I am just commenting rather than indicating any energy policy decisions as we have not made any yet.  While one wants to encourage renewables, does one need to subsidise them?  Will some new forms of renewables happen anyway because the market will occur without the State having to subsidise them?  I made the point last week in the House that some other countries in Europe regret having gone into solar power too early, subsidising it heavily, when now it looks like all of these developments could have occurred without such heavy subsidies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#K01200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>We are coming close to the point where the Minister will be giving me credit for increasing consumer prices.

It will have much of the information, the data and experience in respect of renewable energy in Ireland and the relative success of different technologies.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is not unique.  Every country is addressing the move to renewable energy and wants to make progress in this regard.  Many countries are making great strides.  It is a process that has to accelerate, however.  That might not necessarily be music to everybody&rsquo;s ears but it has to be accelerated if we are serious about decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>  People point to the other technologies.  We can diversify.  Onshore wind does not have to be the answer on its own in this agenda.  It will inevitably be a prominent part of the answer, given its cost effectiveness.  We should diversify and we will diversify, however.  In this refit consultation, we will be able to see what the best technologies for diversifying are, the most successful, the cheapest and what level of subsidies will they need.  I am very excited about many of these new technologies, particularly offshore wind which has amazing and incredible potential, particularly for a country like Ireland.  However, it will take a considerable number of years for those technologies to come through and being capable of being funded and supported.  As I keep saying, for whoever is in this job next year or for the next five years and beyond, decarbonisation is going to be one of the most critical, if not the most critical, issues this country will have to face, as will every other country.  We cannot do it without some heavy lifting.  If we decide to move away from one form of energy, we will have to replace it with another.  There are no simple answers to these questions.

I have looked at something that could conserve significant energy in this country and reduce carbon emissions.  It relates to the different motorways.  Having entered and exited on a straight stretch of road, I saw 80 high-powered lighting columns on either side of the road that I would contend are not necessary in most instances.  The most recent motorways built in the South, such as the M8 and M7, which have barriers in the middle with reflectors, do the job adequately.  This should be looked at, and I have seen it in the US.  One section of a motorway here, which I will not name, contains more lights than one would find if one crisscrossed the US.  If one took the main highway across the US from New York to San Francisco, I honestly believe one would find fewer lights than on a motorway in this country.  The use of high-powered lighting columns from dawn to dusk should be examined.  Could we do without them or dim them from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.?  There would be significant energy and monetary savings and a reduction in carbon emissions if we looked into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#M00900","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I have a couple of questions for him.  <\/p> <p>  Many of Europe's gas supplies come from Russia.  We need to be realistic about where we are going in this regard in the next 20 or 30 years.  Is it fair to say the plan is to continue to rely on Russia to meet up to 50% of Europe's gas requirements or is any change proposed in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the need for greater efficiency.  I agree with him in that regard.  Every public representative will have engaged with councils on the retrofitting of houses.  While one council will offer only one incentive to increase energy efficiency, others will offer up to five.  There is, therefore, no common denominator in the resolution of this problem across the country.<\/p> <p>  When attending European Council meetings the Minister should argue that Ireland is a special case.  We have just come through one of the worst ever batterings experienced by any country.  With luck, we hope to increase employment levels by up to 150,000 in the next few years.  The more employment we create, the more people we will have in business and the more cars there will be on the roads.  Electricity prices in Ireland are the third highest in Europe.  On the need for increased efficiency and the proposed change to bio-energy, we need to be honest and tell the people that as we cannot produce biomass here, we will have to import it.  <\/p> <p>  On solar energy, in a programme I saw last night on television it was stated that without subsidisation, the solar energy proposition would not work.  Wind energy generation is subsidised.  A person who sets up a business must be able to make a profit.  If a business is not profitable, no one is going to give the businessperson &euro;100 million to keep him going just because he is a great fellow who is employing people.  In terms of the alternatives being considered, we are not stacking up to stand alone in bringing about a substantial decrease in the cost of electricity.  <\/p> <p>  What is being said about wind energy generation does not stack up and there is no point in saying otherwise.  Iin the context of European discussions, we need to make the point that Ireland is a special case.  As I said, it has just come through a ferocious recession and is now starting to climb the hill in terms of the numbers now at work.  The country is starting to recover, but let us live in the real world.  As elderly farmers pass on their farms, with a little luck, there will be more cattle on every farm, which will result in increased carbon emissions.  We need to make our case in Europe.  In ten to 15 years interconnectors will have improved significantly.  In terms of energy production, it will be cheaper for us to import energy supplies from France and Britain where I understand it is proposed to construct five new nuclear plants than to produce energy here with the biomass we propose to import from Africa.  We need to be realistic about where we are going in this regard.  Has consideration been given to hydro-energy projects?  Is consideration being given to generating energy in that way which may be a more viable alternative?  At the end of the day we cannot live with a blanket over the country to try to eliminate all carbon emissions.  People have to live, eat and work and the country has to survive.  In terms of EU targets, we need to make the argument in Europe that we must first ensure people can live and work in this country.<\/p><p>I know that the Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, are discussing the issue of distances.

In eastern Europe much of the emphasis is on fossil fuels; in central Europe nuclear energy is a big factor, while renewable energy resources are a big driver in this country and others.  There are huge challenges in securing a consolidated energy policy throughout the European Union.  How are we going to meet these challenges?  What is the opinion of eastern European member states that recently gained accession to the European Union and the economies of which would not be as robust as those of other member states in dealing with these changes?  A consolidated energy market would result in greater competitiveness for consumers, but there would also be an inherent risk.  Will the Minister be meeting his counterparts in the directorate general to discuss the opportunities such consolidation would present for large European energy companies through mergers and acquisitions, where they might become too big in delivering energy supplies in the European Union and if the balance would be tipped from being a competitive to an anti-competitive market in which there might be a monopoly?  We must be careful in addressing the issue of consolidation of the energy market that we do not tip the balance in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#O00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his questions and members for their interesting questions and insights.  <\/p> <p>  To respond to Senator Terry Brennan's comments, lighting is an important issue.  He gave some good examples with reference to motorways.  Adopting a dimming and trimming approach to public lighting is critically important in our engagement with local authorities on the public service energy efficiency plan.

Local authorities have responsibility in this regard.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, formerly the NRA, also has a responsibility in that regard.  There are issues related to safety on the roads, with which it must deal.  However, the overall push must be and is towards achieving energy efficiency, of which lighting forms a very big part.  Other countries are also adopting dimming and trimming approaches, including the use of LED lighting and so on.  There is a great deal that we could do in that regard.  I agree with the Senator whom I thank for his comments.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice made a number of points and the one that stands out for me concerns the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth.  He asked if we had more people in employment and more people driving on the roads and if that inevitably meant an increase in energy consumption.  One issue all policy makers, both here and internationally, are trying to address is how can we decouple an increase in energy consumption from economic growth.  Nobody wants to stem or stop economic growth, but we have to sunder the link that with economic growth which has meant greater consumption of energy.  We have to try to change the graph and ensure economic growth does not necessarily mean an increase in energy consumption.  That is why we are very focused on addressing this issue of efficiency and reducing and curtailing the consumption of energy in various processes, whether it be manufacturing or others.<\/p><p>Yesterday I was at the Abbott plant in Sligo.  It and many other companies have energy-efficiency programmes within their operations.  Abbott is obviously involved in a particular field of diagnostics and so on.  Many other companies are doing this.  It is not always a great idea to mention one company, but it is not alone in this.  Many similar companies, large and small, are looking at this to try to decouple these two things.  We want employment growth, but we want to reduce energy consumption.  If there are more cars on the road in two or three years time, there might be more electric vehicles on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#O00700","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Last week representatives of the Irish EV Owners Association appeared before the committee.

It will all take time.  Everything in the area we are discussing takes time.  We need to consider a timeframe not of just a few months, like the political cycle teaches us.  We need to consider timeframes of five, ten or 15 years.  We talk about offshore wind and other new technologies.  We probably will not be here to see that, but we need to lay the groundwork now and make the right decisions to ensure that the people who come after us can bring these developments forward.<\/p> <p>  The Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Mark Carney, used the phrase, \"the tragedy of horizons\", in a piece he wrote recently.  Policymakers and even consumers in our own homes only see so far.  We all have scarce resources and we need to decide what to spend it on.  We do not tend to spend money on something that will give us a benefit in ten years time.  If that is scaled up to the level of governments and policymakers, the same problem exists.  It is a tragedy of horizon.  The members of this committee can see that these are long-terms calls that have to be made.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a comment on wind energy and we might talk about this again next week.  Onshore wind energy is proven to be cost effective.  It is subsidised; it would not have happened without a subsidy.  It has required a subsidy and will in all likelihood require a continuing subsidy.  We have to hope that in the medium to long term that we are discussing, it will not require a subsidy, and that the market and technologies will be such that it will be able to be rolled out, enhanced and expanded without subsidy.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about making a special case and so on.  It is true that we have to make a special case to Europe about our own situation.  However, every country, including this one, has to step up here.  Every citizen will have to be part of this.  While I am not suggesting the Deputy is saying this, there is no use in any of us claiming that something is not realistic.  There will always be ten or 15 reasons for not doing something, but very often the alternative is worse.<\/p> <p>  If we decide to embrace decarbonisation, there are ways of implementing and delivering that over a period of ten, 15 or 20 years out to 2030 and ultimately 2050.  The G7 is suggesting a completely decarbonised world by the end of the century.  We can play our part in that now.  I do not believe it is unrealistic for politicians to talk about that kind of a long term.  People look back and ask what we did when we had an opportunity to make those changes.  That is the responsibility we hold.<\/p> <p>  We have assessed the opportunities for hydroelectricity.  We do not see potential for large-scale hydroelectricity in this country.  It has been well assessed and well studied.  Small projects might work.  In 1927 when the plant in Ardnacrusha was constructed, that project accounted for in excess of 90% of our electricity-generation requirement.  Now it is definitely in single figures.  I am advised that it is 1%.  Obviously, we live in a different world from the world of the 1920s.<\/p><p>Hydroelectricity was an incredible project then.  It is a renewable energy.  It was a fantastic, far-sighted project.  However, we do not believe we have the potential for similar type large scale projects in this country in the period ahead.<\/p><p> I made a careful note of the Deputy's point about county councils.<\/p><p> The Acting Chairman made a point about the difficulties attendant on trying to bring all the member states together, given their different histories, requirements and pressures.  He is correct.  However, it important to remember, and Deputy Colreavy raised this with me previously, that the decisions on fuel mix remain member state competencies and there is no proposal to change that.  Fuel mix sovereignty will remain, even in the context of energy union.  Of course there are big challenges in trying to bring together all of the member states across the Union given their different requirements.<\/p><p> The Deputy is correct that where there are very large operators there is a risk of them crowding out smaller operators and crowding out the opportunities there might be in countries such as Ireland.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a real risk.  We are very conscious of that in these discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015112400002#P00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448368200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The Minister forgot to deal with one question.

It is hard to justify a set-back distance that is not linked to the issues of noise and shadow flicker, in other words just set-back distance <i>simpliciter<\/i>.
