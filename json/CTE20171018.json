I want this to be a committee at which everybody feels they can say what they wish to say without feeling any sense of nervousness or other feelings to witnesses or otherwise.  It is quite reasonable for members of this committee to leave the room for a variety of reasons.  It has already been indicated in private session that a couple of members must speak in the D&aacute;il presently and there is no doubt certain members will have to speak in the Seanad on occasion.  People must leave the room for a variety of reasons.  The nature of our business in politics ensures that there is a very busy environment in Leinster House.  The message must go out that this is a very important committee that has a very high attendance rate by members and it does happen, on occasion, that people need to leave for a variety of reasons.  I just wanted to put that on the record.  <\/p> <p>  If members have concerns, it is better to indicate.  If a member has a concern about something another member has said please indicate and I will come to that person at the appropriate time.  I do not want members interrupted, which is really important to note.  Everybody has a certain amount of time with the witnesses.  It is very important that we respect that space for the individual member within the confines of the rules of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When somebody has the floor I want everybody to respect that in so far as is possible.  If members have concerns I would appreciate if they could be raised in the committee.  If there is an issue that they do not wish to raise in the committee, publicly, I can be approached at any time for a chat if there is something a member wants to discuss.  <\/p> <p>  On the matter of witnesses who present here, witnesses need to be respected.  They are professional individuals.  They are well used to taking strident cross-examination and questions in circumstances like this one.  I have no difficulty with witnesses being asked questions.  It is difficult to control the time and there is an issue with regard to the amount of time for members.  We have reached agreement in terms of how we will conduct ourselves timewise.  Again, if people have issues in that regard please highlight them to me.  I am doing my best as Chair to be fair to everybody and that is all I can do.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to a perceived bias in terms of this committee, concerns have been raised again, mainly outside of this room, regarding the witness schedule.  The committee itself decided who should attend.  I, as Chair, do not choose which witnesses come before this committee.  It continues to be the case that any member who believes that any other person or institution should be represented at this committee should make that known to me.  Travel by an individual is justified in terms of the method that we agreed at the outset of this committee.  Any concerns about specific witnesses should be raised ideally with me and not with the media so that I can be put on notice of any issues that members have.  I refer in particular to the Centre for Reproductive Rights where issues have been expressed about fundraising and issues in the media.  Again, I am seeking to address this matter and will come back to the committee. <\/p> <p>  At the outset I just wanted to be really clear on a few issues.  Our witnesses are present and some of them have travelled.  We are very grateful to them for their attendance.  I want to move on in that regard, subject to Deputy Mattie McGrath making a comment.  I want to give him an opportunity to address an issue that he has raised, and wants to raise in public, that follows on from last week.  The Deputy has the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#C00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I do not mind waiting until our guests have finished but I want to comment in public session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#C00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I can take it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#D00100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>All right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#D00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I anticipate that it will only take the Deputy a couple of minutes to clarify his position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#D00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wrote to the Chairman and thank her for the opportunity to speak.<\/p><p>I want the Chair to note that I absolutely reject the allegations made against me by Senator Jerry Buttimer in my absence last week, he accused me of glibly quoting what he described as reports from Duke University and suggested that I was doing so in a manner that was dishonest. <\/p><p>I want to put it on record that the research I referred to was performed at one of the premier universities in America and in the world.  It was published in a respected peer reviewed medical journal entitled <i>Prenatal Diagnosis<\/i>.  If Deputy Buttimer and his consultants had more carefully reviewed this study they would have noted that the authors recruited the majority of participants from a pre-existing study database, the Hereditary Basis of Neural Tube Defects study conducted at Duke University Medical Center and only approximately one third of the participants originated from social media.  Objective reporting on the study would recognise that the authors reported a possible bias based on the recruitment source; they recognised that there was a difference in severity of symptoms in the two groups, and recognising this potential influence on results, made source of referral a covariate in the analysis to limit the source impact.<\/p><p>Cope et al. is a comparative study of women and their outcomes after terminating or carrying a child with anencephaly to term.  It is not, as some might believe after listening to Senator Buttimer and Professor Fergal Malone, simply a report from women recruited from social media who carried a child to term with anencephaly.  This study offers important insights into outcomes for women after termination of pregnancy following a diagnosis of anencephaly in contrast with outcomes where the pregnancy was continued.  To dismiss this study is scientifically unreasonable but it might be understandable if there were significant data to suggest that termination of the life of an infant with anencephaly had no impact on mothers or improved the medical health of mothers later in life.  The fact is there is no such study and all we are left with is the unsupported opinions of those who are committed to the expansion of abortion services.  It is dismaying to see anyone being dismissive of research that identifies poor mental health outcomes for women related to abortion after a diagnosis of anencephaly simply because they do not suit a pro-abortion narrative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#D00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

This is of some relevance to the issue under discussion.  The detailed report on the confidential inquiries is included and referenced in my statement.<br\/><br\/>I greatly appreciate the first report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment of the Constitution, published on 29 June 2017.  I commend the Citizens' Assembly on its work.  The report is an impressive achievement by people who are not health care specialists or experts, but spent five weekends considering the issues.  The members of the Citizens' Assembly voted on their recommendations for access to abortion for certain medical and other conditions.  Members are, of course, familiar with the results of the ballots and these can be viewed in the report.<br\/><br\/>I would like members to consider the opposite side of the coin and if the same questions were asked such as: &quot;Would you send the women who procured abortion for these reasons to prison?&quot;  A research project in Brazil led by the eminent obstetrician and gynaecologist, Professor Anibal Faundes, surveyed 1,660 civil servants and 874 medical students.  They were asked two different questions: first, under what circumstances should abortion be allowed under law; and, second, if they agreed that women who had abortions outside the law should be imprisoned.  The research concluded that Brazilians have different views on when abortion should be legal, but most do not agree with imprisoning women for abortion.  Hence I urge parliamentarians, the newspapers and the public to take that into consideration and ask the question as to whether they would wish to imprison women who procure abortion.  A law that allows abortion for only certain minimum grounds mandates the imprisonment of women who have abortions under all other grounds.  I think members would find that this is not what the public wants, neither in law nor in practice.<br\/><br\/>I shall now give my views on the specific health issues that were raised in the Citizens' Assembly report and other health issues that were not raised but are of relevance to the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  First, abortion is life saving in certain health conditions, for example, a mother with chorioamnionitis and severe sepsis, pre-existing severe heart disease, and poor mental health and a threat to commit suicide.  There are examples of such incidents from the Republic of Ireland.  Deaths from these conditions occur due to the difficulty in assessing that the seriousness of the condition meets the legal criteria of &quot;real and substantial risk&quot; that can only be averted by ending the pregnancy, and the fear of legal punishment that prevents a doctor from taking a firm and early decision.<br\/><br\/>Abortion in certain health conditions will avoid deterioration of health, for example, cardiac, renal, and neurological conditions.  We could formulate a list of conditions but we will not be able to cover all the different conditions and combinations of conditions that we encounter as clinicians.  Each mother needs to be individually assessed as to whether the condition is serious enough to terminate a pregnancy.  Such lists are used in certain countries where restrictive abortion laws operate.  However, mothers slip through the net and end up with worse organ damage.  A list of the medical conditions that are considered serious enough to terminate a pregnancy in Peru include hyperemesis gravidarum refractory to treatment with severe hepatic and-or renal impairment; malignant neoplasm requiring surgical treatment, radiotherapy and-or chemotherapy; functional class III or IV cardiac failure; severe chronic arterial hypertension and evidence of organ damage; systemic lupus erythematosus with severe renal damage refractory to treatment; advanced diabetes mellitus with vital organ damage; and severe respiratory failure demonstrated by certain parameters.  The Peruvian document is included in the references.<br\/><br\/>The errors due to conservative management of continuation of pregnancy compromise the mother's health with further deterioration of organ function that leads to shorter life span and at times death.  Such incidents are greater in the countries with restrictive abortion laws and are due to fears by the doctors of facing legal action.  An article showing an example of such deterioration involving a cardiac condition is included in the references.<br\/><br\/>Abortion under optimal conditions has less maternal mortality in developed countries compared with continuation of pregnancy.  It is 0.7 per 100,0000 with safe abortion care compared with ten per 100,0000 with continuation of pregnancy.  These are due to life threatening complications such as thromboembolism, hypertensive disease, postpartum haemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, and so forth as referenced in WHO document.<br\/><br\/>In the United Kingdom, approximately 190,000 abortions are carried out each year and there were only two recorded maternal deaths in the five years from 2012 to 2016.  The statistics of UK abortions are referenced.  The clear majority of abortions were done under clause C, that is, that &quot;the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risks greater than if the pregnancy were terminated&quot; of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman mainly on grounds of further deterioration of mental health.<br\/><br\/>Abortion is not associated with physical or mental health hazards to the mother and it has no impact on future pregnancies.  This has been made clear by the statement of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and is included in appendix 1.<br\/><br\/>Abortion should be permitted for lethal foetal malformation and severe congenital malformation that may have a major impact on life.  This is also the position of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist and is included in appendix 2.<br\/><br\/>Safe abortion care should be consider as a public health and human rights issue.  Despite good contraceptive coverage, about 10% of women get pregnant and seek abortion.  In countries where abortion is legalised, the total abortion rates and maternal mortality have declined due to safe post-abortion care and post-abortion contraception.<br\/><br\/>Making abortion illegal has not stopped illegal abortion for centuries and in different countries.  It increases maternal mortality, and this is referenced.  About 4,800 women in Ireland have their abortions done in the United Kingdom.  These are the reduced figures as the numbers have reduced by 20% in the past year or so due to availability of medication by post for self-procuring abortion.  These have their own complications.<br\/><br\/>Abortion is a sexual and reproductive rights issue and the decision should be made by individual women after adequate information is given.  If abortion is not made legal, it will promote illegal abortion.  Those women with influence and financial resources will get it performed in a safe environment.  Those who are poor with less influence will resort to unsafe abortions.  This would be a social injustice.<br\/><br\/>I shall conclude with a few extracts from some of the world bodies.  The WHO states that &quot;abortions and the high maternal and child mortality rates constitute a serious public health problem in many countries&quot;.  It continues:<\/p><blockquote>Criminal laws penalising and restricting induced abortion are the paradigmatic examples of impermissible barriers to the realisation of women's right to health and must be eliminated.  These laws infringe women's dignity and autonomy by severely restricting decision-making by women in respect of their sexual and reproductive health.<\/blockquote><p>The report of the UN special rapporteur on the right to health to the UN General Assembly in 2011 stated:  &quot;Certain criminal laws effectively shift the burden of realising the right to health away from States onto pregnant women, punishing women for the lack of effective provision of health-care goods, services and education by the Government.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Ireland can and should provide first class sexual and reproductive health based on rights and public health perspectives.  There are minimal ill effects to health with a well-informed safe abortion.  This is from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, appendix 4.  Health advantages of avoiding or not having unwanted pregnancy need to be considered in addition to specific socio-cultural issues faced by the women.<br\/><br\/>The excellent maternal mortality rates in Ireland as number six in the world may become 20th or 40th in the world if legal access to abortion is denied to the 4,800 women who may not be able to go to the United Kingdom, but may procure illegal abortions.  At any cost, we must avoid having illegal abortion.

My opening statement is a summary of the longer position paper, which I also supplied to the committee.  The content of this statement is rooted in over four decades of the practising of obstetrics, caring for women in Ireland, London and the United States.<\/p><p>I hope to assist the committee in its deliberations.<br\/><br\/>I am currently chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Ireland.  I was master of the National Maternity Hospital from 1991 to 1997 and clinical director from 2008-2014.  In 2012-13, I served as a member of the committee of independent experts which advised the Government on the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in respect of the X case.  The outcome was the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  In 2013 I was the independent expert witness for the coroner in the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar.  In 2014 I was an expert witness for the family in the case of Miss P <i>v<\/i>HSE in the High Court.<br\/><br\/>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Ireland has not been asked to provide a position paper.  However, in preparation for this hearing, I canvassed the opinions of members and have incorporated feedback received into this statement.<br\/><br\/>When put to the vote, the majority of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly voted against maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>of the eighth amendment.  By a substantial majority the assembly voted in favour of legalising termination when a woman&rsquo;s life or health is at risk, when pregnancy follows rape, in cases of foetal abnormality, for socioeconomic reasons, or without restriction.<br\/><br\/>The assembly also made five ancillary recommendations, including those relating to improvements in sexual health and relationship education; access to early scanning and testing in pregnancy; counselling services; and that consideration should be given to who will fund and carry out terminations.  I support the ancillary recommendations without reservation.  On the fifth ancillary recommendation, it is my opinion that if termination is legalised it should be funded by the State, rather than delegated to private agencies.  All terminations should be medically supervised.  Medical personnel with a conscientious objection should be excused from involvement.<br\/><br\/>Article 40.3.3&deg; gives rise to significant difficulties for doctors practising in Ireland and has caused grave harm to women, including death.  The two outstanding examples of which I have direct personal experience are the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 and the case of Miss P in December 2014.  These are only two examples of cases where doctors in Ireland continue to be put in the inappropriate position of having to interpret the Constitution in the course of caring for sick women.  Medical personnel have no difficulties in obeying clear legislation and medical regulations, but we are not trained for the complexities of constitutional interpretation, nor should we reasonably be expected to be.<br\/><br\/>The eighth amendment has given rise to legal cases including the X case; the C case; A, B and C; D <i>v<\/i>Ireland; the Miss D case; A, B, and C <i>v<\/i>Ireland; Miss Y; Mellet <i>v<\/i>Ireland; and Whelan <i>v<\/i>Ireland.  These are the difficult and painful cases of Irish women and girls who have had to resort to stressful legal processes in the absence of comprehensive legislation on abortion.  If the eighth amendment is not repealed, this list will continue to grow and Ireland will continue to be censured by international bodies such as the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations.<br\/><br\/>Currently, termination of pregnancy on grounds other than risk to the life of the woman is subject to criminal prosecution with the penalty of imprisonment for up to 14 years for women and their doctors, while simultaneously the 13th amendment provides constitutional protection for women to travel to obtain a termination outside the State and the 14th amendment protects the right to access information necessary to achieve this.  This is profoundly hypocritical.  Our Constitution enshrines a woman&rsquo;s right to commit an act which is a criminal offence in her own country, as long as it is committed outside the State.  By any yardstick this is a bizarre situation.  Testimony from numerous Irish women demonstrates the pain and stress they have undergone and continue to experience as a result of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing failure to legislate comprehensively.  Members of the committee should not underestimate the anger felt by women who have to travel abroad for termination of pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>In my longer position paper, I have included an analysis of EU legislation.  Some 99% of women in the EU live in countries where their legislatures have grasped the nettle of legislating for termination of pregnancy.  No doubt many other EU countries have had difficulties with the subject, given their own religious, political and social histories, but their legislators have had the will to deal with the issue.  The Irish position remains deeply anomalous and obviously politically contentious.  In the matter of women&rsquo;s reproductive health, we remain outliers in a tiny minority in Europe.<br\/><br\/>Legal provision in the EU for termination of pregnancy is as follows.  In the case of risk to the life of the mother it is provided for in all countries except Malta.  In the case of risk to the health of the mother it is provided for in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination for pregnancy as a consequence of rape is available in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination in the case of foetal abnormality is available in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination for medical reasons beyond 12 weeks, which varies by country, is available in all countries except Malta, Ireland and Poland to a varying degree.<br\/><br\/>I suggest that in 2017 the eighth amendment is unworkable.  When it was enacted 34 years ago, neither the worldwide web nor the abortion pill had been invented.  The committee heard evidence last week that the rate of women accessing the abortion pill from online service providers is increasing.  In reality, there are many services that facilitate people living here with a means of securing delivery to a designated address, which means they access items such as abortion pills.  While importation of these pills into Ireland is illegal, in another bizarre twist which mirrors the contortions of the Constitution, An Post offers customers a virtual UK address to use as their shipping address via the <i>addresspal.ie<\/i>service.<br\/><br\/>The genie is therefore out of the bottle in respect of online access to the abortion pill.  The grave concern that we, doctors, have as a consequence of this reality is the potential for harm caused by the use of unregulated medication by Irish women and girls.  I believe it is a matter of priority for the Oireachtas to address the reality of this situation.<br\/><br\/>The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly vote clearly recommends that the Oireachtas deal with the question of termination by legislation rather than through the Constitution.  I entirely concur with this conclusion, but I would add that legislation needs to be supported by regulation with regard to clinics and hospitals, and by the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais.<br\/><br\/>The question of viability needs to be addressed in the practical implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  In Ireland, viability is currently considered to occur at approximately 24 weeks' gestation.  When obstetricians deliver a baby at the margins of viability, it is standard practice in this country to have a full neonatal team present at the birth to make an immediate assessment about viability and institute intensive care in every case where appropriate.  I cannot envisage a scenario whereby any doctor in Ireland would support any proposal that termination of pregnancy would be contemplated beyond 23 weeks.  I hope this is reassuring to the committee in respect of the uninformed discussion that regrettably occurs in respect of so-called &quot;late-term abortion&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Medical termination is performed by the administration of two medications.  Mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary to support pregnancy before the placenta develops and misoprostol makes the uterus contract.  Taken in combination two or three days apart, these tablets have a success rate greater than 90% if taken in the first trimester, preferably before ten weeks.  The first tablet is taken in a clinic or doctor's surgery and the second is taken at home.  The woman then experiences symptoms the same as a miscarriage.  The rate of side effects is extremely low.<br\/><br\/>For pregnancies of later gestation the procedure needs to take place in the hospital setting and will require more medication over a longer period of time.  If the Oireachtas legislates to allow termination, it is likely that later terminations will only be legalised for reasons other than socioeconomic or without restriction.  Surgical termination is where the contents of the uterus are removed either by suction or curettage following dilatation of the cervix.<br\/><br\/>The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 deals with the question of termination of pregnancy in circumstances where there is a threat to the life of the mother, including by suicide.  In the years in which it has been in force there have been approximately 25 terminations each year.  A major difficulty with this Act is that it is entirely the responsibility of doctors to determine how close to death, or how sick, a woman must be before legal termination can be performed.  The woman herself has no input into the decision, other than the option of refusing termination and placing her life at risk.  Doctors are subject to criminal prosecution if it can be established that they acted in bad faith in recommending a termination, even if the woman herself is happy with the decision.<br\/><br\/>Serious risk to the physical or mental health of the woman overlaps with threat to the life of the mother in so far as a risk to health may develop into a risk to life.  Under current legislation doctors have to make judgment calls as to when a risk to health becomes a risk to life.  If the judgment is wrong, either the mother will die or the doctor will be guilty of committing a criminal offence.<br\/><br\/>Risk to the health of the mother, either physical or mental, raises the important question of how different people deal with risk.  Some women, perhaps those expecting a much longed-for first baby, are willing to accept any risk in order to have a baby, while for others, perhaps those with small children at home, the deterioration in their health represents an unacceptable risk.  In these complex circumstances, a decision to terminate is best left to the woman and her doctor.<br\/><br\/>Pregnancy as a result of rape could be dealt with in a straightforward way by legislating for the legal prescription of the abortion pill which I have previously described.  Pregnancy tests are now so sensitive that they are positive just before a missed period and so the pills would be 99% successful if taken within the first eight weeks.<\/p><p>There is no diagnostic test to confirm rape, so I strongly recommend that a woman who has undergone the trauma of rape should not be forced to \"prove\" rape if she chooses to terminate a resulting pregnancy.  Women should be taken at their word - hardly a revolutionary concept.<\/p><p> Foetal abnormality likely to result in death either before or soon after birth of the baby was covered in detail in evidence last week from the masters of the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospital.  They both outlined the clinical risks associated with current legislation.  For those who continue with the pregnancy, hospice care for the newborn with little or no chance of survival outside the womb has, in my experience, been a long-standing practice in this country in our hospitals.  It is simply incorrect to state that this care is not available.  I have considerable personal experience of couples that have had the misfortune of receiving diagnoses of foetal abnormalities.  In some cases, the parents have chosen to continue with the pregnancy and have been much comforted by having some time, however brief, with their baby.  In other cases, couples have been unable to continue with the pregnancy and have travelled abroad for termination.  However, what is not so well understood is that some couples experience a diagnosis of foetal abnormality on subsequent pregnancies - in other words, twice or more.  My experience has been that in the vast majority of these sad cases, on the second or subsequent occasions the couples choose termination, even if they had elected to continue with the pregnancy on the first occasion.  I also have experience of couples who, prior to screening for an abnormality, declare confidently that they would not seek termination in the event of a serious abnormality being diagnosed, only to change their minds when confronted with the reality of serious foetal abnormality.  I think most people in Ireland would sympathise with this.<\/p><p> Significant foetal abnormality unlikely to result in death before or shortly after birth raises more difficult questions.  In particular, how can we define \"significant\" abnormality?  Antenatal diagnosis, including ultrasound, genetic testing and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is now much more sophisticated than in the past.  When the eighth amendment was enacted, this level of diagnostic capability was not available.  The \"significance\" of the abnormality may depend on the extent of the disability and-or parents' ability to cope with the consequences.  In some conditions, particularly genetic ones, there is a wide spectrum of severity.  Parents, in consultation with their doctor, are the people best able to make decisions in their individual circumstances.  Diagnosis of genetic abnormalities can now be made before 12 weeks' gestation by a blood test, confirmed by either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.<\/p><p> I now come to termination for socio-economic reasons, or without restriction.  As I have said, throughout the European Union, 99% of women have access to termination of pregnancy without restriction up to ten weeks of pregnancy.  The remaining 1% are those women who live in either Ireland or Malta.  Of course, the majority of these women live in Ireland.  The method used in these cases is medication, which, as we know, is increasingly used by women in Ireland.  Of the citizens who voted for termination without restriction, 92% voted to limit gestation to 12 weeks.<\/p><p> It is well documented that in countries where abortion is banned, the rate of women dying remains high.  Approximately 70,000 women die each year from complications relating to unsafe abortion.  The committee heard testimony last week from Dr. Abigail Aiken that Irish women today are attempting self-abortion with potentially fatal consequences.  It is equally well documented that countries with liberal laws and easy access to contraception have lower rates of abortion than those with restrictive laws.  Women in Ireland with financial resources have access to termination of pregnancy, primarily in the UK.  However, women who are poor, in the care of the State or refugees, for example, do not have such access.  The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution are of no assistance to these women.  Without access to abortion in the UK, it is inevitable that Ireland would have an epidemic of illegal abortions and a massive increase in maternal mortality.  If Ireland were to enact legislation in line with EU consensus, including termination without restriction up to ten weeks, our law would be among the most conservative in Europe but would deal with the vast majority of circumstances in which women currently access services outside the State.  I believe that the forthcoming referendum on the eighth amendment should put a simple binary question to the electorate for or against repeal.  Legislation is the responsibility of the Oireachtas, not the people.  On repeal of the eighth amendment, Irish law on termination of pregnancy would continue to be governed by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and there would be no legislative vacuum pending further legislation.  In the meantime, women in Ireland will continue to access services in the UK or elsewhere in Europe, or access abortion pills illegally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Boylan for his opening statement.

I am a practising consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist in Mayo University Hospital, Castlebar.  I am national speciality director for basic speciality postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology in the institute.  I am dean of medical education at Mayo Medical Academy, Castlebar, a teaching academy of the School of Medicine, NUI Galway.  My clinical and teaching practice encompasses general obstetrics and gynaecology in the rural, non-tertiary setting in Ireland and an interest in global maternal-reproductive health and development.<\/p> <p>  As requested in the invitation to today's proceedings, the comments I will make refer to the issues that may arise if the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment are adopted in part or in whole by Irish society.  My status is as a witness from a professional body whose membership replicates the diverse views of Irish society.  The institute does not have, nor should it purport to have, a common stance.  These comments are my opinions, except where otherwise noted, informed by the views of members who wished to contribute and wished to be clear about the status of the presenters today.  The complex and often conflicting elements that inform discussions on termination of pregnancy cannot be disaggregated, although they need to be studied as separate entities for the sequential programme of work that this committee is undertaking with diligence.  The work of this committee on the matter of the eighth amendment requires consideration of the guiding principles of ethics and human rights balanced by the right to national and individual self-determination.<\/p> <p>  Globally, maternal-reproductive health outcomes are one measure of effective civil society and government partnership.  In high-income settings, sub-national adverse outcomes are often concealed if the metrics used are the rare frequency of mortality over the common frequency of physical and psychological morbidity.  Globally, restrictive termination of pregnancy legislation contributes to maternal mortality and significant morbidity disproportionately in vulnerable women and girls, as supported by the witnesses from the World Health Organization, WHO, last week and today's witnesses.  While I speak as a health professional in active clinical practice, I wish to re-emphasise the inter-sectoral and social determinants on quality reproductive health outcome as included in the first two ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Outside the scope of today's meeting, Members of the Oireachtas may consider their ability to influence the wider development of reproductive health care when deliberating over connected interventions that are delivered in the sectors of education, social welfare, youth development and finance.<\/p> <p>  If the introduction of a woman and girl centred safe termination service is the desire of the Irish electorate, it should be considered as just one element of a comprehensive reproductive health programme.  Engagement with women and girls and men and boys is required to develop formal and informal reproductive health education programmes, strengthen peer education as a delivery method for life skills learning and develop responsive, acceptable, affordable and locally accessible services while also facilitating the bypassing of local services, especially in rural areas, where anonymity and distance from home may be preferred.  Delays and barriers in access to safe reproductive health services, including termination of pregnancy, are influenced by distance, institutional reception, cost and bypass behaviours.<\/p> <p>  Health care workers in women's health in Ireland are guided by the legislative framework of the country, the professional standards of the registration authorities, their professional bodies and their personal value systems, whether conscious or unconscious.  Obstetricians and gynaecologists in Ireland to date, whether specialists or postgraduate trainees, have not been systematically studied to explore their position on the specific items on which the members of the Citizens' Assembly have been balloted.  The process to secure professional readiness to respond to possible legislative change has not yet been determined.  It is not known if the views of the women's health professionals will reflect the results of the Citizens' Assembly ballot.  Many clinical providers in Ireland in women's health have trained or completed some part of their training in other countries where termination of pregnancy is lawful.  Some of those providers would have already explored their personal ethical decision-making pathways.  For some, new legislation would involve the unlearning of restrictive practices in providing health care in Ireland at this time.  However, for the majority of clinical providers in this country, the possible enactment of lawful termination of pregnancy in Ireland may lead to individual professional moral distress for the first time.<\/p><p>Training needs also include cultural and diversity competence, unconscious bias awareness and the development of a national framework for ethical decision-making.  Care, support and sensitive leadership within the professions to deliver a new service following ethical decision-making is required.  Societal care, support and avoidance of alienation of health care workers during such transformative change is also required. <\/p><p> Regarding health systems, if in due course there is legislative change, the new system would be commissioned and provided.  Regulatory codes of practice would be revised and the professional bodies would review their competence standards, training curricula and assessment tools.  Quality assurance and suitable designation of centres that provide termination of pregnancy would be required.  Centres may include certain primary care services, family planning and sexual health clinics, infectious disease clinics, maternity units, and general hospitals with gynaecology and sexual assault treatment units.  The logistical challenges are those faced in the development of any new health service.  The process would involve a multi-dimensional approach, including biomedical health system strengthening, informal health system strengthening, and engagement with women and families in addition to the actual service development.<\/p><p> The skill set for the medical and safe surgical procedures in relation to termination of pregnancy already exist in obstetrics and gynaecology and women&rsquo;s health services in Ireland.  Some exist in the primary care setting as discussed by the ICGP witnesses last week and some exist in the early pregnancy care units and the tertiary maternal foetal medicine units throughout the country.  The training and service expansion needs are in the domains of professionalism, communication, inter-sectoral and inter-professional team work.<\/p><p> Conscientious objection would be facilitated for all cadres of health care staff.  This may result in logistical problems in the smaller rural centres, especially as there are already existing rota gaps, a mismatch in the urban-rural distribution of doctors, nurses and midwives, and a dependency on agency workers.  One third of obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives in Ireland work in the smaller centres with significant dependence on international medical graduates to provide specialist obstetrics and gynaecology services.  There is the mixed challenge of providing continuity of services with unstable manpower in some disciplines and also overly stable workforce in other disciplines, where the introduction of change is less common.  Of importance for the smaller centres is the agreed tertiary pathways for complex care with agreed automatic acceptance protocols for maternal transfer, whether it is an emergency or elective case in nature.  Conscientious objection may also compound the problems of recruitment to the relevant disciplines, the attrition of trainees and retention of older providers in the specialties during a period of transformative change.  We do not yet know the unknowns in this subject area.<\/p><p> There has been significant initiation of organisational development in women and infants' programming in Ireland at national level in the past decade, sadly in many instances in response to unacceptable adverse outcome.  Women&rsquo;s advocacy and advisory contributions, national governance, regulatory standards, guideline development and implementation, hospital group structure, managed clinical networks, HSE clinical programmes, primary care teams, the frameworks for quality and the National Office of Clinical Audit have contributed to progressive system strengthening in both urban and rural women&rsquo;s health care provision.  All these developments provide a degree of organisational preparedness for the introduction of an expanded reproductive health service, if required to do so by the Irish people.  However, by international and OECD standards, the women&rsquo;s health service continues to be considerably under-resourced, fragmented and, in public opinion, as surveyed in the preparation of the first National Maternity Strategy 2016, is not yet considered to be woman and family centred or woman led.<\/p><p> My final comments reflect individual notes from institute members.  In other jurisdictions, initial restrictive termination law has evolved into more liberal practice.  Members have noted that overly prescriptive categorisation of foetal anomaly may prevent the evolution of matching options with health technology advancement.  They recommend that the detail is provided for in the initial legislation and subsequent regulation rather than by constitutional amendment.  Some gynaecologists have expressed potential personal moral distress at the dual challenge of providing extraordinary life-saving interventions for one foetus or infant at borderline viability while also providing foeticide for a potentially normal foetus at the same gestation.  Those members who wished to contribute gave general support for the provision of termination for fatal foetal anomalies.  Some members view the current law as excessively restrictive for crisis pregnancy.

Is there such a thing as a gradation of risk such as serious risk and grave risk?  Those are the types of terminologies we are using and indeed that the Citizens' Assembly used, but I am not sure if they are legal terminologies or if they translate easily or at all into a medical setting.

We have discussed this at the health committee.  Is it the witnesses' contention that we would need to see significant investment in capital or in people?  Do we have the buildings, and we just need to put the people in them?  Do we have the people and do they need additional training?

There are problems in trying to categorise because risk is a continuous process.  What can start as a little bit of risk can be a medium risk or a high risk within minutes to hours.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is sometimes dangerous in acute conditions to classify risk.  A typical example is Savita Halappanavar.  In her case, sepsis became severe sepsis and then septic shock within hours, so it is difficult.  To take other conditions, for example, if the mother has renal disease or cardiac disease, that again can change very rapidly.  What we might think of as a minor risk or mild risk in a renal condition, if she gets superimposed preeclampsia or hypertensive disease, it can suddenly become moderate to severe.  The risk is something we can sometimes predict but we cannot judge, especially in pregnancy, because of rapidly changing sequences.

In the context of pregnancy, which is a very dynamic process where risk can change and the disease process can deteriorate very rapidly, women will approach risk in a different way.  I think it is important to take women's viewpoints into consideration when we are dealing with them in the management of pregnancy - it is their lives that are at risk.  Some women will risk anything to have a baby.  For other women, for example, a woman who is 40 years of age and has four young children at home, who has diabetes which is deteriorating, and who finds herself pregnant and knows that if she continues with the pregnancy, her diabetes will get worse, her eyesight might be affected and her kidneys might deteriorate and so on, for her, that is not an acceptable risk.  For a woman in her first pregnancy after, say, years of IVF, she may well be willing to accept that risk.  So, while we can describe risk as low, middle and high, it is the woman's interpretation of what the risk is to her personally that is critically important in how we deal with women who are pregnant, and that side of it really has to be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Boylan"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Does Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in wish to come in on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#J00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In some situations it is possible to provide some likelihood.

Women are involved in these discussions the whole way through, but the problem with the current legislation is that it is up to the doctors to make a decision and then to advise the woman that her life is at risk and she needs a termination of pregnancy to minimise that risk or remove the risk.  However, it is a fine line.  The only way one can find out whether one has made the right decision is not to do a termination and, if the woman dies, one has made the wrong decision.

Women may choose to opt out of life-saving procedures when their life is at serious risk if they have the capacity to do so.

That process of information, education and communication with the woman starts from the time we are giving the diagnosis.  It is a process over time.  It is not a single act.  While the witnesses have advised that there may be uncertainty, the timeline to advancing to more serious signs of infection, what we call sepsis, and then to times where the mortality rate significantly goes up, what we call septic shock, are very variable among women.

As the gestation period increases, so do the complications and so on go up and illegal abortion comes to the fore when she is in the later period of gestation and runs into difficulties.

We think we have our positions when we come in here but we realise how much we do not know.  I thank the witnesses for their expertise.  Some of my questions have been touched on, in particular by Senator Gavan's last question.  I am conscious we are coming up to the anniversary of Savita Halappanavar's death.  It is easy for us, as we are not her family, friends or people who knew her, to keep hearing her name.  However, it is important to ask the question while being sensitive of the impact it could have for people who are watching proceedings.  Dr. Boylan said that Savita would still be alive today if she had been given an abortion when she first requested it.  This is contested in some quarters by those who claim she died as a result of sepsis due to an inevitable miscarriage.  Perhaps my question is for Professor Arulkumaran and Dr. Boylan because they were aware of the case and involved in the inquest.  Do they believe the presence of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution cost Savita her life?  There have been claims that the eighth amendment saves lives but we very rarely look at the lives it has cost.<\/p> <p>  My other question is to all three witnesses and is about the socioeconomic grounds.  Sometimes it is seen as a ground in isolation.  In women from low socioeconomic backgrounds there is an intrinsic link between their background and poor health.  How can we begin to look at those two together instead of separately?  There is a connection between socioeconomic status and the overall health and well-being of women from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds.  When assessing the risk to health or life of a pregnant woman, are any social indicators taken into account in that assessment and, if not, should they be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#N01800","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I will start with Savita's case.  It was very clear to me during the inquiry that the thing preventing the physician from proceeding was the legal issue because she repeatedly said she was concerned about the legal issue.  I will give a little bit of explanation.  The mother was sick.  There was no question about that.  Even at the last minute they were using a hand probe to see whether the baby's heartbeat was present or not.  Any junior doctor would have said it was a serious condition and they must terminate.   They were just keeping her going because of the mere fact the heartbeat was there.  The legislation played a major role in making a decision.  Somebody else might say they would have done the termination much earlier.  That is a personal interpretation.  It is why things are made difficult because of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the second question on the socioeconomic situation, one has to look at each individual mother's case separately.  One mother might be a single mother and might have difficulty in managing or feeding the children.  Another might have been using contraception or experiencing physical or other abuse by the husband.  As medical physicians, we have to take the socioeconomic background into consideration when a mother makes a request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#N01900","nonspeaker":"Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Savita died from sepsis and septic shock.

We are discussing health and risk to health, but \"health\" is broader than \"medical reasons\".  As to the use of the word \"doctor\", there may in time be task shifting to other cadres of specialist staff who come from a nursing or midwifery background.  \"Clinician-woman relationship\" is the broader interpretation of the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  It is not possible to be proscriptive on every indication as to why a woman or girl may request a termination.  The commonest reasons where there are liberal laws are that the pregnancy is not affordable for her at this time or her other responsibilities would be compromised at this time, for example, the impact on other people for whom she is responsible.  If we become restrictive as regards purely clinical indications of physical and mental health, which is what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended, we will miss the other social determinants of health and well-being that influence women's decisions to seek termination of pregnancy and we may not legislate for those women who are currently self-terminating for what we may not consider to be socioeconomic or medical reasons.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on model 3 hospitals, a safe termination of pregnancy is part of what is considered basic emergency obstetric care.  Centres of excellence have an important role in termination care where the woman has complex medical disorders or the foetal complexity may prove difficult to manage in a rural hospital setting that is in a model 3 unit.  There is still one unit in a model 2 hospital.  Occasionally, there will be reasons to attend a tertiary unit where there is a maternal foetal medicine specialist practising with a full multidisciplinary team.

Everyone present is aware of it and the appalling vista that it presented.  The doctors were unable to make a decision as to whether they could turn off her life support because of the presence of a foetal heartbeat.  That is the best example.  In terms of day-to-day practice, the issue would not arise on a daily basis.  In a busy unit like a tertiary referral centre, however, it would be an issue and people would wonder whether it was legal to provide a termination in a particular case.<\/p> <p>  Another problem is that cases going to the European Court of Human Rights makes the eighth amendment difficult on the ground for practising staff.<\/p> <p>  The best outcome is the interaction between the patient and the health care professional.  There is no question about that.  No two situations are identical and many nuances are involved in all scenarios.  Some people have different attitudes towards risk, for example.  All of these factors need to be taken into consideration.  The best person to make those considerations is the patient with her health care professional.<\/p> <p>  Twenty-three weeks and on is where foetal viability is now regarded as a practical proposition.  Many of those survivors at 23 weeks will have significant disabilities, for example, cerebral palsy and blindness, and be completely dependent for the rest of their lives.  It is not that everything is fine at 23 weeks - it is not like that at all - but if a baby is born at 23 weeks, physicians in Ireland will do everything to care for that baby.  For example, if we have a woman with a severe condition who is at 23 and a half weeks with twins and we tell her that she is really sick and we need to deliver her, and if she asks us to do everything to save the babies, we will perform a caesarean section and intervene in the best interests of those babies.  That is theoretically a termination of pregnancy, but we will in fact do everything to look after those babies when they are born.  It is not a simple situation and viability changes.  When I was in training, a baby born at 28 weeks had little chance of survival.  The situation is improving all of the time with intensive neonatal care, advances, research and so on.

Would the removal of that distinction tidy up that matter?<\/p> <p>  We hear a lot that Ireland is a safe place to give birth.  Is it not the case that many of the countries that are better than us have quite a liberal abortion regime and it is not, therefore, an argument that because we do not have abortion in Ireland we have safe maternity care?  The countries rated higher than Ireland have a liberal abortion regime.  Perhaps the delegates would elaborate on how that is linked to our ability to access abortion services in Britain.<\/p> <p>  I would like to discuss the abortion pill, which ties into the area of resources.  Last week, the head of obstetrics and gynaecology in the UK said that in her opinion the legislation in the UK needs to be changed to allow nurses and midwives to make the abortion pill available.  They currently make this medication available in cases of missed miscarriages and they carry out vacuum aspiration.  Is this not a way in which to deal with a resources issue?  As this is an approved medical pill that is certified in Ireland, why cannot it be administered in a GP's office by a nurse?  Given the number of people who access it in the first trimester there is no real resources required.  Perhaps this could be teased out further.<\/p> <p>  On consent, is it not the case that whereas normally the patient dictates his or her treatment, the woman's ability to consent, because of the eighth amendment, is diminished?  I am thinking particularly in cases of people who are happy to parent but were brought to court because they did not want a caesarean section, it was deemed that the life of the unborn was threatened by their decision and, therefore, an action was taken to cut across their opinion.<\/p><p>I apologise for throwing these issues in together, but will the delegates address the points made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#P01600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I will start with Savita's case which was very clear.  There are certain conditions in which a disease can escalate steeply and there is no time.  By the time the condition is recognised one has missed the boat.  For example, the maternal mortality rate in cases of severe sepsis is between 20% and 40%.  If the mother develops septic shock, the figure rises to 60%.  For every hour treatment is delayed, the chances of maternal mortality occurring rise by 6%.  There is no time to waste and a clinician must recognise that the mother is going into septic shock, has a fever and a high pulse rate.  However, because there is a heartbeat the clinician starts to dilly-dally.  There is no question that the medical practitioner should be given the opportunity to act.<\/p> <p>  The second question was about the dispensing of tablets by nurses, pharmacists and so on.  The crucial issue in liberalising termination is that it must come under regulation.  As Dr. Boylan mentioned, it must come within the remit of a medical council, or a nursing council if nurses are to be allowed to dispense.  The most important point is that the patient be registered with some clinical medical professional, whether it be a nurse, a midwife or a doctor, who could say the patient was at such a gestation period and that such a medication had been given.  This person should give a telephone number to the patient in order that she could call if she was to experience fever, have a high pulse rate or bleeding in order that she could make immediate contact.  There is no medical procedure without risk.  The moment the patient feels something is wrong, she should be able to ring and gain access to health services in order that it can be managed.  There are a number of countries which allow nursing and midwifery professionals to prescribe and administer the drug, but they always have communication and a centre which can deal with complications should they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>An ordinary GP would be such an avenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#Q00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>A GP would be fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The removal of the distinction between health and the risk of death would certainly be very helpful in assisting women and their doctors to reach a decision.  Ireland is a very safe place in which to give birth, but it is not the safest in the world.  The margins are quite small, but it is a very safe place in which to give birth.  However, if we did not have access to the United Kingdom, our maternal mortality rate would shoot up because women would access unsafe illegal back-street abortion services.  That is undeniable.  The best example is Romania when Ceauescu came to power, on which I have provided information in my position paper.<\/p> <p>  There is a nurse practitioner programme which allows nurses and midwives to gain prescribing skills.  That happens in maternity units nowadays.  As Professor Arulkumaran said, it is important that they have backup and a telephone number and so on.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of consent, the Deputy mentioned forced caesarean sections because of a concern about the condition of the baby.  That is very rare.  It does happen, but it is extremely rare and I am not really sure what the eight amendment has to do with that issue.  It is more about a clinician's concern about a woman's capacity to make the decision to continue a pregnancy.

In terms of Professor Arulkmaran's opening statement, it really depends on whatever question one asks.  What I am asking here is what we are trying to achieve.  If we are trying to achieve something that is politically palatable or palatable to the wider public who, for some reason, people within these Houses seem to think are not engaged in this process, then we are going down the right road in this committee.  We are trying to deal with the issue of the almost 5,000 women travelling to the UK.  I was on a flight home from the UK last week and as I walked up the aisle, I wondered who on the plane was travelling back.<\/p> <p>  What we should be trying to achieve at this committee is the provision of appropriate maternity care for the women of this country without fear of political consequences for our own careers.  We should be doing our job as legislators and we need to be brave here.  <\/p> <p>  We have listened to many experts in the past few weeks, including the witnesses before us today but we keep talking about women as if women are some sort of abstract concept.  I am one of those women.  When I present myself in the Coombe Hospital to have a baby, I have a reasonable expectation that I will come out the other side alive and that my children will not be left without me.  Professor Boylan said that the maternity strategy does not have women at its centre.  If women are not at the centre of the maternity strategy, as we discussed at the Committee on Health, then where are we going in this country?  There is this idea that we cannot trust women in this country with their own medical decisions.  I totally agree with the Professor that risk depends on where one is in one's life.  If I am told at 42 - in a few years time - that I have a high-risk pregnancy, I am not going to risk not coming out the other side but if I was 42 and having my first child, that would be a completely different decision.  As one of the witnesses said, the individual nuances of cases present grey areas.  I think it was Professor Boylan who said that but I might be attributing it to the wrong person.  This has been made clear to the committee and those who are ignoring it are just putting their heads in the sand.  We cannot allow for every permutation of every gestational development, every kidney function, every liver function or heart function of every individual and come up with some sort of formula whereby we, in here, allow women to do X, Y or Z with their lives.  <\/p> <p>  I am getting frustrated at this stage.

I thank the witnesses.  I have read the presentation Professor Arulkumaran made to the Citizens' Assembly.  Clearly women can go to Britain.  We have abortion, but it happens to be in Britain.  The professor presented figures from South Africa showing a 91% decrease in deaths from unsafe abortions when it was legalised.  Yesterday I attended the launch of the UN report on the Sustainable Development Goals.  The reality of women who die on the African Continent because they do not have access to a place like Britain is very stark.<\/p> <p>  Professor Arulkumaran presented graphs showing the reduction in abortions after legalisation in France, Italy and Turkey.  I ask him to outline the reduction in abortion following legalisation so that we can be clear that we are talking about either unsafe abortions or legal abortions.<\/p> <p>  Several people have referred to the anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar and the sensitivity and difficulty for her family.  Senator Mullen - I am sorry he is not here - referred to another woman who died.  The witness did not have time to respond to the question because he had gone over his time.  Is that the same woman referred to last week by the master of the Rotunda Hospital?  If it was, it was a very different interpretation of why that woman died.  I will give the witness more time to respond to that issue raised by Senator Mullen.  His statement as to the reason that woman died does not seem to be true.<\/p> <p>  My final question is to Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in and perhaps to Dr. Boylan.  Deputy Naughton asked about training and systems, and people having conscientious objections.  When representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners appeared before the committee, they made it clear that somebody with a conscientious objection has an obligation to refer the case to somebody who does not who will deal with the issue.  Is that the same for obstetrics and gynaecology?  If so what would be the practice whereby somebody in a hospital in the west of Ireland or the mid-west in my case can be certain that they will have access to the care they require irrespective of the geography?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#S00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508330400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I am not familiar with the details of the woman who died in London that Professor Malone mentioned.

Not all termination services will occur in the hospital sector.  In time if abortion is liberalised in Ireland, early first trimester termination with medical management will occur in the community.  Therefore the access to practitioners is possibly more streamlined in many areas around the country.  If there are clusters of conscientious objectors that limit the geographical access for women and girls to services, the Medical Council is very clear at the moment - it will revise again in response to legislation - that the duty of care continues.  Trying to arrange a transfer and access is part of that duty of care.  A conscientious objector must have a very sincere belief in the ethical dilemma and be conflicted with it.  It is not just a convenient opt-out by the professional.  The testing of conscientious objection may become part of the assessment of competence and become a training issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that we have abortion; it is in the UK.  It is not the perception of all women.  Some women may get a late diagnosis of foetal anomaly at 22 or 23 weeks.  The timeline to make a decision to seek support, to mobilise resources and to self-refer to the UK does not allow them to complete that in two or three weeks.  We are familiar with women who have continued pregnancy even though that was not their desired option.  We need to be careful that we do not allow that to become a commonly used phrase.

Among the survivors, there is a high rate of disability.  That is why viability is important.  For example, if a mother develops severe high blood pressure at 24 weeks, we will intervene.  As the baby is viable, we will make every effort to save the baby.  If a woman develops the same degree of hypertension at 20 weeks, there is no point in trying to save the baby because it has zero chance of survival at 20 weeks.

We have not discussed what those changes will be yet and we are about to deliberate on those options now, but there appears to be broad consensus that the <i>status quo<\/i>cannot be maintained.  That is progress at the end of a number of weeks of very hard work on behalf of each member of this committee.<\/p><p>We discussed at length with our legal advisers the options available to us.  The first option was repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  The difficulties posed by that potentially are that it may be considered in conflict with the Citizens' Assembly but we are open to reporting in our own right as a committee and that is an option we will consider very carefully.<\/p><p>I propose to discuss option No. 2, which is repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution in that the legislation would be drafted and then it would be given a constitutional status.  The difficulties were outlined very clearly to us on that particular option by our legal advisers and the challenges that would present.  The advice to us was that it would be impractical to say the least to have option No. 2 in place because minor amendments or even procedural amendments would require a constitutional referendum, which appears to almost take that option off the floor but we will make a call on that as a group.<\/p><p>Option No. 3 is repeal based on legislation published in tandem with a referendum.  It does appear that this is certainly one option that is quite viable as it does provide a reasonable approach in that I think it is reasonable to say a lot of people, perhaps the majority, will want to know what will be in place after a potential repeal.  If legislation is to be published, it does make sense that citizens would know what the legislation would be and what the intention of the Government would be in terms of drafting it.  That makes sense.<\/p><p>Option No. 4 is repeal and replacement on specific grounds.  That would be a situation whereby we would repeal the eight amendment and we would replace it with another constitutional article which would then detail the specific grounds on which an abortion could be obtained.  I believe the intention under that option is that the grounds would be quite restricted.  Again, that posed challenges in some ways.  There would be an interpretation then by the courts in terms of how that would operate and it would require legislation as well.  That option is, again, not without its challenges.<\/p><p>Option No. 5 is quite similar to option No. 4.  It is repeal and replace on broader grounds, providing a greater degree of flexibility to legislators and to the medical profession.  That is an option we would have to consider in more detail.<\/p><p>Option No. 6 is repeal and replace with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate.  That would repeal the current Article 40.3.3&deg; and replace it with another constitutional article dictating that the Oireachtas would have the sole power to legislate.  This, technically, is what the Citizens' Assembly called for, but again we have the option to discuss that further as a possible outcome.<\/p><p>What is very clear is that there are a number of outcomes and options available to us as a committee.  They will be available to the D&aacute;il to adjudicate on and ultimately to the people.  That is the point to be made.  We are doing a lot of work here in terms of trying to compile a report and have the greatest degree of consensus that we can, although I believe there is an acceptance that we will probably not have full consensus among every committee member, and that is reflective of Parliament and the country.  This is not a decision that will be agreed upon by everybody.  In the context of the legal options available to us, it is incumbent upon us as legislators to discuss in detail how each of those options could be catered for, and that will require us then to look at the possible ways we could legislate for each and every eventual outcome.<\/p><p>In terms of the proposal that was put to the committee today not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full, what that allows us to do is to explore all six options and to decide how best to proceed, but I think there is an acceptance on the part of the majority of members that the <i>status quo <\/i>cannot be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#KK00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that we have made some progress in terms of the vote we have taken tonight, and at least it means that we can now proceed to look at what possibly might be in legislation and the further recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.

I think we have seen evidence of why it would have been desirable to go into public session sooner because many members of the committee did not engage in the discussion we had previously.

There are many things that I would have liked to have said in public session that we did agree in private session but I do want to put on the record that I did submit a motion that the committee recommend the holding of a referendum to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, as did other members of the committee who may wish to state that on the public record.  We recognise that there were other members of the committee who in good faith did not want to have to vote on the issue this evening or this week.  In good faith we accepted that because we do want to reach as much consensus as we can in the committee.  That does not change my position, which is expressed in my motion, but it does mean that we are giving the time we have been asked to give.  That now has to go on the public record because, effectively, there is so much going out in public anyway that we are talking about in private that I do think it is important that we are all able to put our positions.  Clearly, I am not going to push that motion today and we have agreed a procedure.  However, I wish to address the issue of the various options that are before us.<\/p><p>There are three that deserve consideration, one being repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, which is the first option, and the second being No. 3, which is repeal with accompanying legislation, although I do have a bit of a problem with the title of that which is &quot;repeal based on legislation published in tandem with the referendum&quot;, because the legal advice in private indicates that there would be no legal obligation on the Oireachtas to enact that legislation.  However, I think it is helpful to the public politically if people have some idea what legislation the Government is proposing side by side with putting the question to the people by way of referendum.  The third option which I consider to be worth considering is the sixth option, namely, repeal and replace with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate, but I do have a difficulty with that one because there would be an issue with the public because we would be seen to be taking away the power of the Judiciary and taking the power exclusively into the hands of the Oireachtas.  It is a simpler way to accept what is the constitutional convention anyway that the Oireachtas has the power to legislate once it is within the various articles of the Constitution.  While that is technically the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly, I do think there might be an issue with it.  That is something we teased out in private and I am happy to put that much on the record.<\/p><p>We have six options and I think we have made a decision.  I was one of the people who campaigned in 1983 against putting Article 40.3.3&deg; into the Constitution, or at least the original amendment which has subsequently been changed slightly.<\/p><p>I wish to record my satisfaction that, as a committee, we have at least voted to recommend that it should no longer stand as is.  As soon as possible, we should move to make a recommendation on what would be put to the people and, side by side with that, consider the Citizens' Assembly's various recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#KK00600","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The Deputy was bang on five minutes.

I understand why it can be necessary to have meetings in private session to allow people to, for example, avail of legal advice.  Not everyone has the same legal background or knowledge or people may need issues clarified.  Being able to do that in private session is every member's right.  However, I do not feel in any way bound to communicate my views on procedures or otherwise in private session when those procedures are material to what is going on at this committee.<\/p><p>I have put it on the record in public, and will happily say it again now, that what has gone on here has been a farcical and cynical process for many reasons: a thorough preponderance of witnesses-invitees in favour of abortion; no time to question people properly; and no distinction in practice between supposed experts and advocates for abortion.  To put the tin hat on it, we have moved to vote on proposing that the rights of the unborn be taken away to some extent or completely.  That is the implication of what was voted for today.  Not only did we do that without a debate among ourselves on its merits, but we did so without even listening to all of the invitees who were supposed to appear before us.  That illustrates just how cynical what is happening is and it makes a nonsense of the Chairman's protestations in private and public that she would be open to considering inviting more witnesses.  Presumably, there are people who may yet appear before the committee who propose that the retention of the <i>status quo<\/i>is the only thing that would not substract from some people's human rights.  All of that has been set at nought by the pre-emptive decision of this committee without a debate of the merits among ourselves - our only debates have been on procedures - and without hearing from other witnesses.  It would be laughable if what was at stake was not the denial of the human rights of a whole section of our community.<\/p><p>I am disappointed by the two mainstream centrist parties in particular.  In the case of Fianna F&aacute;il, two members voted to take away in some shape or form the eighth amendment, which protects the human rights of the unborn as well as the mother, and two abstained.  That is a million miles away from what the ordinary members of that party decided at their own Ard-Fheis last Saturday.  In the case of Fine Gael, only one of its five committee members voted against substracting from the human rights of the unborn.  That is a million miles away from where so many of the ordinary membership of that party is.  It reminds me of the famous line from William Butler Yeats:<\/p><blockquote>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br \/><br \/>Are full of passionate intensity.<\/blockquote> <p>What is at stake is unprecedented, namely, the denial of human dignity, or respect for same, for a whole section of our community.  We had a great tradition in this country.  Please God, and regardless of whether people are persons of faith, I hope that the Irish people will vote to protect and include everyone in our society.  What has been decided by the committee's majority tonight is a repudiation of that.  It is shameful in terms of human rights and human dignity.  This is a bad moment for respect for human dignity in these Houses.  It may be happening downstairs in a quiet chamber with not many people listening in, but human rights are being denied in these Houses.  Consider what those who fought for independence for and that the 1983 amendment was a beacon to the world.  To have a denial of all of that without even a debate on the merits among members or hearing from all of the witnesses is cynical and tragic.<\/p><p>I do not know what we can do now.  What the committee has done is create a situation in which every proposal is bad because it takes away respect for some people's human dignity and implies that some people will no longer have the protection of the law - vulnerable young babies, sick young babies, disabled young babies or perhaps just every young baby who is not wanted or for whom an abortion is sought.  That is a tragic situation and a bad pass for the committee to have arrived at tonight.  I deeply regret it.  Many people in this country will regret what the committee has decided.  Thankfully, the committee will not have the final say.  Nor will the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The great achievement of the eighth amendment was to take this issue away from judicial and parliamentary elites and give it to the people of Ireland.  I hope that the Irish people will decide to be inclusive rather than exclusive of human dignity if and when this comes to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#LL00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in public on this matter.  The purpose of the motion that I tabled was to arrive at a situation where we could consider the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations.  Tabling it was important because we were asked to consider those recommendations as part of our terms of reference.  If we had just opted for a repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, we would have had parked the substantive recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, namely, that Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>should not be retained in full, it should be replaced or amended or it should be replaced with a constitutional provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of the pregnant woman.  These were the three substantive issues on which the Citizens' Assembly voted.  Had we supported a repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, we effectively would not have been debating those recommendations anymore and it would have been difficult to move on to its following recommendations in view of the fact that we had rejected them without consideration.<\/p><p>This is a compromise.  We can still debate the substantive issues and all of the legal advice and options that have been placed before us.  Deputy Chambers and others have gone through them.  Some of them sit uncomfortably with me not only in the context of what they propose, but predominantly on legal grounds.  Entrenching legislation in the Constitution, which was recommended in option No. 2 on a repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution, would be a dangerous road to take.  While it might give certainty, it gives no flexibility.  We could be tying the hands of legislators and others for many years to come if we opted for the entrenchment proposal.  Even if people just wanted to change a comma, we would have to hold another constitutional referendum.  That option should be parked fairly soon in our deliberations.<\/p><p>On the broader issue of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, it allows for the Oireachtas to legislate in its own right and within the confines of judicial oversight.  This might affect the rights of the unborn that are already recognised without being explicit in the Constitution, but we would not know what the effect might be until after the legislation was enacted and subjected to constitutional challenge on grounds of expressed or inherent rights in the Constitution for the unborn, bodily integrity, privacy or the other areas stated in the legal opinion.<\/p><p>This is probably the option that many people believe would give the Oireachtas the most flexibility to legislate but, once the repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>is passed by the people, what do those who are currently proposing it propose in terms of legislation?  This is an important question and people need to be up front about it.  Have they in mind a restrictive proposal in terms of fatal foetal abnormalities, incest, rape or something else?  Will it relate to the health of the woman?  Where do they sit in this regard?<\/p><p>That is an issue the committee will have to tease out if there is a recommendation for a repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  It would be disingenuous to propose a repeal<i>simpliciter<\/i>without setting out in a broad legislative format what one will recommend in the context of a referendum.  The publication of legislation in tandem has been proposed before and tried before.  There is no legal framework that underpins it other than that it would be a political intention to pass legislation if the public changed the Constitution or repealed Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  That is probably just a political possibility whereby there would be broad consensus as to what would be put before the people by political parties or broad opinion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There could be no legislative guarantee in view of the fact that very soon after the referendum, there could be an election, a change of opinion or proposed amending legislation.  As such, the draft legislation might be substantially changed.  However, it might give comfort to some individuals to have an opinion as to what they are voting on in the context of repeal.  People should be upfront and honest, individually and politically as parties, if they have an opinion or a policy as to what should be in that legislation.<br\/><br\/>We have been discussing this issue for quite some time over the past couple of weeks.  We should not be complaining about that, however, because we are charged with a fundamental issue and should take our deliberations very seriously, as all members are doing.  We have a deadline by which we must report.  Whether we make a decision today, tomorrow or next week, we ultimately must report by mid-December.  There is no prevarication on my part.  The motion I tabled was never intended to delay decisions.  All decisions must be made within three months of our first public meeting, which took place in mid-September.  Regardless of whether motions are put down to delay a decision in the context of the modular process, my motion was not put down to delay the final decision, which will be made when the committee has completed its full deliberations.  Some people seem to suggest the motions were put down for prevaricative or even provocative reasons, which was certainly not my intention.  I have never tried to make political capital out of this particular issue since I was appointed spokesperson by Fianna F&aacute;il six years ago.  I wish that to be clear to everybody in the room.  People can look at the views I have expressed publicly in the D&aacute;il and in committees in previous times.  They will see that I have never tried to put other political parties under pressure in this context.  It is too serious and emotive and it deserves that respect from others as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#LL00400","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I am one of a handful of people in the room who got to vote on this in 1983.  I voted not to amend the Constitution because it is not the place to legislate.  That is what is being done.  One is legislating in the Constitution if one includes something in the Constitution.  That has coloured my opinion in respect of the view I have taken.  Like Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I tabled a motion for a straightforward repeal and that is how we should proceed.  We were told by our legal adviser that there is no such thing as legal certainty, which we all accept.  However, the more legal certainty there is, the less flexibility there is.  We have been cursed by the fact that there has been no legal flexibility by virtue of the fact that we tied ourselves into an article in the Constitution that requires change even for the most extreme situations.  That eliminates for me a number of the options that are put in front of us, which are based on entrenching legislation in the Constitution.  There is nothing else entrenched in the Constitution.  It would be a new departure and it would be the wrong way to go.<\/p> <p>  While I accept some of the points which have been made, my concern about repeal based on legislation published in tandem is that if it is overly restrictive, the courts may interpret it in an overly restrictive way.  I have no problem specifying that this is an issue that should be embedded in health care.  I will have no problem specifying that when we come to the last phase of the process when we deal with the individual items we recommend be included in legislation.  Option No. 5 on \"broad grounds\" does exactly the same thing, in that it takes away flexibility.<\/p> <p>  Option No. 6 is the provision of exclusive powers to the Oireachtas, which is what the Citizens' Assembly recommended.  I note the previous referendum result where it was sought to give more powers to Oireachtas committees.  Changing the balance between the courts and the Oireachtas is not necessarily favoured by citizens.  They like to have that balance and this option is, therefore, not a good way to go.  I am firmly of the opinion that to repeal or not is the option that should be put to the citizens.  That comes down to who one trusts.  We are asking citizens to make this decision.  I certainly am willing to trust women and doctors.  I certainly am willing to accept the decision the citizens will make.  However, we have to be clear and coherent with the question we put to them.  The more straightforward question is the one which is largely expected.  It is open to people to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" to that.  Those are the reasons I came to the conclusions I did on the options.<\/p> <p>  We decided on a modular approach in July and some of us expected there would be decisions after each one.  I am perfectly willing to accept the honestly-held position of many members that they want more time.  For that reason, I will certainly not be pressing my particular proposal until people feel comfortable with us discussing that.  If that takes another few weeks, so be it.  However, there are people in the room who do not want this put and who want to retain Article 40.3.3o in the Constitution.  I believe they are frustrating the process and that should be called out.  It is not about being in here and being disingenuous.  It is fundamentally about not wanting a repeal or a discussion on it; it is about retention.  Let us just say what it is.  We have heard some discussion of human rights.  Health is a human right and women have a right to have their human rights respected in the context of health.  That is part of the reason I have taken the position I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#MM00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>It is very unfair to say we are making decisions before all of the evidence has been heard and without fully debating the issues.  Most members have engaged very frankly, wholeheartedly and sincerely.  For weeks, we have been listening to the very real difficulties with the current arrangement.<\/p><p>Dr. Peter Boylan said today that grave harm was done to women, including death.  We know the present arrangement is hugely problematic for women in respect of their lives and health.  The top echelons of the medical profession have told us week after week that they need flexibility and capacity to respond in terms of best practice in medicine in respect of maternity and foetal care.  They claim the present constitutional arrangement does not give them such flexibility and capacity.  The decision we made earlier was not to retain the present constitutional arrangement; that is all that was decided.  Many members are in different places on that issue, which is absolutely fine, but to say we have not debated enough to get to that position is very disingenuous.<\/p><p> We have had much discussion on the intention of the Citizens' Assembly.  We debated it yesterday with our legal adviser and with Ms Justice Laffoy.  Anybody who reads the transcripts of the proceedings of the Citizens' Assembly and accounts for the voting process will realise it was very clear that the citizens wanted to take this issue out of the Constitution.  There was an overwhelming vote for repeal and a little complication about something being replaced, but we teased that out and it was very clear that the citizens were afraid that the courts might try to tie the hands of the Oireachtas so it would be limited in its capacity to legislate for abortion provision.  We had a discussion on these issues.<\/p><p> Arising today and every week was the idea that putting anything in the Constitution on such an intimate, private, individual health matter is very problematic in any of its formats.  In that sense, option No. 2, which involves putting specific legislation into our Constitution, is the worst.  In no other case is such an arrangement at play.  If there were technical changes, or otherwise, the provision could not be changed.  The legal adviser said it is completely impractical and without precedent.  On that basis, option No. 2 is really a non-runner.<\/p><p> We were told option No. 4 would be incredibly legally difficult.  I agree.  It would not be so totally impractical as option No. 2 but near enough.  It would put down woolly grounds in the Constitution.  Again, it is open to wide interpretation.  Option No. 5, which would put in broader grounds, was a little bit more problematic. <\/p><p> We did make a comparison with the divorce referendum and tease it out.  Regarding divorce, some criteria were put into the Constitution in this regard.  We said in private session yesterday that we have to take into account that the Oireachtas and Attorney General are now considering taking all that out of the Constitution because it proved cumbersome.  The idea of a constitutional referendum to change this is not really practical.  These matters of personal decision-making are really best left out of the Constitution.  That issue was dealt with in terms of options Nos. 2, 4 and 5.<\/p><p> I agree with the points made that, although option No. 6 was the one chosen by the Citizens' Assembly, it is putting something in the Constitution and is writing out a role for the Judiciary that I do not believe would be welcome .  It is not something that exists in other scenarios.  Generally speaking, the interaction between the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the legislation is fairly flexible.  It has worked pretty well.  The courts have been pretty good at interpreting matters when given space in this regard.  Including in the Constitution something that, in effect, is trying to diminish the role of the Judiciary is not a good thing.  It means one is left with options Nos. 1 and 3 as runners.  My belief is that option No. 1, a simple repeal, is the best.  Option No. 3 is repeal while publishing some sort of legislation in order that people might have an idea as to what legislation might look like.  Our legal adviser told us that is really a political matter rather than a legal matter.  It would not necessarily have any legal status but might be a little reassuring.<\/p><p> A constant theme in all this is that no matter what option we pick, criminalising women who have abortions is completely unacceptable to people.  It arose again today.  I believe the professor put it very well when he turned it the other way and said that, while many people have different opinions on abortion, they would give a very different answer if asked whether they wanted women to go to prison for abortion.  Decriminalisation is an issue we have to address.  It will deal with many of the issues. <\/p><p> We have made good progress.  There was really genuine engagement by most members of the committee.  I have seen games, however.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct that there are games being played here.  We have heard the opening salvos of the referendum campaign in some of the speeches tonight.  It is not something to look forward to.  There are also elements of the media playing games with this issue.  Perhaps, through creating a big, cut-and-thrust divisive debate bringing us back to 1983, it is an attempt to halt flagging newspapers sales.  People are not in 1983.  The committee has demonstrated an ability to listen to impartial evidence-based advice.  We can be adamant enough in making decisions on that basis without other people, inside or outside, trying to goad us on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#MM00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Those who fought for Irish freedom will celebrate tonight that Oireachtas Members can make a decision and ultimately allow the people to vote in a free democratic decision-making process to amend or not the Constitution of our country.

I do not believe so.  The eighth amendment is a testament to a different era.  It is also about the fact that people can afford to go to England.  Dr. Boylan put across very clearly today that people can afford to go abroad.  A generation of people are looking to us, as politicians, to be leaders.  The human rights bodies have made a decision and rulings on us in respect of the eighth amendment being too inflexible.  Dr. Boylan made it quite clear that Savita Halappanavar, whose anniversary is approaching, would have been alive today but for the eighth amendment to our Constitution.  We may quote the Mellet case, where the State had to make a payment because of the eighth amendment but I fundamentally believe there is no such thing as legal certainty, as Deputy Murphy said and as we heard from the evidence.

I am watching that journey and I recognise it because it was a journey I took not too long ago in coming to a certain position.  It happens especially when one is faced with the mountain of evidence and clear literature such as in the presentations we have seen.

It has become very clear what is off the table and what is not workable or practical.  Much of the evidence in the beginning was on certainty.  The further we went along, it became evident that certainty is not the most important thing to look at.  We are looking at what is workable and flexible.  Based on what has been said about option two and entrenched legislation and option four which is repeal and replace on certain grounds - I could be referring to the wrong option numbers - it is very clear they do not work.  Whatever we do after today, we should definitely work towards narrowing the legal advice in order that everything is not still floating around in the ether as something that needs to be discussed.  We have already figured out that retain in full is off the table and we do not need to discuss it.  I propose that, going forward, we narrow down the choices in terms of what is practical and flexible in order we are not rehashing this over and over again.  I will not go back into everything that has been mentioned because Deputy Daly summarised the options very well.  I want clarification on whether people who are watching proceedings will have access to the options.

One member referred to 1916 and asked if it is what our forefathers gave their lives for.  The people who fought in 1916, certainly in the case of James Connolly, were advocates of women's rights and I assume would have been open to women having bodily autonomy.  The sands have shifted in society.  People who had a hegemony in the past are now struggling to find anyone in authority who will back up their desire to retain the eighth amendment.  That is the real problem.  We have had a vote on not maintaining the eighth amendment in full and the public should be apprised of the words in full.  That was the wording that was given to the Citizens' Assembly and is quite pointed.  It was not just about retaining the eighth amendment.  One can see how the Citizens' Assembly would have arrived at the decision it arrived at.  It is fine to vote for that but we cannot leave it at that.  We now have to go on to look at the options.  It would be a bit ridiculous to make that decision and then tell the public we will come back and review what we do with the eighth amendment and the Constitution in five weeks.  People are saying we have made a decision but to the public it would be seen as though it were a snail's pace decision.  Why are we here?  We are here because there is a problem with the eighth amendment.  We all knew this was a forward-only process.  It was not a backward process.  Let us not try to pretend this is earth shattering.<\/p> <p>  I want to deal with some of the options that have been put forward and then some of the motions.  Six options have been suggested by the legal adviser.  Three or four of them are similar in that they still envisage some kind of amendment or replacement of the eighth amendment that would either entrench legislation in the Constitution or list grounds that would be in the Constitution.  There is no legal certainty with those because any of them could be challenged by a woman whose rights are being violated and she could take a case.  The United Nations would continue to challenge it.  It would also be politically unacceptable to most people for us to deal with this issue in the Constitution in a restrictive way when most people see there is a reality we are meant to be dealing with.<\/p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly took option six and it was said either in this session or during the private session that we would be going against the Citizens' Assembly if we went for a simple repeal.  That is not the case because the intent of the Citizens' Assembly was clearly to repeal the eighth amendment to allow abortion legislation to be introduced on a very widespread basis judging by the vote it took the following day.  It received legal advice that convinced 53% of the assembly to go in one direction which was that some kind of clause was needed to make sure there would not be a challenge to that legislation.  It went with that advice.  When Ms Justice Laffoy attended the committee, it could have been put to her there was an overemphasis on the dangers of a simple repeal and not enough consideration in the Citizens' Assembly because it is dangerous to put any wording into the Constitution.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the option suggested in the wording, although the Citizens' Assembly did not write it, politically would be quite dangerous.  It would mean that any legislation could be immune to challenge by an individual in the courts.  If that were to be put to a referendum, I do not believe that it would be acceptable to people.  Therefore, a simple repeal would be best.<\/p><p> My motion is still on the table because we need the eighth amendment to be repealed.  I do not think this discussion will be concluded tonight.  I do not know how many people have indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#OO01600","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Seven more members have indicated, so I think it probably will if we stick to the five minutes each.

I want to make another point.  We heard a lot about Savita Halappanavar today.  It would have been good if this committee made the decision that the eighth amendment would be repealed before the anniversary of her death.  The Oireachtas has had five years to deal with this.  Although some people say they are not ready, we agreed on 11 July to have a modular structure.  It is a pity that that is not being adhered to, but this is not about procedure.  The first question is why people are not ready.  This has been known about for  years and the Citizens' Assembly reported in April, so people had ample time to get legal advice and to consider the issues.  My fear, however, is that those who are saying they are not ready but in private session are saying that they are in favour of repeal will use the repeal vote to bargain against other things being agreed.  It is not my fault they are gone, but everyone noticed the vote that was taken at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis three days ago, which might have had a bearing on people over the last day.  However, I do not think those people are representative, given opinion polls have shown that 10% of people oppose changing the eighth amendment.  Therefore, most people realise that there has to be change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#PP00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The Deputy is now over time.

I am particularly proud that it was Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who made the proposal this evening.  It is fitting because I think the republican position would be to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg;.  Unfortunately, I am old enough to remember the original amendment.  I was 17, it was my first vote and I voted against the proposal.  I campaigned against it too and I remember how divisive it was at the time.  I was accosted on a train because I was wearing a \"Vote No\" badge.  The local postmaster, God bless him, a man in his 80s, chased me with a stick because I left leaflets campaigning for a \"No\" vote.  I hope the votes next year will not be as divisive.  Despite having a range of different opinions in the room, I am encouraged that most of us have decided genuinely to try to work towards consensus, to build towards the best decision we can make and to work constructively.  That applies to almost all the members here today.<\/p> <p>  I also recognise that people are on a journey.  Having listened to the evidence over the past number of weeks, there are two possibilities.  One - the outlandish possibility - is that there is a giant medical conspiracy and that all these people got together somehow in a darkened room and decided to unleash abortion on us.  The other is that these medical professionals, whose jobs are to care for women and babies, are telling us the truth, which is that there is a major problem with this amendment.  Senator Mullen referred to a denial of human rights to a whole section of our society.  We had that denial for 34 years.  This amendment was always wrong.  Thankfully, we now live in a changed time.  All of us have to have the courage to continue to work constructively together and to listen to the evidence, which is so clear.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also put forward a motion for straight repeal.  That is our position.  Again, as we understand and everyone is in the same place we are, we are happy to work constructively with the rest of our colleagues to try to reach the best decision possible.  Let us be proud of taking one small step today.  This committee is not a farce.  Most of us are working constructively.  I compliment the Chair on the work she is doing.  Those making a farce of it are those dancing outside the gates of Leinster House when they should have been in here listening to evidence.  Let us try to work together constructively.  Let us accept that we will not agree on everything.  Our position is clear.  We believe in a straight repeal.  We have heard enough already in terms of the various options, so I will not repeat those comments.  Today is a good day.

As the committee is aware, I was one of the people who preferred to have a vote on any procedural changes at the end, when we had discussed the entire issue, as the Citizens' Assembly did.  However, in order to facilitate the ongoing cohesive nature of the discussion so far, I decided on balance that it was better to do so.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept Senator Mullen's criticism at all.  In fact, he had an opportunity himself to raise all of the issues that he complained other people did not raise but he did not.  For instance, he could have invoked the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is not at all silent of the subject and gives myriad areas for him to pursue.  Perhaps he will do that, and I hope he will, to ensure that the committee is not skewed, as he suggested.  He could have invoked the charter for fundamental rights, which refers in a particular way to the issues under discussion here, and he did not.  I would have thought that he would have done it as a matter of course in order to strengthen the case.  He then would not have to accuse everyone else of being pro-abortion or whatever it was that he was suggesting.  Incidentally, I am not in favour of abortion and have never been in favour of it but I realise that certain things have to be done from time to time to address the issues that have become contentious in our society.  I have spoken about them many times in the past.  I know that some people got very excited when I referred to some of those subjects but I assure the committee that I will continue to speak on those subjects, as is my right.<\/p> <p>  We have not decided to change the Constitution.  We have decided to refer a question to the people.  It is a decision that they alone must make.  The decision we made tonight was to refer to the people a proposal not to retain it in full.  The people can retain it in part or a replica thereof, whatever the case may be.  That is their decision, not ours.  The people will make the decision, presumably, on the basis of having heard all the evidence that is being made available.

We had a very frank discussion in private session on how we should proceed and everyone who expressed a view was respected and listened to, regardless of their position.  It is very unfortunate that some people chose not to express any opinion in private, as is their right.<\/p><p>The reason I put the proposal forward was because I felt that in order to deal with the options available to us - the very varying options which range from straight-up repeal to putting in a replacement on specific or broad grounds or legislation to be entrenched in the Constitution - it needed further, detailed discussion by this committee in public.  I believe the only way we could have that public discussion on the options was to make a decision not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full.  I am very glad that the committee has done that.  I recognise that does not tie the hands of anyone on the committee to any particular option which is being discussed.  If we can have that discussion in the same comradely and open manner in which we have had all our discussions to date, in which we have been very respectful of each others views, then this committee will be going in the right direction.<\/p><p>Whatever the outcome at the end of this process, people can say that this committee was not a farce and we listened to all the opinions.  Even today, we had an opinion from Professor Peter Boylan when he discussed the issue of rape and how we could address that.  I made a note of what he said which was that there was a straightforward way of legislating for cases involving rape which was the legal prescription of the abortion pill.  Other witnesses who have told the committee that it would be very difficult to legislate on the grounds of rape.  It is important that we continue to hear the testimony from our witnesses which will frame any decision that we will make on the options.  In order to get there, we had to have that vote earlier this evening.  Senator Mullen knows my position on this.  He talks about democracy but what he tried to do tonight was deny democracy to the Irish people to make a decision on this.  If someone wants to vote in a referendum to retain the <i>status quo<\/i>, that is their right.  We are giving them that opportunity by making a decision not to retain it in full and to look at the options.  <\/p><p>I look forward to the committee continuing its work in the same manner as it has done to date.  It is important that we try to reach a decision as quickly as possible now that we have decided that we are not going to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in the Constitution.  We have the different options before us, my view being that option 1, of straight-up repeal, is the best.  Options 2, 4 and 5 include some form of replacement to be inserted into the Constitution; I do not believe that is where we should deal with women's health issues so for that reason I do not support them.<\/p><p>Option 6, to insert a provision that the legislature would have to legislate for it, taking it outside the scope of the Judiciary which I feel would be a mistake.  We need to retain that separation of power between the Legislature and the Judiciary.  Option 6 would not be a good option.<\/p><p>Option 3 is to have published legislation in tandem.  The difficulty with that is there is no guarantee that the published legislation would be passed by the Oireachtas and I would not like to put any published legislation as part of the referendum when there is no guarantee that it would pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The best option is straight-up repeal, it is the one that I favour.  I respect that others have not come to that conclusion and they may never come to that conclusion; they may favour another option and that is their right but it is was important to make that decision this evening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#QQ01300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien.

I think it is a great moment for Ireland, for all the people of Ireland.  One of the members spoke of the denial of dignity for a whole section of the community, I believe they were referring to unborn children.  Women in Ireland have been denied dignity for years now.  I spoke earlier about abstract women, but these are our neighbours, the person serving us in a shop, they are colleagues, nieces, aunts and daughters.  From the outset, in the Citizens' Assembly, there were sections which spoke of it being a predetermined process.  When the result of the assembly came out, they said its recommendations were said to be far broader than anyone could accept, the process was wrong, the way its members were chosen was wrong.  There were arguments put forward, with people asking why there were no people from certain counties when, if one read the process, it was very clear why the process of picking the 99 citizens did not operate on the basis of county boundaries.  Then their arguments moved on to accusations that the committee is biased when things are not going right, and then the witnesses are biased.  Here we are now, we have come to this moment and I commend Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for putting the proposal forward.  Now that we are over that, which is a good thing, we can move on to where we need to be.<\/p> <p>  Where do we need to be?  The lack of certainty is the issue.  One thing the committee has learned is that there is no such thing as certainty in any of the options put before us; none of them are iron-clad.  Then we must ask which of the uncertainties that may emerge is most readily rectified so that we could ask how we might fix it.<\/p><p>There are six options and I do not want to repeat everything that has been said already but three, that is options two, four and five, are off the table.  This is because they have legislation entrenched in the Constitution, meaning if there ever was a change there would have to be another referendum.  This is a fluid process and I felt one way last week but another way today but I rule those three options out.  Option three involves legislation and I do not know if we will publish the legal advice but this is a political solution.  We might never put legislation before the people which details what we will do if the amendment is repealed.  Any such legislation could be amended so we have to ask if we would be acting honestly with the people and we would have to be very careful about it.  People could ask if we pulled the wool over the eyes of the people of Ireland in such a context so there remain two options for me, numbers one and six.  I dealt with number one last week but I have thought about it a lot since and I believe option six is still an option.  I have to consider where it came from and we have to tease it out a bit more.  There is a high degree of flexibility with this option and it will come down to whether the people of Ireland trust the Oireachtas to do their will during the legislative process.  In the next couple of months, the importance of who the people put in these Houses will be highlighted.  It is not just about the lad who fixed the road - this is about fundamental human rights, women's rights in Ireland.  It is so important that a person who puts his or her X in the box for their No. 1 choice knows who they are getting if that person is elected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#QQ01500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I oppose the vote on removing Article 40.3.3&deg;.  I have always had my suspicions about bias in this committee.  The overwhelming vote in favour of removing Article 40.3.3&deg; means the genie is out of the bottle.  It is an insult to some of the eminent people who are due to come in and make a presentation to us that we have already decided to do this.  We have dismissed some of the reports of the Citizens' Assembly.  There was a huge geographical area of 11 counties, of which mine was one, which were not represented.  If that is fair you can call me Davy.<\/p> <p>  The recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis brought a new low in cynicism.  The ink is not dry on the motion to retain the eighth amendment but two of that party's Deputies have voted to remove it tonight, or abstained.  The public, however, can see what is going on in the committee and that it is not a question of Senator Mullen and me whingeing.  I wish to defend Senator Mullen's reputation.  He is not in any way trying to subvert democracy.  Many members called for us to go into public session while we were in private session.  We kept our counsel until the public session but why bother?  We knew the outcome.  Deputy O'Connell mentioned the bias and the numbers show this, with 20 out of 26 witnesses to the committee being on one side of the argument.  Up to 16 have come in so far and given their views.  I respect their professional advice but they were all in favour of legalising abortion and removing the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>  The question of human rights was raised.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il, where I spoke on the pensions issue.  The Fine Gael Government talks about an Ireland of equal opportunities but mothers who were forced to give up work when they got married and raised their families are being punished.  The Minister for Finance says it is bonkers but he has just delivered the budget, which was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#RR00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to stick to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#RR00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I ask the Chair to allow me to speak without interruption.

As far as I am concerned, the sooner it comes the better and I look forward to it.<\/p> <p>  The genie is out of the bottle as regards this committee because it is clearly biased.  It shuts out women who have been hurt by abortion and it has shut out advocates whom we wanted to come before the committee.  People have been bullied and harassed to prevent them from speaking on the subject at events in hotels.  I came in here with a three-minute animated video of what an abortion entailed but the committee did not want it.  It is all one-way traffic and our future participation will be limited because there is no point in being part of the committee.  The committee was to be fair and have representatives from all sides and this was its badge of honour but, as I said, the genie is out of the bottle now.<\/p> <p>  I do not have much interest in the six options that have been put forward but I want to defend Senator Mullen.  He did not want to stop democracy.  We can decide if we do not want to meet in private session.  I appealed for the meeting to be public but the media were locked out.  The media contribute to transparency and openness so why should we do business behind closed doors?<\/p> <p>  The denial of human dignity to unborn children is anathema to what I stand for.  I am proud of what I stand for and I have plenty of support for it.  We have deadlines and we have said we must finish by Christmas but what is the indecent haste?  We should listen to all the experts.  The Chair said other people could come in but why would they?  We have made the decision to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg; so it is a charade.  There was hostility towards us - it has been a better today - just because we were asking questions to which we needed answers.  When it did not suit certain people in this committee, we were treated like pariahs.  That is no way to run a committee in this House.  I sit on several committees and this does not happen on any of them.  I would love to know why this has to be so different.

She has been very fair and it is not easy.<\/p><p>This is a very complex and divisive issue, we have a large body of work to do by mid-December and there are differing views among the members of this committee.  I will take this opportunity to say there is great value in holding private session meetings.  Some may dispute this, but I think there has been good value in them because there has been consensus and respect for those who spoke on motions to be put forward, for example, to repeal the eighth amendment.  I am not in favour of that at this point because we have a process in which we need to engage and more witnesses to meet.  The vote we took allows us to debate the substantive issues surrounding the eighth amendment, which is crucial.  That is the work we need to do over the next few weeks and the witnesses who will come before us will help us.  It was very interesting to hear members who had views already formed coming into this committee saying they had changed their minds on different issues.  That is very healthy and just shows the importance of this process.  Members feel they might understand a particular area and then they hear from witnesses and, through questioning them, open themselves up and learn more about that area.  That is what is important about this process.  We all have something to learn, and that is the importance of being here and engaging.<\/p><p> We have received legal advice in private session on the six options we have, and members have outlined a number of issues in this regard.  Regarding the sixth option, when Ms Justice Laffoy was before the committee, she said her view was that the eighth amendment should be repealed and replaced with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate the law in this area.  In layman's language, this would involve repeal of the eighth amendment and the insertion of text into the Constitution stating that the Oireachtas shall have exclusive power to legislate in this area.  As has been highlighted here - and it is very important to say this - members of the Citizens' Assembly looking at these proceedings will ask why we are not taking their views on board.  The removal of judicial oversight would have many implications, and the only other precedent for it would be in times of war or armed rebellion.  We need to look at our three branches of government: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  The intention is that they are all interdependent and that there is a balance of power.  I do not know whether we need to write to Ms Justice Laffoy asking her whether that is her intention.  I think she was seeking some kind of legal clarity whereby the law could not be challenged but I do not think there can be a situation whereby there will not be a challenge-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#RR01500","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Yes, I think that is impossible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#SS00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>-----so perhaps we need to get further clarification in that regard.<\/p><p>In the case of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 then becomes the law of the land.

I will not rehash everything everyone has already said.  I am one of the two members who abstained earlier.  I thank all the members who came to the table in private session to discuss the options we have.  They tried to be flexible, to engage with everyone and to listen to everyone's viewpoint.  All the various private sessions have been very helpful to me.  In fairness to Senator Ruane, when she put down her first motion and all that followed, Deputy Kelleher then put down his counter-motion but a compromise was reached this evening to allow the process to move along.  That is thanks to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for coming forward.  The matter was teased out at length in order to move it forward.  What I will say to the dissenting voices in the room is that it was such a pity they did not engage because there was an opportunity there for their voices to be heard, as opposed to their sitting on their hands and not engaging.  The whole reason of having a private session was that we could have heard all the voices present.  That is what happened during the private session and for that I thank members.<\/p> <p>  I will be open and honest.  I would have preferred not to have had a vote until the end of module 2 for the simple reason that I wanted as many people to come before me as possible.  I was playing a listening exercise while participating.  Some people have very well-formed opinions, whereas my opinion was not the most well-formed.  At the same time, I have learned an awful lot as the committee's work has come along.  This is why I would have preferred us not to have had a vote this evening.  In fairness to all the 22 members here, we want to see progress.  I want to be part of that progress and feed into it because we need to move forward and know what we are about.  A lot of hard work goes on at this committee.  Many people come with an awful lot of work done in advance, which needs to be acknowledged.  It is unfair to say it is a skewed process and that people have very determined views.  Everyone has a determined view.  Let us be under no illusion.  We all have a well-formed opinion but we must engage in our well-formed opinion and tease it out in order that we have a good result at the end.  Ultimately, the people of Ireland will make a decision as to what option to take, and I look forward to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#SS00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Deputy Rabbitte has said much of what I had intended to say.  I have full faith in Senator Noone as Chairman.  She is doing a very good job in what is probably the most difficult committee, in terms of topic at least, to be established in a long time.  We will have a referendum next year, and that is right and proper.  We now have pretty much three generations of people who have not had a say on this matter.  The last time there was a fundamental decision on it was in 1983, and it is only right that people have a say.  We need to remind ourselves that we are not changing the law here.  We are going through the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and we will make a recommendation to the D&aacute;il, which in turn will ultimately make a decision on the question that will go before the people, and the people will make the final decision.  All we are doing is making a recommendation as to the question that should be put.  I abstained because there is still evidence to be given that will help to inform my decision.  The proposal put by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was timely.  It was not divisive in any way, and this was proven by the fact that 18 out of 20 people were able to take a position on it.  I have not been able to do so yet but I reserve my right effectively to change my vote as time moves on if I so decide.<\/p><p>I will make a few points about my position.  The criminalisation of someone who has an abortion is fundamentally wrong.  I know this is not part of the referendum <i>per se<\/i>but I think it is wrong.  I will answer the question put earlier: no one should be imprisoned for having an abortion.  Decriminalisation is different from legalisation, and that is an important point.  I will make an observation on the evidence surrounding use of the abortion pill.  It is effectively freely available.  The safety of it is questionable only because of how it is sourced.  It is effectively a disruptor, and people will have to consider that the evidence appears to show that one cannot enforce regulation to prevent an abortion at ten weeks' gestation or earlier.  Everyone, no matter what side he or she is on, will have to take that into consideration because a law that is unenforceable needs to be very seriously considered.<\/p><p>I will make just one other observation.  It concerns the second option, which is repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution.  I practised law in the courts for 11 years.  I have sat in on debates and legal argument that has lasted over an hour on the meaning of a comma, semicolon or colon and how it changes the meaning of a sentence.  It is simply not practical to put detailed legislation into the Constitution.  I think the unintended consequences to come out of that would be phenomenal.  For this reason it is simply not practical.  As I said, I reserve my position in respect of the actual question but that is where I am at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#SS00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Last but not least, I call on Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017101800002#SS00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1508330400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

Those interested in getting the most out of the committee should make themselves available and vocalise their opinions for the benefit not just of the cameras and the media but to help other members to learn, to share opinions and come to a collective decision.  The opportunity for people to thrash out any issues they had was in private session this afternoon and most did so.  Those that did do so not chose to air their opinions and I think the word used was \"shenanigans\".  I would definitely use that word to describe what went on.<\/p><p> The committee has a job to do.  It made some progress today and made a bold statement that the status quo cannot continue.  During every moment I sit on the committee I become more proud of my parents for campaigning against the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution.  I am resolved to thank them for the work they did, albeit it was unsuccessful but they knew that at the time.  We need to take our steer not from cartoons but from people such as Dr. Peter Boylan who are eminent in their profession and have given their entire careers and most of their adult lives to caring for women.  When Dr. Peter Boylan, as a professional, says the eighth amendment needs to be repealed, we need to listen and start working with those responsible for delivering care to women and trying to make it a bit easier for them.  It is regrettable that those who say they favour repeal were not in a position to support repeal.  However, it is also important that we get an opportunity to ask all the questions that need to be asked.  We will do as much of that as possible in public session and that is important because people are watching what the committee does.

I certainly do not have a closed mind as regards a number of the issues covered by the amendments.  I express my appreciation for the work that the Deputies have done in recent weeks and their diligent and significant efforts in arriving at a programme of almost 200 amendments.

For the notation of members, the first of those is amendment No. 25 in the names of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers.  The note from the Bills Office is that this amendment seeks to add the Presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court to the list of members of the commission.  Section 4 of the Bill provides that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act should be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 14 provides for the payment to members of remuneration and allowances for expenses.  The Bills Office advices that the amendment must, therefore, be considered to be out of order on the grounds that it causes a charge on revenue in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).<\/p> <p>  Before taking any comment from either of the two proposers, I advise that amendment No. 34 in the name of Deputy Daly has the same ruling.  That amendment seeks to add a person nominated by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, to the list of members of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#B01600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  He communicated that to me by way of a letter and has just stated the ruling again.  In fairness to him, it is an instruction that he has received from the Bills Office, so I do not hold him in any way responsible for ruling amendment No. 25 out of order.<\/p> <p>  The basis for it being ruled out of order is that it incurs a potential charge on revenue, but I find that difficult to accept.  My amendment proposes that the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court be added to the judicial appointments commission.  No charge is involved in that.  There is no claim for remuneration that a judge is entitled to as a result of being a member of the commission.  We know that the expenses of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, on which sit the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court, were in the region of less than &euro;5,000 last year, so I do not see how it can be suggested that, by adding them, I am putting a charge on revenue.<\/p> <p>  What makes it even more surprising is my amendment No. 49, which seeks the appointment of six individuals to the commission.  They would be persons nominated by the Citizens Information Board, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, FLAC and the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  Some of these are included in Deputy Daly's amendment, which is being ruled out of order, so I do not see how amendment No. 49 stands when amendment No. 25 is ruled out of order.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that the Chairman cannot change this, but I want to record my objection.  It is appropriate that this body contain the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  They are members of the JAAB.  The majority of appointments are to the District and Circuit courts.  By excluding the presidents of those courts from membership of the commission, we are doing a disservice to the public and losing out on important expertise.  The Chairman cannot do anything about it this morning, but I will seek to table amendments to that effect on the next Stage when the Bill returns to the D&aacute;il so as to ensure that those two officeholders are members of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#B01700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputies Daly and Chambers, if he wishes to comment on this, I advise Deputy O'Callaghan that he will have to raise the matter directly with the Ceann Comhairle.

The purpose behind all of these grouped amendments is to try to change the proposed legislation, which has within it a proposed mechanism which will have an office of the judicial appointments commission and, within that office, a director and with the office able to retain staff, hire people and, in effect, become a large, expensive quango.  The reason I say it is going to become large expensive quango is that, in the Explanatory Memorandum prepared by the Minister and given to the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, the last paragraph stated that the estimated costs of the office of the judicial appointments commission would be &euro;1 million <i>per annum<\/i>.  When that is compared to the current costs for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, which does the same work, the costs of the JAAB last year were less than &euro;5,000 - a journalist put down a question and got an answer of a figure something over &euro;4,000.<\/p><p>The work that is going to be performed by this new commission is, in substance, no different from the work that has to date been performed by the JAAB and the workload is not considerable.  The function of this new body is to recommend persons it believes are suitable for appointment to judicial office.  I went back and had a look at the reports of the JAAB for the last number of years.  The job of the board in 2016 was to consider people for eight positions on the Judiciary - one on the Court of Appeal, two on the High Court, one on the Circuit Court and four on the District Court.  That is the job it had - to recommend to the Government persons for eight positions.  It is not something for which we need to set up an office that is going to cost us &euro;1 million a year.  It is not a job that requires us to have a director in place who is going to be paid a big salary and who will appear on Sunday morning radio programmes as the director of the office of the judicial appointments commission.<\/p><p>We do not need to go through the tortuous process of setting up this quango.  Therefore, the proposal I have in amendment No. 1 is that we will get rid of this office of director because we do not need it.  At present, the JAAB does its job perfectly well with a secretary - a Mr. Ryan - who performs the function and convenes the meetings.  The board meets three or four times a year to consider applications and make its recommendations.  In 2015 the JAAB report revealed there were 11 appointments in that year and, on average, we are talking about ten, 11 or 12 appointments each year that need to be advised upon by this new body.  I think it an excessive waste of money and waste of time to set up this large structure which will have an office, a director and staff.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to remove &quot;Director&quot; from the definitions.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to remove the definition of &quot;Office&quot; from section 2.  Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert a new position into the definitions section, where, instead of having a director, let us do what we have under the JAAB and have a secretary to the commission.  Amendment No. 96 is a similar amendment, which proposes to change the reference to &quot;Director&quot; to &quot;Secretary&quot;, and amendment No. 97 seeks the same.  In amendment No. 100, I seek to delete &ldquo;Director, a member of staff of the Office&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;, and I seek the same in amendment No. 103.  Amendment No. 109 again seeks to refer to the secretary of the commission as opposed to the director, and the same applies to amendments Nos. 110 to 112, inclusive.  Amendment No. 113 seeks to insert, &quot;The Secretary shall be responsible to the Commission for the performance of his or her functions&quot;.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 180 seeks to delete lines 25 and 26 of page 39 which refer to the review of a procedures committee.  One of the things it is required to do is monitor &quot;the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the Office to the Commission&quot;.  We do not need administrative support provided by an office of a commission whose job is to make recommendations in respect of ten to 15 positions each year.  Amendment No. 184 refers to lines 8 to 10 of page 40.  Again, similar to the previous amendment, this seeks to remove the requirement to ensure the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the office of the commission.  The final amendment, amendment No. 191, has the effect of seeking to remove from the Long Title to the Bill the reference to it setting up an office of a judicial appointments commission.<\/p><p>Irrespective of the differences people may have about how this body should be constituted, the last thing anyone wants to do is set up an unnecessary statutory body that is going to be staffed by more people than it is recommending for positions each year.

We are just creating an unnecessary mini-empire.  The JAAB does the job for less than &euro;5,000 a year.  Why set up this body that is going to cost &euro;1 million?  We should give it to trained judges.

The Deputy also intends to delete sections 32 and 34 in their entirety.  Section 32 provides for the legislative basis and funding arrangements for the administrative support office headed by a director attached to the commission.  The office will be under the control and management of the commission and, subject to the consent of the Minister and approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it may have staff members who would be Civil Service employees.  Section 34 sets out the functions of the director.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 109 to 113, inclusive, would alter section 33 by the substitution of the director with a secretary who, on his or her own without any staff resources or administrative back-up, would be responsible for the workings of the commission.  The amendments would change the term \"Director\" wherever it appears throughout the rest of the Bill with the term \"Secretary\".  This would mean that in place of the director, a secretary would instead, under section 24, be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The same would apply in respect of section 29 which protects against disclosure of confidential information obtained in the course of performing functions as director or members of staff of the judicial appointments commission office and, likewise, in respect of section 30 which safeguards the confidentiality of the proceedings of the commission and its communications.<\/p><p> The amendments would also remove from the Bill the role the Committee on Procedures has under section 58 in monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the office to the commission and the obligation the committee has, following that review, to report to the commission and make recommendations, as necessary, with a view to ensuring the effectiveness of the administrative support.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 191 would change the Long Title in so far as it relates to the establishment of the judicial appointments commission office.<\/p><p> The Schedule sets out further necessary detail regarding the status of the commission as a body corporate; administrative arrangements in respect of the official seal; and what circumstances might cause the director or the Civil Service staff of the director to cease to attach to the office.  We should bear in mind that amendment No. 35 concerns the Schedule which the select committee will discuss later.<\/p><p> I am at somewhat of a loss to understand the logic of the amendments and the proposed deletion of all reference to the office of the new commission and its new director.<\/p><p> The need to ensure value for money in respect of all Exchequer spending goes without saying and no one is in a position to dispute that.  Deputies will know, however, that the issue of inadequate resources was highlighted as part of the review of the current system.  A key element of the submissions made by various stakeholders when the draft Bill was in its early stages and subject to public consultation concerned the provision of a dedicated resource to the new commission.  For example, I examined a submission made in 2014 by the judicial appointments review committee in which the committee stressed the importance of adequate resources to enable the new appointments body to carry out its functions.  The committee, like my office, frequently receives correspondence from various stakeholders in this area commenting on the need to ensure there are proper and adequate resources in place.  More often than not, we are subjected to criticism for a dearth of a resources.<\/p><p> I draw members' attention to the Dublin declaration issued by the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary in May 2012 in which the network underlined the importance of resources in the following statement: \"The body in charge of the selection and appointment of judges must be provided with adequate resources to a level commensurate with the programme of work it is expected to undertake each year and must have independent control over its own budget, subject to the usual requirements as to audit.\"<\/p><p> I understand the GRECO evaluation team has been in contact with the committee.  In its fourth round evaluation report on Ireland in 2014, the team stressed that the new, more profound, selection procedure for the recruitment and promotion of judges needed to be provided with what it described as appropriate resources.<\/p><p> I listened carefully to Deputy O'Callaghan's comments on this matter.  The programme of work to be undertaken by the new commission under the Bill is significant when compared with the current arrangements under the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, system.  These arrangements are resourced from within the Courts Service, with attendant and related costs subsumed in the courts Vote.  It is important that a budget and adequate resources are provided to the commission, that it is independent and that the director and other members of the new body do not feel in any way restricted or compromised in the manner in which they undertake their business.<\/p><p> As I pointed out in response to remarks made during Second Stage, the replacement of the JAAB with a new commission will represent a modest but much needed investment to bring the system into the 21st century.  While I accept Deputy O'Callaghan's point that there may not be a large number of appointments annually, each appointment is of vital importance and could attract scores of applications.  Furthermore, the making of appointments is not the only business the commission will undertake.  The Bill also tasks it with a significant research, development and consultative role to ensure the State has in place and maintains a model of best practice for the selection of members of the Judiciary.  The commission must be kept up to date with and abreast of national and international best practice.  A specialist body of this nature will generate a small staffing requirement and needs adequate resources to function effectively.<\/p><p> For the reasons outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendments, which would have the effect of deleting all references to the office of the new commission and its proposed director.  This would create a fundamental flaw in the legislation before the office had an opportunity to function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#C01200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  Is this change worth a 200-fold increase in the current funding arrangement?  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has a budget of only &euro;5,000, whereas the proposed commission will have a budget of &euro;1 million.  Is a 200-fold increase in funding for the work the Minister describes proportionate?  No one would argue it is proportionate.<\/p> <p>  The commission will appoint a small number of judges.  The funding and other arrangements the Minister proposes amount to a complete bureaucratisation of the Civil Service.  Why can existing resources, for example, staff of the Courts Service or Department, not be transferred to the new office?  The proposal to create such a layered structure is excessive.  The Minister's party expressed pride in abolishing quangos, yet it proposes to create another large quango.  It is proposed is to increase the current budgetary allocation for judicial appointments by a multiple of 200.  Other areas of government and the public service require an increase in funding.  This proposal is excessive and does not correspond with the logical funding arrangements the Minister set out a moment ago.<\/p><p>Research and development will not cost 200 times the cost of &euro;5,000.  I am worried by the funding changes proposed by the Minister in terms of this Civil Service change in the context of other changes within his Department.  For example, the Gambling Control Bill requires significant funding but it has been kicked to touch by his Government.  To propose increasing a cost by 200 times the existing amount for the appointment of ten or 11 judges, on average, is completely excessive.  In my view, the proposal cannot be accepted.  That is why the amendments put forward by Deputy O'Callaghan for a secretary and utilising, for example, the Courts Service or the Department to administer the scheme would be far more appropriate and a better use of State resources.  It is well and good to mention the need for effective research and development but that is the classic speak around the bureaucracy of quangos.  The funding arrangement for the office would only continually grow beyond the proposal of 200 times the cost.  That is why I think the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan are proportionate to the work that the commission will actually do.  The proposal by the Minister is completely excessive and illogical and that is why it is more prudent to take on the amendments that we have proposed.  I do not think anyone can justify in any area of the Civil Service increasing a cost by 200.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#D00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan has made a compelling argument for the amendment.  It is a fairly straightforward body.  If we were talking about a judicial council body then there would be staffing implications and a big volume of work to be done that is not being done now.  I do not see such implications for the present proposal.  Since 2002, there have been 90 appointments to the three superior courts or an average of just over six appointments per year.  Such a workload does not require a permanent office, a director or that type of resource.  As the Minister has said, the office would have a significantly bigger workload than the present arrangement.  I would like his view explained as I do not see any basis for his claim.  I do not know where the hundreds of applications will come from if they do not exist now because all we are changing is the method of appointment.<\/p> <p>  There will not be research into the whole structure of the Judiciary.  The research element is just for judicial appointments, which is not rocket science.  There are examples available from other jurisdictions.  One analyses the nearest peer reviewed study and say, \"Sure maybe we can make that a bit better.\"  The work does not require a permanent office.

Sometimes some of the rhetoric can be unhelpful and not directed at the purpose that a particular body can do.

It is a body that is empowered in a way that the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, is not.  For example, the body will have to engage in the setting out of models of recruitment.  It will have to embark upon selection testing.<\/p> <p>  One of the criticisms of the current judicial appointments procedure is the fact that over the years, since the operation of JAAB, not one interview has taken place even though it is catered for in the legislation.  I would be confident that the situation will change under the new structures, that there will be an interview process and models of selection testing designs.  I am confident that there will be an office albeit modest in form.  The indicative spend is something in the region of &euro;1 million.  That may not well be the case but I would expect that it would be in or about that sum, and probably less.  <\/p> <p>  I have to stress yet again the importance of adequately resourcing a body that will be charged with new responsibilities, new powers, new functions and a new role.  We will be changing, in a fundamental way, the method of appointing members of the Judiciary.  It is not unreasonable that the new commission should be adequately resourced.  In fact, we can look back on a number of pieces of legislation that have passed through this committee in recent times, and in more distant times, where members on all sides repeatedly castigated the Minister for setting up new structures with new authorities, roles, functions and powers but then said they are no good without the resources.<\/p><p>Now an estimate has been given on the matter of resources to ensure that the new office would not be hamstrung in terms of its remit.

To suggest that we will exceed current funding by 200 times that amount is not a fair and adequate reflection of reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#E01600","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The question I wish to put to the Minister is the current cost per annum of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.

Similarly, I am at a loss to understand the logic of excluding people who have expertise from this commission.  The Bill specifically excludes retired judges and people who formerly were lawyers.  Just because they were formally lawyers does not mean they are currently lawyers.  As I mentioned in the D&aacute;il, nobody would call the Minister, Deputy Ross, a stockbroker.  The fact that he was a stockbroker does not mean that he is a stockbroker.  There is no reason to exclude somebody who previously practised or worked as a barrister or solicitor.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 is in the name of Deputy Clare Daly.

I am satisfied that the definition is sufficiently wide to encapsulate any person irrespective of whether he or she is a member of the forces mentioned in Deputy Sherlock's unmoved amendment or a member of the Civil Service, and that any such person will not be considered to be a lay person in the context of the Bill and to be in a position to be appointed as a lay member of the commission.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers seeks to delete the provision that a lay person shall not have held any judicial office.

A reading of the section will show that it has been carefully structured to allow a lay person who was practising as a barrister or solicitor in a period of 15 years or more prior to the appointment to be considered to be a lay person.  On balance, this is a proportionate provision and appropriately reflects what I believe to be an accepted sense of what we mean by &quot;lay person&quot;.  I would have thought that one of the requirements for someone to fulfil the definition of a lay person would be for him or her to be a non-legal person.  That is the import of the legislation.  A lay person cannot just have been a practising solicitor or barrister.  That would not be in keeping with the careful balance around which the commission is structured.<\/p><p>It is my belief that, when we refer to lay people, we are discussing people who are separate and distinct from the legal profession.

This relates to amendments Nos. 33 and 34 in the name of Deputy Daly.  They seek to modify the membership of the commission in section 12 by replacing two of the six lay members with nominees of the ICCL and FLAC instead of having the members recruited through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.<\/p> <p>  I have a difficulty with amendment No. 6 in so far as the strategy for selection of the lay members in the Bill is to have them selected independently and professionally by the PAS in accordance with their experience and expertise, which are criteria set out in section 12.  The reasonable intention is to get as wide as possible a mix and coverage of the desired skills and experience among the cohort of lay members who might be appointed.  The PAS will be selecting from a wide pool of potential applicants, including people who have experience in the organisations referred to by Deputy Daly.  It is open to them to apply should they deem it appropriate or desirable.  The application process would not just be open to the organisations named in the amendment, but also to similar organisations working in like fields.<\/p> <p>  The PAS will use the selection process to screen the suitability and experience of candidates in a way that would probably not be done in a nomination process.<\/p><p>We have sufficient experience, either at Government level or at Houses of the Oireachtas level, for us to be assured that when it comes to the appointment of persons who are recommended by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, they will have been carefully and independently selected.

On balance, I believe that categories of expertise and experiences as set out in section 15 of the Bill, as requisites for what we describe as lay members, adequately covers these areas.

In section 15 of the Bill, which deals with the selection categories, there is specific reference in subsection (7) to the categories of people having experience in human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity among members of society; commerce, finance or administration, including public administration; board membership and corporate governance; and professional dispute resolution or mediation activities.<\/p><p>We will undertake to give the matter further consideration but I do not want to form the view that we are immediately or implacably opposed to the points raised.  I do not want to act in any way that might be exclusive of certain or other organisations.<\/p><p>This brings me to Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 69, to section 15, which requires PAS, when recommending persons for appointment as lay people on the commission, to have regard to matters of gender equality and population diversity.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that some consideration needs to be given in this regard.  I am anxious to look at other legislation.  For example, the Act providing for the setting up the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a specific reference to gender equality.  Let us look at that legislation to see if we can agree something for Report Stage.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 states:<\/p><blockquote>In making recommendations for appointment of persons to the Commission under this section, the Service, and the Government shall have regard to the need to ensure that the members of the Commission broadly reflect the nature of Irish society and that such persons possess knowledge of, or experience in... matters connected with human rights...<\/blockquote> <p>If we agree to look at a similar provision for Report Stage, which I believe would meet the import of Deputy Wallace's amendment, it would also address many of the issues referred to by Deputy Daly in this group of amendments and later on in the Bill.  If Members consider that the 15 year bar is unduly restrictive or draconian, we could look at it also.<\/p><p>With regard to amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies Jim O' Callaghan and Jack Chambers, it is very difficult to sustain publicly a popular view as to how a former judge who has practiced as a judge in the courts for many decades could be regarded as a non-legal person consequent to their retirement or leaving the Bench.  I believe there is a challenge around how they could be immediately described as a lay person.<\/p><p>It is equally difficult to sustain a position that a person who is not currently a practising barrister or solicitor but who was recently engaged full-time in either of those professions could suddenly be regarded as a non-legal person and therefore regarded as a lay person.  There is a difficulty there and we need to meet it in a way that ensures public confidence in what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#J00800","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I am inclined to agree with the Minister's last point.  For example, at the moment if we avail of a former judge to chair a commission - and we are running out of them for commissions of investigation currently - we still regard them as being legal.  If they are a former judge, we assume and we see them more on the legal side than on the lay side.  I would agree with the Minister's point in that respect.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 69, I was a bit surprised that my amendment was put in this group of amendments, although there is a link with Deputy Daly's amendment.  From my point of view they are actually linked to other amendments that I have tabled.  Amendment No. 69 provides that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, should have regard to &quot;... the objective that the membership should comprise equal numbers of men and women&quot;.  That may be a consideration in the overall commission, including lay and legal members.  This part of the amendment is pretty self-explanatory and it ensures that we try to have equal numbers of men and women as lay members.  The second part of the amendment says that consideration should also include &quot;the objective that the membership should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole&rdquo;.  That is very broad and I have dealt with it more specifically when dealing with other parts of the legislation.  I thought those amendments might have gone together.<\/p><p>For example, in section 15(5) there is a provision that when selecting the six lay members for the judicial appointments commission, the PAS will have regard to whether the candidates have knowledge or experience of the matters set out in section 15(7)<i>(a)<\/i>to <i>(g<\/i>).  Subsection <i>(d<\/i>) refers to the processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations.  Subsection (<i>f<\/i>) refers to board membership and corporate governance.  The amendment to propose the removal of subsections (<i>d<\/i>) and (<i>f<\/i>) was drafted to remove any requirement or desire by PAS for candidates to have experience in public sector appointments, board membership and corporate governance, with a view to broadening the potential for the PAS to pick outside of the usual career civil servants or retired civil servants who would be likely to have experience in these areas.  This would encourage as broad and diverse an approach as possible by the PAS rather than restricting the PAS only to candidates who have such experience, and it would minimise the potential for public sector groupthink within the commission.<\/p><p>We do not want the commission to be stacked with civil servants.  The Minister, Deputy Ross was at pains to tell Deputies that one of the driving desires behind this Bill was to depoliticise the selection of judges but I am afraid that it could make it even more politicised.  If the lay members of the commission are going to be creatures of government, and we would argue civil servants tend to be such creatures, then the paws of government may be strengthen in how judges are to be selected.<\/p><p>The judicial appointments commission is unique and would be best served by a diverse membership with a dynamic and innovative approach to decision making.  The inclusion of lay members with little or no experience of public sector appointments processes or board memberships would be preferable.  This is also the reasoning behind the amendment affecting <i>(e<\/i>), which is amendment No. 67, to remove reference to public administration and to include civil society and trade union activity.  I understand that we will deal with this amendment later on.  This would encourage the PAS to cast the net wider for lay members from these backgrounds rather than seeking lay members from the finance, commerce and public administration sectors as is currently proposed in subsection (<i>e<\/i>) drafted by the Government.  I argue that this would avoid and move away from the amount of political influence in how judges are appointed.  I believe that taking this approach will be positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#K00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I want to ask the Minister about retired judges.

I will respond to Deputy O'Callaghan first.  My political views are entirely in accordance with the programme for Government, as a Member of the Government that agreed the programme.  This legislation is an important component of the programme for Government.  It is challenging to sustain a position that a member of the Judiciary who for one reason or another steps down from that role can suddenly be categorised as a non-legal person.  This is a challenge for public perception.  I take the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan about retired judges serving the public well after their retirement.  It is fair to say that if one looks across the current panel of retired judges in Irish society most of them are actively engaged in some form of commission of investigation or other.  The matter of their appointment is associated with their careers as judges.  From time to time they are described as a retired, eminent, legal figure or a retired, eminent member of the Judiciary.  There is a difficulty in regarding these retired judges as lay persons or non-legal persons.  Where Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment is concerned, this perception presents us with a difficulty.  I believe that it is hard to sustain a view that having served the State well for decades a retired, eminent judge can suddenly be regarded as a lay person or a non-legal person.  It is hard to sustain that view and I would have a difficulty in that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment, I will look at it again.  The Deputy made references to other matters in the latter part of his contribution that I will address later.  I will not detain the committee now as we will come back to those issues later in the debate.  We are currently discussing amendment No. 69 and I do not disagree at all with the intention of the Deputy.  I will look at a similar type of construct in other legislation such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which I have already mentioned.<\/p><p>In fairness to the Bill as drafted, we have made specific reference to ensuring that the Public Appointments Service considers certain matters, which I believe are robust and meet most of the concerns of Deputy Wallace.  In regard to the concerns that are not met, I will consider them between now and Report Stage.<\/p><p> I do not disagree with the intention behind his amendment.  I do not want to be unduly restrictive either.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment No. 6 is still under consideration.  I am trying to be helpful.

If I were to accept the import of Deputy Daly's amendment, we could be faced with a proposition that if the nominees of a number of organisations that are mentioned happened to be lawyers, I do not believe we can therefore automatically regard these people as being lay members of the commission.  In terms of the objective, what we want to do is the same but we need to do that without being unduly restrictive or without having consequences that are not intended by the amendment.<\/p><p> I will not accept the amendment but I will look at the issues raised by Deputies Daly and Wallace in the context of Report Stage, having regard to the points they made with which I do not disagree. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#K00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 4 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#L00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#L00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508313600,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;, and in the relevant period specified by <i>subsection (2) <\/i>for the purposes of this paragraph, was not,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#L00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1508313600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>We now come to amendment No. 6.

Subsequent amendments, to which we will come to consider presently, seek the deletion of other committees that are referred to in the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to make the statutory process much simpler.  As I mentioned in respect of the first amendment, there is only a series of limited appointments upon which the commission will be asked to advise each year.  As I mentioned earlier, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB in its 2016 report advised of its work on eight positions.  In the 2015 report there were 11 appointments arising from the work of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes a structure of a &quot;Procedures Committee&quot; and separate committees for each individual court.  There will be a District Court committee, a Circuit Court committee, a High Court committee and committees for the other courts.  My view is this will make the process unnecessarily complicated.  It is important to have one group of people who are assessing the applications that come in.  I do not think it is necessary to have separate committees to consider separate applications.  The committee may think that a candidate who has applied for a Circuit Court position may not be suitable for that position but would be suitable for a position in the District Court, for which he or she also may have applied.

Their purpose is to remove the notion that the chair has to be a lay person.  We are proposing a situation in which the chair will be picked by the committee.  There is too much focus in the Bill on always having a lay majority.  For example, the proposed amendments to sections 18(5), 19(2) and 19(5) propose to remove the requirement that the quorum be made up of a lay majority and that the procedures committee and any other sub-committee have a lay majority.  There may well end up being a quorum with a lay majority and a procedures committee and a subcommittee with a lay majority but I do not see the need to require this in advance in legislation.<\/p> <p>  The Bar Council submission refers to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and its statement that the procedure for the appointment of judges should be transparent and independent in practice.

In order to safeguard its independence, rules should ensure that its members are selected by the Judiciary and that the authority decides itself on its procedural rules.  There is deliberately too much focus in the Government's approach, both publicly and in these kind of legislative amendments, on promoting a populist lay-versus-law tension which serves the Government well in distracting the media and public from the fact that Government control of judicial appointments may be strengthened by this Bill.

The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to delete the definition of the procedures committee in section 2 of the Bill.  Several amendments are directly related.  Many of these are drafting amendments in the group.  I note that section 19 of the Bill is opposed, which is the section of the Bill that sets up the procedures committee.  The main effect of these changes, if they are to be favourably considered, is to remove from the Bill the process relating to the procedures committee but to retain the functions the Bill envisages the procedures committee would have and to assign these features or functions to the commission.<\/p> <p>  Related amendments have the effect of removing sections 53(1), 55(1) and 55(2) which are the requirements of the procedures committee to consult with court presidents in respect of specified matters which are the subject of Part 8 of the Bill.  It is assumed the changes sought relate to amendments that separately have the effect of conferring membership of the commission on all court presidents, including the Chief Justice.  Amendments Nos. 168 and 178 also seek to remove particular interactions between the commission and the procedures committee in sections 55 and 57(4) which would not arise as a result of the removal from the Bill of the general provisions relating to the procedures committee.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would remove from the review and recommendations functions set out in Part 8 matters relating to the administrative support provided by the office of the commission as envisaged in section 58(1)(a)(iv) and section 58(4)(d) respectively.  These amendments relate to further amendments that separately remove from the Bill the provisions relating to the office of the judicial commission and the director as provided under Part 5, and which we will be discussing separately.<\/p> <p>  Section 56 is opposed by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and Chambers.  This section provides for the approval by the commission of statements prepared by the procedures committee and this is consequential on amendments sought to Part 8 of the Bill which substitute the commission for the procedures committee in the discharge of functions under that part of the Bill.  I am not inclined to accept these amendments.<\/p> <p>  I will clearly state for the benefit of the committee the central purpose of the procedures committee.  This arises from a core provision of the Bill in section 12(2).  Section 12(2) provides that the two key general functions of the Commission will be to select and recommend persons to the Minister for appointment to judicial office and for that purpose, to approve a statement of selection procedures and a statement of requisite skills and attributes for inclusion in a published statement.<\/p> <p>  In the case of the first function, the task of selecting and recommending persons to the Minister for appointment to judicial office is to be performed by the relevant committees under section 10.  This aspect of the Bill is not the subject of the amendments that we are currently discussing.  The second function is to be performed by the procedures committee established under section 19 to carry out the detail of that function as provided for under Part 8.   The immediate impact of the amendments we are now discussing is to remove from the Bill any role for the procedures committee and to provide that the commission fulfils those functions.  The commission, as is apparently envisaged by the Deputies under separate amendments, is structured differently from that provided for by the Bill.  It is useful to note that the Deputies see the need for the work that is planned under Part 8 and which is part of the dual function nature of the commission.  Clearly we disagree on the most effective and appropriate manner of discharging that function.   <\/p> <p>  The second general function of the commission as provided for under section 12(2) is a vital one.  The Bill contains immediate adjustments to the appointments structure that has been operating for the past 20 years or so.  Under the function we are discussing, the Bill also sets up a new and much needed mechanism to further develop and implement improvements and reforms as the justice and social and economic environments evolve.  The process of developing and reviewing selection procedures and requisite skills and attributes is an organic one and one which will require relatively specialised and dedicated attention to ensure best practice is continually rolled out across the judicial appointments function and is regularly reviewed and updated.  We only have to go back to the previous amendments and the points raised by Deputies Daly and Wallace, all of which are valid, to see that.  It is good that Deputies appear to acknowledge the need for this ongoing development function that is envisaged.  <\/p> <p>  It is very significant that we have a commission working through a procedures committee as provided under section 19 that will have the function of determining in a fully consultative manner, new procedures for the selection of judges and the skills and attributes required of those being selected for recommendation to the Minister.  It is the intention that the procedures to be developed by the procedures committee will reflect best practice for professional selection methods and approaches.  Given the constantly evolving environment within which the judicial process operates and the constant development of norms and standards nationally and internationally, it is critical to see this important function as not just a one-off task.  This feeds into the earlier discussion about the resources being made available to the various components of the commission.  <\/p> <p>  Under Part 8, the committee will have the ongoing role of reviewing the effectiveness of the selection system as well as the effectiveness of the functions assigned to the commission under the Bill.  These include such matters as the adequacy of the support resource that the Bill assigns, specifically the commission office and director.  We will be discussing later the importance of that support in the context of amendments the Deputies have tabled with regard to those matters.<\/p> <p>  The policy vision underpinning the establishment of and assignment of functions to the procedures committee system are core elements of the Bill and I am not inclined to accept a change in approach here.<\/p><p>The Bill allows for a dedicated structure to support this necessary function and allows for real attention and focus to be given to system review and process improvement.  While the emphasis is on best practice, we need a model that can be devised and open to improvements over time.<\/p><p> Part 8 is about a progressive approach to reform, allowing for further development of the selection procedures and informed with reference to best international practice.  Under section 19, the procedures committee will be composed of seven members of the commission with a lay majority and a lay chairperson.  Its functions are vital.  While I accept this would appear to be acknowledged by the Deputies whose amendments seek to retain essentially the function but change the entity performing the function, I cannot agree with that change.<\/p><p> It may be worth looking in a little more detail at what the procedures committee will do under Part 8.  It will have two main tasks to perform.  First, under section 55, the procedures committee will be required to prepare a statement for approval by the commission, setting out the procedures for selecting persons for appointment and a statement of requisite skills and attributes that the person must possess to be suitable for selection.  The Bill requires consultation in respect of this task, including with the courts' presidents.  It sets out certain matters the committee should have regard to, including the objective that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, and, to the extent feasible and practical, it should reflect diversity within the population as a whole, a point stressed by Deputy Wallace in his earlier amendment and with which I do not disagree.<\/p><p> Section 55 provides for certain essential requirements in the area of judicial competence which must be reflected in the statement.  These include an ability to conduct proceedings in a manner which ensures the public's confidence in the administration of justice and practical considerations that affect the experience of lay persons in the court system.  Before approving or refusing to approve statements prepared by the committee, the commission is required to consult with the Minister.  These statements must, under section 57, be published, if approved within 12 months, or 18 months at most, from the commencement of the provisions.<\/p><p> The second key task of the committee is to review the operation of the published statement, the effectiveness of the requirements for selection and the adequacy of functions assigned to the commission, among other matters.  It must also report to the commission on the outcome of its review two years after the commencement of the provisions.  Any such report may include any recommendation relating to the implementation of the Act.  The commission will be required to submit the report and its recommendations, together with any observations it may have, to the Minister.<\/p><p> Colleagues on the committee will acknowledge these are relatively complex tasks given the indicated timeframes.  I anticipate the procedures committee will be required to move quite early and provide what will ultimately be a substantial piece of work.  The commission working through the relevant committees, as provided under the Bill, will also need to move early after the commencement of the provisions to address any requests to fill judicial vacancies.<\/p><p> The smaller iteration of the commission in the form of a procedures committee would be more suited to perform the longer-term ongoing function and system development.  In terms of good governance, it is critical that a reporting line is in place to ensure the commission will have the definitive say regarding matters concerned.  A more nimble, or more relatively specialised, procedures committee reporting, as required, to the overall commission is a structure which allows for effectiveness, delivery, transparency and accountability within the overall governance structure as provided.<\/p><p> I acknowledge I have a different view to the proponents of these amendments as to the structure of the commission.  In many respects, it is a separate argument.  In terms of the Government's policy, the commission has a particular composition which makes it ideally placed to act at a different level to the procedures committee, to perform an approval function in respect of statements prepared by the committee, as provided for under section 56, as well as the power to modify or refuse to approve such statements.<\/p><p> On a separate matter, I believe the commission should be required to consult with the Minister in this regard as provided for under section 56(3).  I note that section is also opposed by several Deputies.  I fail to see why that should be the case.  The Minister is responsible for the administration of justice and has overall responsibility in the matters of law and policy relating to judicial appointment procedures.<\/p><p> As for the particular composition of the commission for which the Bill provides, it is critical the consultation arrangements between the procedures committee and the courts' presidents are maintained.  These would be removed by Opposition amendments Nos. 162 and 168.  Given the composition of the commission as provided for, I have a difficulty in accepting these amendments.<\/p><p> One of the outcomes of the amendments we are discussing is that the commission would effectively approve its own statements prepared under section 55(1).  That is a further reason it would be illogical for me to accept them.<\/p><p> It is a significant advance to have in place on a permanent basis a commission, part of the remit of which will be to develop fully professionalised selection processes.  In the interests of specialisation, transparency, good governance and practical common sense, this task requires the structure as provided for under the Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments which in effect will remove from the Bill the role of the procedures committee as set out.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 in the name of Deputy Wallace seek to remove from section 19(2) and 19(5) the stipulation that the procedures committee of the commission, or any other committee of the commission, should contain a majority of lay members and a lay chairperson, as determined by the commission.  The effect of these amendments would mean that neither the procedures committee, which deals with the critical area of designing and setting out selection procedures and processes, nor any other committee, would have to reflect the lay majority or lay chairperson composition of the commission.  It would probably have the effect of going against the grain of the overall policy approach of the Bill.  Will Deputy Wallace reflect on those as I cannot accept them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#M00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>This is another example of how the Minister is overcomplicating a relatively simple function.

Even the Minister must accept that the length of time required to provide an explanation to justify the procedures committee indicates that it is excessively complicated.  The first amendment in my name and that of Deputy Jack Chambers attempts to prevent the establishment of the committee as it would be too bureaucratic and there would be a mini empire of directors and so on appearing on radio shows and similar.  The Minister has got that.  However, he is proposing to set up separate committees within the commission.  There will be a report from the procedures committee and another from the District Court committee.  There will be a chairman of the procedures committee.  Instead of only the director of the Judicial Appointments Commission appearing on &quot;The Marian Finucane Show&quot;, he or she will be joined by the chairman of the procedures committee of the Judicial Appointments Commission.

The judicial appointments process needs to be reformed and I introduced legislation on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il in that respect.  For that process to be satisfactorily performed would require it to be done for a relatively small amount of money and without having a variety of committees.  It would be done by having a board of 11 or 12 members who meet three or four times a year to make recommendations to Government.  I am concerned that the mechanism proposed in this legislation will make the process complicated beyond what is necessary for recommending eight or nine people for appointment.The amendments aim to remove the procedures committee from the legislation.  It is just one of the many committees dealt with in the legislation but there is no necessity for it.

However, I am not so sure that argument applies to the procedures committee, which is what this group of amendments addresses.<\/p> <p>  Although I could be wrong, the Minister seems to be saying that the procedures committee will be set up at the start to decide on the criteria for selection.  That will be its main job and it will not have much to do apart from that.  A smaller body would probably be in a better position to get things up and running fairly quickly that than a larger one.  I have less sympathy for these amendments than those in the next grouping and I would like to hear more about them.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the points made by Deputy Wallace regarding an overemphasis on the issue of lay members versus legal members.  The real issue is that of political appointees and it is that with which members of the public have a problem.  I favour having a lay majority but by concentrating on these issues, we are missing the elephant in the room, namely, who will be appointed as judges rather than how they will be appointed.  Being made a judge is career progression for those in the legal profession.  Given the background from which judges are drawn, they are a class apart from the rest of society.  Having a lay majority is an attempt to break through that.  It is not just about appointment as a judge being career progression for those in the legal profession but that judges should better reflect the diverse views and backgrounds of society as a whole.  Studies show there is a better chance of getting that if there is a lay majority on the commission because it otherwise becomes self-replicating in that judges think they are doing a great job, which many of them are, but they do not see the lack of representation of wider society as a problem.  They might be great judges and make good decisions but there could also be more diversity.  Some of those issues need to be reflected upon.<\/p> <p>  There is more of a basis for the procedures committee to remain than other relevant committees but I am open to hearing more on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#O00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I hold an almost identical position to that of Deputy Clare Daly in that some other committees are perhaps unnecessary and it might be possible for the commission to do much of the work of committees attached to each court.  However, the procedures committee has the strongest case of all the committees in terms of its working to ensure that the process is representative and that there is diversity and so on.  While I accept that it may be more relevant to the next group of amendments, it would be sensible to have a commission that would be responsible for the appointment of all judges and a strong procedures committee might ensure greater consistency in the approach to appointments than might ensue from there being four different committees, each dealing with a different level of court.  I favour a commission and a procedures committee.  Whatever about the other committees, there is a logic to having a procedures committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#O00400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":712,"content":"<p> There are many matters that relate to amendments Nos. 84 and 85 in my name.

He or she is selected by the Public Appointments Service.  That may allow a certain amount of Government influence but it is probably the most independent body in the country, has a say on its own budget and cannot be removed by the Government.  The Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would be a very strong person to have on the committee and having six lay people and six legal professionals to make up the 13-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017101800002#O00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1508313600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Deputy Wallace.
