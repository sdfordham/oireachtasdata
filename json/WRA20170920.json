This standard is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment &ndash; or &ldquo;SAFE&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>The SAFE standard has four levels: <\/p><p>Safe 0= No assurance of identity.<\/p><p>Safe 1= Balance of probabilities (the minimum authentication level for the allocation of a PPS Number).<\/p><p>Safe 2= Substantial assurance (the minimum authentication level for issuing a Public Services Card).<\/p><p>Safe 3= Beyond reasonable doubt.<\/p><p>The Department operates a number of methods to SAFE 2 register a person.  The usual method involves a combination of all of the following &ndash;<\/p><p>-a face-to-face meeting,<\/p><p>-the collection and  verification of the person&rsquo;s Public Service Identity (PSI) data set, <\/p><p>-the examination\/validation\/verification of at least two documents supporting identity, and <\/p><p>-photo capture and matching.  <\/p><p>As part of the verification process the person&rsquo;s photo is run through software to check against other photos that have already been taken during other SAFE 2 registrations.  This is to detect and\/or prevent duplicate registrations.<\/p><p>Once a person completes a SAFE 2 registration they may be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC) as a physical token that proves they have had their identity verified to the SAFE 2 standard.  Additionally, a person may be issued with a verified MyGovID account, which is a secure online account for accessing public services digitally, and again proves in the online environment that the person has had their identity verified to the SAFE 2 standard.  The PSC and MyGovID, in turn, enable individuals gain access to high value and personalised public services, in person and electronically, more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while preserving privacy and security.  In the case of services provided by my Department, the PSC is being used to replace the Social Services Card and paper Free Travel pass and MyGovID is being used to provide access to an increasing number of welfare services online at <i>www.mywelfare.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Accordingly, SAFE Level 2 registration allows a person to verify their identity once for public service purposes because it is to a substantial level of assurance.  Consequently, it eliminates the need for a person to repeatedly register their identity information when accessing public services.  It makes it more difficult for someone else to claim to be a person and so helps to eliminate &ldquo;identity theft&rdquo; and fraudulent access to someone else&rsquo;s data.<\/p><p>The primary legislative provisions for SAFE registration and identity verification are set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended) as follows &ndash; <\/p><p>-Sections 262 and 263B provide for the verification of identity for issuance and use of a PPS Number. <\/p><p>-Sections 263, 263A and 263B provide for the verification of identity for issuance, use and cancellation of a PSC. <\/p><p>-Section 241 provides that a person must satisfy the Minister as to his\/her identity when making a new claim. <\/p><p>-Section 247C provides that an existing claimant must satisfy the Minister as to his\/her identity and provides for disqualification where an existing claimant fails to so do.  <\/p><p>In other words, the legislation requires a person to satisfy the Minister as to their identity and allows for disallowance or disqualification from receipt of a benefit in the event that it is not done.  It is not possible for a claimant to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity without registering to SAFE 2.  Given that my Department spends over &euro;19bn p.a. on supports and services, we need to be sure that people who access these services are the people who are entitled to receive them and that they don&rsquo;t access them multiple times under different identities.  Accordingly, it is reasonable to ask people to verify their identity to a substantial level of assurance.  <\/p><p>Where a customer is invited to satisfy the Minister as to their identity in the manner prescribed in law, the customer is required to engage with that process.  The Department makes it clear to customers in receipt of social welfare payments or Free Travel entitlements that they do need to complete a SAFE 2 registration to access, or continue to access, payments and entitlements.  In the main, customers are invited to a scheduled registration appointment, completion of which results in the issue of a PSC by post.  The Department also issues reminder letters to customers, as required.  Customers may also book a different time\/date to suit them, either online via <i>www.mywelfare.ie<\/i>, by contacting the Department&rsquo;s offices, or by walking in to ask for the next available appointment.  <\/p><p>While the default SAFE 2 registration method is &lsquo;face-to-face&rsquo; (as set out at Sections 263B, 241 and 247C (3) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended), the Department can and does make other arrangements with certain customers, where appropriate, to elevate their identity verification to the SAFE 2 standard.  Combining high quality public service identity data with risk analysis and customer consent can, in some circumstances, allow the Department to complete the process by post rather than face-to-face.  These alternative methods are further strengthened in that all photographs are subjected to facial image matching against previously held photographs.  Additionally, the Department operates a mobile registration solution to cater for those persons incapable (for whatever reason) of attending a Department office.  Although this approach works best in congregated environments, individual registrations (for example at a person&rsquo;s residence) can be undertaken in exceptional circumstances.  In this context, I want to make it clear that customers who face bona fide challenges to in-person attendance will not be disadvantaged, in terms of access to payments and\/or availing of Free Travel entitlements. <\/p><p>The Department is in the process of completing SAFE 2 registration of its entire existing customer base.  As the Department is in a roll-out phase and as its customer base is not static, this is an ongoing process.  Accordingly, there are people in payment that have not yet been invited to SAFE 2 register and not all first time applicants are yet required to SAFE 2 register before being put in payment.  However, over time, as the rollout phase completes, all customers of the Department&rsquo;s schemes will be required to be SAFE 2 registered.<\/p><p>The Department does not collect data on the number of individuals who currently, or who, at any point in time, have had a payment stopped by reason of failing to complete the SAFE 2 registration process.  This data is fluid in nature.  <\/p><p>For example, a considerable number of customers who have a payment or entitlement suspended or stopped subsequently decide to complete the SAFE2 process and have their payment or entitlement reinstated.  It should be noted that of the remainder, a considerable portion do not make any contact with the Department.  The decision to stop a payment is never made lightly.

The rate of payment to a person is related to the number of contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person. Entitlement levels are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.    As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, the current rate bands for State pension (contributory) claims were introduced.  These did not change the rate of payment for those who would have qualified for a maximum rate pension under the old rate bands, nor those with a yearly average of 40-47 who continue to qualify at the 98% rate of payment.  <\/p>  <p>  Those affected, therefore, are all pensioners with a yearly average of less than 40 contributions.  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s direct question, none of these would have qualified for a full contributory pension had they retired under the old rate bands.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that some 557 pensioners currently resident in Wexford are paid under the new rate-bands at a somewhat lower percentage rate than applied under claims made in 2000-2012.  It is important to note that these pensioners would not have qualified for a full rate pension under the previous rate bands either.<\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands replaced previous rates introduced in 2000 and more accurately reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person.  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  <\/p>  <p>  There are very significant income and capital disregards in respect of both of those payments, and the large majority of recipients of the non-contributory pension and the IQA payment on a contributory pension are paid at the maximum rate.

Reflecting the impact of Government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, the unemployment rate has fallen rapidly since it peaked at 15.1% in Q1 2012.  The most recent figure is 6.8% in Q1 2017, and unemployment has fallen by more than half in every region of the country over this period.  A strong downward trend continues.  In Q2 2016, the unemployment rate as measured by the QNHS was 8.6%.  The Census of Population 2016 Summary Results - Part 2, published on 15 June 2017 (based on Census night 24th April 2016) provided an alternative measure of unemployment levels and indicated an unemployment rate of 12.7%.   The main difference in the unemployment rate between the two sources arises as the classifications used in the measurement of unemployment differ for both. <\/p>  <p>  In the QNHS, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification is used and defines employment, unemployment and the inactive population.  Unemployment is defined as persons who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work.<\/p>  <p>  The Census uses the Principal Economic Status (PES) classification to establish the labour force situation of the respondent.  The PES classification is based on how respondents would describe their present principal status including a status of being unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these differences, a strength of the census-based data on employment and unemployment is the provision of data for small geographic areas, and analysis on the comparisons between areas.  Based on this, the latest census report has identified the 79 District Electoral Divisions (DEDs) with the highest levels of unemployment as &ldquo;unemployment blackspots&rdquo;.  The DEDs involved vary greatly in population size (ranging from about 490 to about 8,400) and other characteristics.  They are, however, predominantly the DEDs  of highest unemployment within larger urban areas; over half of the blackspots, and over half of the population resident in blackspots, is in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which through public and private sector collaboration seek to build on existing strengths and assets and identify opportunities within each region, and realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets. <\/p>  <p>  As an example of measures to support the regional jobs agenda, additional funds will be made available through the enterprise development agencies out to 2020.  In this context, a competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund 2017-2020 was launched in May 2017, providing funding of up to &euro;60 million to co-finance the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This regional competitive fund will support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  In addition, additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy continues to prioritise actions for the newly unemployed and also includes a range of measures for the long-term unemployed.  This includes the payment-by-results services of JobPath to engage more systematically with the long-term unemployed; providing targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; with a high concentration of unemployment, it is important to recognise that DEASP services through Intreo are focused on unemployed individuals rather than on areas.  <\/p>  <p>  This means, nonetheless, that those areas where unemployed individuals are most concentrated will also be the areas that receive a greater share of DEASP income support payments and activation and employment services. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Census shows that the concentration of unemployment in &lsquo;blackspots&rsquo; is related to issues such as low educational attainment; housing tenure; and other markers of disadvantage.  Where there is a high spatial concentration of blackspots, such as in Limerick, there are overarching strategies in place.  For example, the Limerick Regeneration Plan includes a range of measures to address the multitude of issues present in these areas.  More generally, measures are in place across a range of policy fields, such as education and childcare, to focus enhanced support on areas of identified disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000060#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000060#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[39583\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000060#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the actions being taken by her Department to tackle long waiting times for the processing of domiciliary care allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>The Department is currently experiencing delays in the processing of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) claims.

Accordingly, the Department developed the project in phases and prepared costs and staffing requirements once they became known through these various phases.  The first phase of the project from 2005 to 2007 involved the research and design of a card, the development of the detailed functional specification required for the Public Services Card (PSC), and a project proposal for the development and deployment of the PSC and associated infrastructure.  In 2007, the second phase, to procure a managed services contract for the production of the card, began and was completed in 2009.  This then provided the Department with definitive costs for this element of the project.The third phase was the operation of a trial or pilot to test how registration processes and card production facilities would work in practice.  Once this was completed in 2011, it was then possible to determine the staffing levels that would be required to undertake the customer registration processes countrywide.  It would not have been possible to determine the staffing requirement in advance of this phase.

The registration process also offers the most robust identity proofing process to protect personal data used within Government.  As such it is Government policy that SAFE registration is required for access to all services that require proof of a person&rsquo;s identity.  The SAFE 2 process is essential for Ireland to be aligned with the EC EIDAS legislation, which is a key aspect of the EC eGovernment Action Plan and Digital Single Market Strategy.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The SAFE 2 registration process involves a face-to-face interaction; the verification and capture of the Public Service Identity (PSI) data set, the examination\/validation\/verification of at least two documents supporting identity, and photo-matching.  <\/p>  <p>  Taken individually, neither a passport, nor a driver&rsquo;s license, nor a birth certificate is enough to validate an identity to SAFE Level 2.

Meeting this target means lifting 102,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty. 2015 saw the first reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty since 2008. Compared to 2014, in 2015 there was a 13,000 or approximately 9 per cent decrease in the number of children in consistent poverty. The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures. As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2016 and 2017 become available. The Government continues to focus on activation, to help people back into the workforce.    However, it is clear that the target to reduce child poverty by more than 100,000 children, or two thirds of the 2011 rate, is ambitious and may not be met.  <\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers.  <\/p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health and childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000061#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":103,"content":"<p>Question No. 73 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Communications","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[39631\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his telephone conversation with President el-Sisi of Egypt regarding a person (details supplied).","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>I spoke with Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi by telephone on Monday 28 August.<\/p><p>The call was instigated at my request to discuss the case of Irish Citizen, Ibrahim Halawa.

I made clear the Government&rsquo;s objective that there should be no new impediments to the all-island economy which has been able to develop over the last two decades and which is a gain of the peace process that benefits communities across the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Missions","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD03000"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[39031\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD03100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent trade mission to Canada; if he will further report on his meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau; and the issues that were discussed.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>I travelled to Canada between 19-23 August.<\/p>  <p>  My visit commenced in Montr&eacute;al with an official welcoming ceremony and a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister.  During our meeting we discussed the provisional implementation of CETA which commences tomorrow, September 21.  We discussed the latest developments on Brexit and Ireland's priorities in the negotiations.  Prime Minister Trudeau updated me on the latest state of play with regards to the NAFTA negotiations.  In the context of a wider conversation on healthcare, I updated the Prime Minister on plans to hold a constitutional referendum on the Eighth Amendment.  We also discussed Climate Change and reaffirmed both our countries' commitment to the Paris Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Following our meeting, Prime Minister Trudeau and I walked together in the Fiert&eacute; Montr&eacute;al Pride Parade.  I also met with leaders and representatives of the Irish community in Montr&eacute;al and wider Quebec region, before travelling to Toronto.<\/p>  <p>  In Toronto I had a number of business engagements including a business breakfast event attended by 150 contacts of the joint hosts, Enterprise Ireland, the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce and the Ireland Funds.

That is particularly true of Government Departments and public service bodies in all countries, given the impact of their activities on the lives of citizens.  That is why communications should be treated as a strategic, whole of government activity which should be conducted to the same level of professionalism as any other activity, such as human resource management or financial management.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland should aspire to meet best international practice, and we are seeking to draw on the experience of other countries in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The new Strategic Communications Unit aims to help achieve that, over time.<\/p>  <p>  It will be integrated within the Civil Service structures in my Department, with the Director of the unit reporting to the Secretary General of the Department.  A high-level working group, chaired by the Secretary General, will be established to ensure successful oversight and delivery of the workplan of the unit.<\/p>  <p>  Further cross-Departmental oversight will be provided by the Civil Service Management Board.<\/p>  <p>  The operating principles for the unit will ensure that it does not engage in any party political work.<\/p>  <p>  The unit will convene briefings and consultations across Government, including with Ministers, and with wider stakeholders, as appropriate.  A network of communications professionals from across Government will be developed to share best practice and develop continuing professional development for the communication function.<\/p>  <p>  The unit has commenced work but further organisational change will be required before it is fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  The current staff of the unit is made up of six serving public and civil servants, assigned on secondment or through reallocation of internal resources within the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is headed by a Director, on secondment from a state agency, at Assistant Secretary level.  The other five staff have been reassigned from within the Department.  Further staff will be recruited, including through the assignment of three media and communications assistants who were already in the process of recruitment to fill existing vacancies through an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>  <p>  The former GIS function will be integrated within the new structure, while the Government Press Office will continue to operate as before in dealing with day-to-day media queries, under the direction of the Government Press Secretary.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that further vacancies will be filled through advertisement for staff on secondment from within the Public Service.  As with all other positions, the possibility of open recruitment will be considered if that is considered to be the best method to obtain staff with the required skills.  These staffing decisions will be made by the Department&rsquo;s senior management.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort will be made to avoid duplication with existing functions, both within the Department of the Taoiseach and across the public service.  Indeed, one of the principal purposes of this initiative is to reduce duplication and increase whole of government co-ordination.<\/p>  <p>  As well as increasing the effectiveness and quality of communications, this will also lead to greater value for money and reduced expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in establishing the modernisation of communications, my Department conducted some research on existing communications activities, including the range of campaigns, brands and channels of communication used by different agencies, and which have built up over many years, under successive governments.  The results of that research will be used by civil service management to help frame the work plan for the new unit.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, most of the existing communication activities are an essential part of the work of state agencies, in areas such as transport, tourism, trade and investment promotion, food, energy and health.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are significant opportunities for building the effectiveness of that existing capacity, as well as for rationalisation.<\/p>  <p>  This will ensure that the new approach to strategic communications will be cost-neutral.  In fact, it is likely to give rise to a significant increase in value for money and a reduction in overall expenditure, over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[39035\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000062#WRD04900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of persons employed as policy, special and communications advisers that are not civil servants.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>One of my advisers is a public servant on secondment to my Department from Trinity College Dublin.

The credit is granted in the first instance to the primary claimant, who is the person with whom the child resides for the whole or greater part of the year, normally 183 or more days per year. This could be either the mother or the father, or in some cases another carer such as a grandparent. In cases where there is an exact 50:50 split between parents, the credit is allocated to the parent in receipt of the child benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>The primary claimant may, if he or she wishes, relinquish the credit in favour of a qualifying secondary claimant who has the child residing with him or her for not less than 100 days in the year. Where a primary claimant relinquishes his or her entitlement to the credit, the relinquishment remains in place until the primary claimant withdraws it, i.e. the secondary claimant can continue to claim the credit, provided he or she continues to satisfy the conditions for claiming the credit, until the relinquishment of the credit is withdrawn by the primary claimant.\u00a0<\/p><p>If a parent believes he or she qualifies as the primary claimant in respect of a qualifying child but the credit has been granted to another individual, he or she should provide a completed Form SPCC1 to Revenue together with any relevant evidence in support of his\/her claim that the child resides with him\/her for the whole or greater part of the year.

Consequently\u00a0the sale of any shareholding in AIB\u00a0does not count as general government revenue.  Thus\u00a0there is no increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance and compliance with the fiscal rules.<\/p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, the cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares, which have been transferred to the Exchequer, reduce the\u00a0Exchequer borrowing requirement and\u00a0result\u00a0in lower general government net debt initially and gross debt in time.  A lower level of\u00a0debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but will also result in reduced interest payments in future years.

The terms of reference for the review required that it also have regard to the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue on an ongoing basis and the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s review was informed by the outcomes of a public consultation which received 51 written submissions.<\/p>  <p>  In a contribution to the review, the Economics Division of the Department of Finance prepared estimates of the potential implications for taxpayer liabilities of price developments as a result of price increases since May 2013.  This analysis indicated a large variation across the country in possible changes to tax liabilities and estimated that<\/p>  <p>  -  48% of properties would remain in their original band and thus not generate any increase in tax liability,<\/p>  <p>  -  35% of properties would have moved by one band,<\/p>  <p>  -  10% of properties would have moved by two bands,<\/p>  <p>  -  The remainder (6%) would have moved by between three and six valuation bands<\/p>  <p>  This illustrated the hypothetical situation that if a revaluation occurred in 2015 there would be significant increases in tax liabilities for some taxpayers, with the bigger band jumps occurring for properties valued in the higher valuation bands in May 2013.  The analysis also indicated a wide degree of regional variation in band changes with the largest band increases, and as a consequence tax liability increases under current legislation, mainly occurring in the Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  Dr Thornhill&rsquo;s review report was published on Budget Day 2015.  His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have consistently stated that my Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.  I can assure the Deputy that this work will be done in good time and that the Government will be make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.  In that regard I consider it very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT i.e., achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms, will inform our consideration of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[39180\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures he is taking to help persons who are experiencing high motor insurance premiums; his views on whether these measures are seeing positive results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its report titled the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed time-frames, which are set out in an Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The second such update was published on the Department's website on 21 July 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations, with a particular focus on the 17 action points which were due for completion in the second quarter of 2017.  All 17 of these action points have been completed by this deadline.  Overall, all but one of the 27 action points due in the first two quarters of the year have been completed.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The third quarterly update will issue in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the recommended measures yielding positive results, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for August) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.

Ensuring a sustainable path for the public finances is also of fundamental importance.<\/p>  <p>  Greater market diversification must be part of the policy response, so that dependence and exposure to the UK market is reduced.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, Ireland Connected, a number of measures have been set out to specifically address Brexit related issues, including diversification of markets for indigenous exporters.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department continues to work with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, SBCI, Enterprise Ireland, and the Department of Agriculture to develop potential supports in response to the future needs of businesses impacted by Brexit.  Development of these proposed responses is subject to resources being agreed as part of the annual budgetary process.<\/p>  <p>  Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will also be particularly important in assisting viable but vulnerable SMEs that may be adversely affected due to Brexit.  These supports will help raise awareness of both private market financial supports and existing State supports. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Regulation","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[39279\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of resolving the outstanding claims associated with a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>Setanta Insurance was placed into liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority on 30 April 2014.  Setanta Insurance was a Maltese incorporated company and therefore, the Setanta liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.\u00a0 The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced.  Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, an Order was granted in the High Court on Monday 24 July 2017 in relation to 324 claims which were subsequently paid by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  The Liquidator has informed the Department that, as of 31 August 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%&euro;825,000 limits. \u00a0The Liquidator is currently working on the next batch of claims to be included in the next application to the High Court scheduled to be made in February 2018 in accordance with the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to.  In this regard, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson in 2014 who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation.\u00a0 The Liquidator has subsequently informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgment, a new actuarial report is being commissioned.\u00a0 This is expected to be completed in Q4 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[39306\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be raised if a cap\u00a0was introduced\u00a0for companies to allow for a\u00a0maximum write off of\u00a0depreciation against\u00a0income of percentages (details supplied) per annum regarding capital allowances on intellectual property.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[39307\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be raised if the 2014\u00a0rules of taxation for capital allowance of\u00a0intellectual\u00a0property were\u00a0reinstated with regard to capital allowances on intellectual property.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[39521\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised if a cap\u00a0was introduced\u00a0for companies to allow for a\u00a0maximum write off of annual depreciation of intangible assets of percentages (details supplied) of annual income.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 157 and 174 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, which was undertaken by an independent expert, Mr. Seamus Coffey, was published on Tuesday, 12 September 2017.\u00a0 In the Review, Mr. Coffey makes a number of recommendations in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax code, including a recommendation that a cap of 80% should apply to the amount of capital allowances for intangible assets, and any related interest expense, that may be deducted from income arising from intangible assets in an accounting period.\u00a0 The use of such capital allowances and related interest expenses are already ring-fenced under current legislation - they can only be offset against relevant income arising from the intangible assets.\u00a0 However, Mr. Coffey has recommended that a cap should also apply, in line with the treatment that applied prior to 2015, with the objective of ensuring some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Of note, the re-introduction of a cap would affect the timing of relief in the form of capital allowances and related interest expenses for intangible assets but would not affect the overall quantum of relief.\u00a0 This is because any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap would be available for carry forward and utilisation in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect.\u00a0 This would mean that intangible assets acquired prior to the date on which any cap is introduced in law would be &lsquo;grandfathered&rsquo; and claims made by reference to those intangible assets would not be subject to a cap.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I requested my Department and Revenue to look at the costings associated with the introduction of a cap on capital allowances for intangible assets and related interest expenses.\u00a0 However, given the complexities involved, further analysis is required to quantify the tax revenues that might be generated as a result of introducing such a cap.  Any change in law will be prospective and, therefore, any increase in tax revenues as a result of a restriction on the timing of the reliefs will depend on the scale of claims made in respect of future acquisitions of intangible assets, including any claims made as a consequence of the on-shoring of intangible assets currently held in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[39308\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on recent EU tax proposals backed by\u00a0France, Germany, Spain and Italy which would see big multinationals taxed on turnover as opposed to the current system which taxes them on profits, particularly in view of Ireland's economic\u00a0reliance on US multinationals\u00a0with their European\u00a0headquarters here.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>Ireland remains committed to global tax reform and believes that global solutions are needed to ensure tax is paid by companies where value is created.\u00a0 That is why Ireland has been a committed participant in, and strong supporter of, tax reform efforts led by the OECD through the BEPS process. \u00a0<\/p><p>The OECD is already carrying out important research into the digital economy, with the publication of its interim report expected in Spring 2018. \u00a0This will provide important input into the ongoing consideration of where value is created in digital business.<\/p><p>It would be premature to take action without considering the OECD analysis and for that reason I do not support the recent proposal to move ahead of the OECD process through the introduction of an equalisation tax based on turnover.<\/p><p>A consistent global approach is needed, as these digital companies are global in nature.

consumer borrowers.  One of the key measures is the Central Bank of Ireland macro-prudential measures which apply proportionate loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits to mortgage lending by regulated financial service providers.  For principal dwelling home mortgages, the loan-to-income limit is set at 3.5 times gross income though lenders have the flexibility to exceed that threshold each year in respect of up to 20 per cent of housing credit.  More generally the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 places an obligation on lenders to assess the creditworthiness of residential mortgage borrowers and it also provides that credit shall only be made available where the assessment indicates that the borrower is likely to be able to meet the obligations of the proposed credit agreement.  The Central Bank Consumer Protection Code also places a requirement on lenders to assess the affordability of credit, including a consideration of the personal consumer's ability to repay the mortgage on the basis of a 2 per cent increase in the mortgage rate above that offered to the borrower.  (However, this test does not apply where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more).  Subject to complying with these legislative and regulatory requirements it is a matter for lenders to set their own mortgage credit policies and to make their own individual mortgage lending decisions.  Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to provide credit, or the amount of credit to offer, in any particular case is a commercial decision for the individual lender.  As Minister for Finance, I would not have a role in such commercial decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[39454\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000065#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who on receipt of\u00a0a lump sum at retirement exceeded their tax free lump sum threshold of &euro;200,000 in each of the years 2014 to 2016 in tabular form; the number of persons who were taxed at 20%\u00a0reduced income tax and no USC on the portion of their lump sum\u00a0between &euro;200,001 and &euro;500,000; and the number of persons who were subject to full taxation on their sum on the amount in excess of &euro;500,000.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>Section 790AA of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the taxation of retirement lump sums, paid under various pension arrangements that are above the specified tax-free limit of &euro;200,000. <\/p><p>The following table sets out the total number of relevant retirement lump sum payments (i.e. greater than &euro;200,000) and the associated tax collected for the years 2014 to 2016.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research.  Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  * prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  * development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  * improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the Office of Public Works (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the OPW that the current position regarding the CFRAM Programme is that the review by the OPW of the final versions of the Flood Risk Management Plans, having taken account of the submissions received during public and statutory consultation is almost completed.

The insurance industry uses its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk to individual properties.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.

This Report recommended the setting up of a fully functioning insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud.  A dedicated Working Group has been set up in the Department of Justice and Equality to implement this recommendation.  A further recommendation which is being actively examined is aimed at exploring the potential for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance also recommended the provision of additional information to consumers by insurers on their premium breakdown.  This recommendation is being implemented by the Central Bank of Ireland who are undertaking a consultation process to determine what information should be included.  Due to their role in implementing this recommendation, my officials contacted the Central Bank on the idea of including the estimated cost of insurance fraud on each individual insurance premium and they indicated that this &ldquo;would appear to be a complex process.  Due to the nature of insurance fraud it would not be feasible to accurately estimate the exact cost of fraud and attribute it to an individual policy.  Therefore any attribution of &lsquo;fraud cost&rsquo; to an individual policy would be artificial and ultimately not of benefit to the policyholder.&rdquo;\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials also contacted Insurance Ireland in relation to your question and were informed that it has been running advertising campaigns for many years highlighting the cost of fraudulent activity and encouraging the public to reported suspected fraudulent activity through its &ldquo;Insurance Confidential&rdquo; service.  As part of an ongoing campaign which was launched last year, advertisements have highlighted the view that insurance fraud adds &euro;50 to the average motor insurance premium, with insurance fraud estimated to cost the whole industry &euro;200 million a year.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has indicated that 9,000 cases of suspected fraud have been received and investigated through its &ldquo;Insurance Confidential&rdquo; website and related lo-call phone number.  It also claims that the current high-profile campaign &ndash; run across broadcast and online outlets, including social media &ndash; has led to increases in the number of cases of fraud reported to &ldquo;Insurance Confidential&rdquo;, as well in the number of visitors to the website and an overall increased awareness of the service.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, fraud continues to be examined during the second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which is focused on employer and public liability.  \u00a0While the issues under consideration in respect of employer liability insurance and public liability insurance are particularly complex and raise a number of constitutional questions, it is hoped that a final report will be published during the autumn\/winter term.\u00a0  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver the objectives of fairer premiums and a more stable and competitive market without unnecessary delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000066#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interest Rates","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000066#WRH03000"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[39652\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000066#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action being taken to reduce variable interest rates in the banking sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>The issue of standard variable mortgage rates is a significant one for this Government and\u00a0the\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government has\u00a0set out a number of important and practical\u00a0measures\u00a0which seek\u00a0to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.<\/p><p>A key item was the request to\u00a0the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to\u00a0conduct a review of the Irish mortgage market.  The CCPC has recently\u00a0produced its\u00a0report and it outlines\u00a0a range of short, medium and long term\u00a0options to improve the operation of the market.  The Government will now evaluate and\u00a0consider these options in detail.

In particular, the Programme for a Partnership Government considers that the development of a code of conduct\u00a0for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative\u00a0which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  In line with this commitment, in 2016 the Central Bank commenced\u00a0research in the area of mortgage switching which\u00a0was completed\u00a0earlier this year.  Based on this research, the Central Bank has now commenced a consultation process on proposed measures\u00a0to help consumers to compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options and to provide consumers with standardised switching information:<\/p><p><i>www.centralbank.ie\/docs\/default-source\/publications\/Consultation-Papers\/cp112\/cp112-enhanced-mortgage-measures---transparency-and-switching.pdf?sfvrsn=2.<\/i><\/p><p>The\u00a0Central Bank has already made some changes to require lenders to better inform and protect variable rate mortgage holders\u00a0in relation to changes in mortgage rates.  These were\u00a0set out\u00a0in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012\u00a0and\u00a0require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an interest rate increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender\u00a0provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool.<\/p><p>In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.

I have been informed by the AIB Group that it adheres to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice in respect of the bank's reporting obligations.  In addition, all AIB staff are subject to a number of Bank Policies, Standards and Guidance documents in relation to safety and security of AIB customer and business information.  The Bank&rsquo;s Information Security Policy and Standards prescribe the Bank&rsquo;s standards and controls in respect of the handling and transfer of confidential and sensitive information and provides that the confidentiality of customer, staff and business information must be maintained at all times. <\/p>  <p>  AIB has informed me that all staff are required to keep documents, files and folders in a secure environment and ensure that confidential documents are not read in public view and to use electronic means of securing the data where possible.  When a staff member becomes aware of any incident where customer or employee information has potentially been compromised they must immediately report the incident to the Data Protection Team.  A Data Protection error is also logged on the Bank&rsquo;s internal Complaints &amp;amp; Error Management systems.  The Data Protection Team record all confirmed Data Protection breaches, manage all interactions with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and advise business areas on the resolution of incidents.  AIB&rsquo;s Information Security Standards For All booklet also provides guidance to staff on the handling of information in their care and provides that confidential paper must not be left unattended and or taken out of the office unless required.  AIB staff are also reminded through on-going training and awareness sessions that protecting customer information is a key part of the Information Security and Risk Awareness procedures and is fundamental to their Data Protection obligations to keep personal data safe and secure.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Bank of Ireland Group that it is committed to ensuring the privacy rights of individuals are upheld at all times and that it has policies in place to preserve the confidentiality of personal data it holds, in line with the Data Protection Commissioner's approved Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice.  The risks of accidental disclosure or loss of personal information are addressed through business controls and standards to protect such data during collection, processing, storage and transmission (transportation).<\/p>  <p>  Permanent TSB have informed me that the bank fully complies with the Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice, including reporting breaches to the Commissioner.

KBC Bank takes appropriate security measures to help prevent against unauthorised access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data and to help prevent against its accidental loss or destruction.  This includes adopting enhanced security measures where personal data is being stored or processed outside of a KBC Bank office location.<\/p>  <p>  Ulster Bank Ireland DAC has informed me that it takes its Data Protection responsibilities very seriously.

Their internal security policies set out how customer data should be managed, handled and stored.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, the Central Bank has informed me that Irish Credit Institutions are required to notify regulators of operational risk and loss events.

However, the provision of insurance cover and\u00a0the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and\u00a0is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept\u00a0and\u00a0adequate provisioning to meet those risks.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In my role as\u00a0Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I,\u00a0nor the Central Bank of\u00a0Ireland, can\u00a0interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance carried out a review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report, as approved by Government in November 2016.  As part of the review, the Department\u00a0examined a number of possible approaches including approaches in other jurisdictions.  It was considered that the approach of an\u00a0Insurance Pool with State Indemnification similar to Flood Re would\u00a0lead to additional levies being imposed on all household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and\u00a0could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the State in the form of a State backstop. <\/p>  <p>  The review recommended the continuation of the existing policy approach which has been in place since 2010, and confirmed by Government again in November 2016.  This policy is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk based approach to dealing with flooding problems, which should in turn lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.

This document details to borrowers\u00a0how their variable interest rate has been set and what factors may result in changes to their variable interest rate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition,\u00a0when\u00a0issuing an\u00a0annual statement of account on the mortgage or\u00a0when notifying the borrower of a change in their variable\u00a0mortgage interest rate, a\u00a0lender must now also provide the borrower with a summary of other available mortgage products that the lender\u00a0offers that may\u00a0provide savings for the borrower at that point in time,\u00a0details of where the borrower can obtain further information on these mortgage products, and the lender is also required to provide a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's website relating to switching lenders or changing mortgage type.<\/p>  <p>  However, within the\u00a0regulatory and legal\u00a0framework which governs\u00a0residential mortgages and private contracts more generally, the setting and adjustment of variable and other mortgage interest rates will be a contractual and commercial matter for the parties to the mortgage contract.  I\u00a0have no\u00a0role in relation to\u00a0the\u00a0detailed terms of mortgage contracts entered into\u00a0by individual lenders.  However, if a person is not happy with the way a regulated lender is dealing with their mortgage the person can invoke the complaints resolution framework of the Consumer Protection Code and which can include, if necessary, taking the case to the independent Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme Applications","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[39905\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the rebate due to a person (details supplied) under the home renovation scheme will be paid in full; and the reason for the delay in this payment.","asker":"1248","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>As regards the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI), relief is given by way of an income tax credit as distinct from a tax rebate.

For example, in Ireland we provide grant support to circa 45% of full-time undergraduate students.  By comparison, there are no needs-based grants available to students in England. Instead support to cover the costs of attending college, is provided via student loans. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department will invest almost &euro;450m in access measures to assist students from under-represented groups to participate in and complete higher education.  <\/p>  <p>  The principal support is the student grant scheme, which makes available means-tested financial assistance to students in further and higher education.  Under the terms of the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students on full-time courses who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  It is anticipated that the scheme will benefit circa 80,000 students in 2017\/18. Other key supports include the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured additional funding of &euro;36.5m for the higher education sector, as part of a &euro;160m three year funding package.  This includes &euro;8.5m for access measures, including the reintroduction of postgraduate maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged students.  This additional money will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.  Among those who will benefit from the additional third level funding being made available are students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents, and Travellers.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals to develop a more sustainable funding model for the higher education system are contained in the Cassells report that is currently being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I referred the Cassells report to the Joint Committee in order to build political consensus around the most appropriate future funding model for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently considering a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  The proposal under consideration seeks to deliver up to an additional &euro;200m per annum by 2020 through an increase in the National Training Fund levy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Risk Assessment","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[39103\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the role his Department has in co-ordinating Departments' responses to the risks outlined in the national assessment report on risks, particularly in view of the fact that they apply to the risks outlined in the report in relation to human capital and skills needs and in view of the fact they are deemed to be issues of growing importance in the report; the areas the Government will address; and the way in which it will address same.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The National Risk Assessment process was initiated in 2013 when the Government announced it would publish annually a National Risk Assessment (NRA), as a process to identify the strategic risks that Ireland faces over the short, medium and long term.  The Department of the Taoiseach co-ordinates the preparation of the NRA supported by a Steering Group of Government Departments and Agencies.  The first report was published in 2014 and the fourth most recently on 29 August 2017. The National Risk Assessment process involves several stages, including collaboration with Government Departments and Agencies, and open public consultation.  This exercise is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management that is already conducted within government departments and agencies.  Nor does it impact on the responsibilities of Government Ministers and Departments to consider and implement actions to mitigate risks arising in policy areas under their remit.  Rather, it aims to provide a systematic overview of strategic risks facing the country and to assist in ensuring appropriate prevention and mitigation measures are introduced by the relevant Departments\/Agencies as needed.<\/p>  <p>  My Department launched the National Skills Strategy 2025 in January 2016.  The Strategy identifies Ireland&rsquo;s current skills profile, provides a strategic vision and specific objectives for Ireland&rsquo;s future skills requirements, and sets out a road map for how the vision and objectives can be achieved across the education and training sector.  With over 140 Actions, the Strategy sets out the Government's commitment to improving and using skills for sustainable economic growth and outlines how we can develop a well-skilled, adaptable workforce.  Implementation of the Strategy is a cross-cutting issue , which requires the co-operation of many different stakeholders.  In addition to the responsibilities of Government Departments and agencies, employers and individuals also have their own parts to play in the implementation of the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Included in the actions in the Strategy is the creation of a new National Skills Council.  The Council, which was established in April 2017, will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of responses to identified skills needs.  Skills information from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in DBEI (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in Solas (SLMRU) and the Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[39592\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the school transport of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p><p>During the 2016\/17 school year almost 116,000 children, including some 12,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that a service will be extended to accommodate the child in question this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Data","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[39864\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000067#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the names of all persons who served as chairperson and ordinary members of F&Aacute;S from 2012 until its dissolution; the amount of remuneration, travel and subsistence paid to each person from 2012 until its dissolution; if persons who are public servants received remuneration in breach of the one person one salary rule; if he plans to recover such payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>Details of all persons who served as chairperson and ordinary members of the Board of F&Aacute;S during 2012 and 2013 including remuneration and travel and subsistence paid in respect of attendance at Board meetings are attached.

In terms of collaborative links the UK is our largest collaborator under Horizon 2020.

The Fire Officers have broadly welcomed the Department&rsquo;s proactive approach to dealing with the issues highlighted and have indicated their acceptance of the course of action being followed by the Department, including the identified remediation works and the fact that the schools continue to be occupied on a day-to-day basis. <\/p>  <p>  The background to the Fire Safety Reports has been outlined in the Press Statement on 1 September with the publication of the report. In October 2015, following the issues that arose in respect of Rush\/Lusk ETNS, the Department made arrangements for the procurement of fire safety inspections of the five schools constructed in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  A Consultant was appointed to carry out the fire inspection audits of the schools. The initial fire safety investigations were carried out in January 2016. Draft Fire Reports were prepared in March 2016. In order to complete the reports it was necessary for the Fire Consultant to gather further information on the buildings including compliance reports, drawings etc. and to conduct further investigations and site visits. The Final Reports were received in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Department met with WBS and their Architectural Consultant in June 2016. It was agreed at the meeting that WBS would liaise with the Departments Consultant&rsquo;s and would carry out the required works in the relevant schools. <\/p>  <p>  In August 2016 WBS advised that the priority works (i.e. immediate essential improvement works) had been carried out at the schools. Despite a number of requests by the Department, photographic reports and commentary on the works were sought following the works in August but information was not received until late September and early October 2016. The Department&rsquo;s Consultant issued a commentary on the information to WBS on 25th November 2016 expressing concerns.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2017 the Department&rsquo;s Project Managers advised WBS that following their reports in relation to the remedial works at the schools, commentary received from the Fire Consultant had suggested that the reports provided did not address the original Fire Consultant reports in their entirety. They were requested to provide reference photographs for each item deemed to be attended to and for any items not yet completed to include a reason for not addressing and a proposed date for attending to same. <\/p>  <p>  Further site visits to the schools were carried out by the Fire Consultant in March\/April 2017. This was a visual inspection of the previously advised completed items by the Fire Consultant. The Draft Report which was received from the Fire Consultant in May 2017 following this visit concluded that very little upgrade works which were previously advised had actually been carried out. Where works were carried out they were not to a satisfactory standard and there were issues identified within the Fire Consultant&rsquo;s report of July 2016 which had not been addressed. <\/p>  <p>  While it had been the Department&rsquo;s understanding that WBS had carried out the works in summer 2016 which had been highlighted in the Fire Consultant reports as being most urgent and important, it became apparent following review by the Fire Consultant that this was not in fact the case. <\/p>  <p>  On 5 May 2017 the Department met with WBS to discuss the findings of the reports of May 2017. WBS committed to visiting the schools in week commencing 8th May to review.  <\/p>  <p>  Since that date the progress in respect of the schools in question is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  On 12th May 2017, the Department and its Consultants along with Consultants representing WBS met with the relevant Fire Officer, to discuss the schools. Copies of the Fire consultant reports were provided. The Fire Officer was advised of the project to build larger permanent schools to replace the temporary schools by the end of 2018. <\/p>  <p>A detailed proposal on works proposed and conformity on the compartmentation of the building was submitted to the Fire Officer by Western Building Systems Fire Safety Consultant   on 8th August. <\/p>  <p>Remediation works on the Fire Doors commenced on Tuesday 29th August. WBS has confirmed that the remedial works to all fire doors in both schools was completed by Wednesday 30th   August. <\/p>  <p>  WBS further advised the Department that the enhancements to the fire stopping and the remedial work required to the fire collar fixings as well as the intumescent paint works would be carried out as weekend works in September. <\/p>  <p>  The current position is that works have now been completed and arrangements are being made for the works to be inspected jointly by the Department&rsquo;s and WBS Consultants and a report will be submitted to the Fire Officer. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the schools new permanent accommodation, the building project for this is at tender stage.  The tender assessment report has been received in the Department and is currently under review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gaelscoil Issues","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[39241\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department carried out a study on the establishment of a support centre within his Department to enable the transition of English medium schools to Irish medium schools; if he will provide the results of such a study; if there is an established protocol within his Department for such a procedure; if he will make these guidelines available if such a protocol exists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>My Department has no proposals to carry out a study in relation to the establishment of a support centre for Irish language medium education at this time.

the actions taken; when they were taken to deal with these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>On 1 September my Department published fire safety reports for five school buildings constructed in 2008, including the school in question, where issues had been identified in respect of the compliance with their fire safety certificates. <\/p>  <p>  These Fire safety reports were completed in July 2016. The findings of the reports indicated issues of insufficient compliance with some requirements of the fire safety certificates in relation to fire retardation in those buildings. The reports found that while the designs which underpinned the Fire Safety Certificates required that the buildings would provide 60 minutes of retardation to facilitate evacuation, the actual quality of construction indicated a level of retardation less than this. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is not a finding that the buildings are dangerous, it is a finding that the buildings do not comply with the detailed requirements of the Fire Safety Certificates. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that in the case of each of the schools, the Department has engaged extensively with the Fire Officers of the relevant Local Authorities. The Fire Officers have broadly welcomed the Department&rsquo;s proactive approach to dealing with the issues highlighted and have indicated their acceptance of the course of action being followed by the Department, including the identified remediation works and the fact that the schools continue to be occupied on a day-to-day basis. <\/p>  <p>  The background to the Fire Safety Reports has been outlined in the Press Statement on 1 September with the publication of the report. In October 2015, following the issues that arose in respect of Rush\/Lusk ETNS, the Department made arrangements for the procurement of fire safety inspections of the five schools constructed in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  A Consultant was appointed to carry out the fire inspection audits of the schools. The initial fire safety investigations were carried out in January 2016. Draft Fire Reports were prepared in March 2016. In order to complete the reports it was necessary for the Fire Consultant to gather further information on the buildings including compliance reports, drawings etc. and to conduct further investigations and site visits. The Final Reports were received in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Department met with WBS and their Architectural Consultant in June 2016. It was agreed at the meeting that WBS would liaise with the Departments Consultant&rsquo;s and would carry out the required works in the relevant schools. <\/p>  <p>  In August 2016 WBS advised that the priority works (i.e. immediate essential improvement works) had been carried out at the schools. Despite a number of requests by the Department, photographic reports and commentary on the works were sought following the works in August but information was not received until late September and early October 2016. The Department&rsquo;s Consultant issued a commentary on the information to WBS on 25th November 2016 expressing concerns.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2017 the Department&rsquo;s Project Managers advised WBS that following their reports in relation to the remedial works at the schools, commentary received from the Fire Consultant had suggested that the reports provided did not address the original Fire Consultant reports in their entirety. They were requested to provide reference photographs for each item deemed to be attended to and for any items not yet completed to include a reason for not addressing and a proposed date for attending to same. <\/p>  <p>  Further site visits to the schools were carried out by the Fire Consultant in March\/April 2017. This was a visual inspection of the previously advised completed items by the Fire Consultant. The Draft Report which was received from the Fire Consultant in May 2017 following this visit concluded that very little upgrade works which were previously advised had actually been carried out. Where works were carried out they were not to a satisfactory standard and there were issues identified within the Fire Consultant&rsquo;s report of July 2016 which had not been addressed. <\/p>  <p>  While it had been the Department&rsquo;s understanding that WBS had carried out the works in summer 2016 which had been highlighted in the Fire Consultant reports as being most urgent and important, it became apparent following review by the Fire Consultant that this was not in fact the case. <\/p>  <p>  On 5 May 2017 the Department met with WBS to discuss the findings of the reports of May 2017. WBS committed to visiting the schools in week commencing 8th May to review.  Since that date the progress in respect of the school in question is as follows.<\/p>  <p>A meeting was also held with the Fire Officer on 23rd June 2017 to discuss this school. A further meeting was held with the Fire Officer for Monday 4th   September to provide an update on the programme of works proposed. The works to be carried out include fire-stopping upgrades, intumescent paint\/steel protection, and plasterboard partitions, emergency lighting, fire door upgrades and renewing cavity barriers. <\/p>  <p>  The Fire Consultant has agreed the final scope of works with the Contractor. The Department intends to commence each element of work as soon as possible. It is anticipated that all works should be completed by the end of October. <\/p>  <p>  On completion of the works these will be inspected by the Department and a full report will be submitted to the Fire Officer.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also been in communication with the Patron Body and the school authority and has updated them on progress. In addition a further meeting has been sought with the Fire Officer which will be attended by representatives of the School Authority and my Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Assistance Fund","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[39328\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000068#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the tax relief or financial support available to a person (details supplied) going back to college for a four-year course.","asker":"1248","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>The principal support provided by my Department, is the student grant scheme.

This approach, building on the work done by my predecessor, has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position.  As the negotiations enter an important phase over the coming weeks and months, continuing such engagement with EU partners, both at political and official level, will remain a key priority.<\/p>  <p>  On Monday 4 September, I met with Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator on Brexit, and his team.  This was our second meeting since my appointment.  It was a constructive meeting in which we discussed the evolution of the negotiations.  I welcomed the progress that has been made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and a range of technical separation issues.  However, it is clear that there are still many issues outstanding, not least on the issue of the financial settlement, and much work is still required ahead of any decision by the European Council on whether sufficient progress has been made.   <\/p>  <p>  We also discussed the Irish specific issues, which are one of the three priority issues for phase one of the negotiations.  While some progress is being made on these issues, most notably with regard to the Common Travel Area, much work is still required on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including sustaining North South cooperation and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  The Government supports the Task Force&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland which reflects our priorities and sets out important principles that should form the basis of future solutions on the Irish specific issues as part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Brussels earlier this month I also met with MEPs from across the political spectrum within the European Parliament, including with Guy Verhofstadt, the Parliament's Coordinator on Brexit, and with Irish MEPs.  This provided a valuable opportunity to engage with them at the beginning of a new parliamentary term and to update them on Ireland&rsquo;s perspective on the negotiations.  I am glad that Guy Verhofstadt will be visiting Ireland later this week, as it is a further indication of the priority afforded by the European Parliament to Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns within the context of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  Since my appointment, I have also held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues, including my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts.  I also welcomed the Finnish Foreign Minister to Ireland in July.  Earlier this month I had short meetings with my counterparts from Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Slovenia, as well as the Cypriot Minister for Defence, at the Gymnich\/Informal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  My officials also continue to meet their counterparts in other Member States, and of course the Permanent Representation in Brussels is also key to this work.<\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with EU partners to date, I have laid particular emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s objective of protecting the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I have strongly emphasised the need for an imaginative and flexible political solution.  In so doing, I have been equally clear that we will only pursue solutions that are compatible with our aim of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  I will continue to deliver this message in my engagements in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000070#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000070#WRM02500"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[39094\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000070#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he or his Department are making plans to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>Planning is underway in my Department to mark the 20<sup>th<\/sup>anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, on 10<sup>th<\/sup>April next year.

The Taskforce is acting on the basis of the mandate approved by the EU27 Member States at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 22 May and in accordance with the EU&rsquo;s overall approach to the negotiations as agreed in the European Council Guidelines of 29 April.  The negotiations, which formally commenced on 19 June, are taking place on the basis of four-week negotiating cycles.  Three rounds have taken place to date, with the fourth round set to commence on 25 September.  In accordance with the European Council Guidelines and the Terms of Reference agreed between the EU and the UK, the negotiations are focusing on withdrawal issues during phase 1 (citizens' rights, financial settlement, Irish specific issues and &ldquo;separation&rdquo; issues which are of a more technical character) with the commencement of phase 2 (parallel discussions on future relationship issues) contingent on sufficient progress having being made on phase 1 issues.<\/p>  <p>  Three Negotiating Groups have been established at technical level to advance negotiations on citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the other &ldquo;separation&rdquo; issues.  In recognition of their complexity and sensitivity, it was agreed that resolving the Irish set of issues should be taken forward by the most senior officials within the negotiating teams by way of a High Level Dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  The EU27 Member States are monitoring progress and giving guidance to the Taskforce through a dedicated Article 50 Working Party, which in turn reports to Coreper (Art. 50), on which Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the European Union sits.  This is ensuring that the negotiations are carried out under the overall strategic and political guidance of the EU27 Member States through the European Council (Art. 50) and the General Affairs Council (Art. 50), supported by a very high level of scrutiny at senior official and Ambassadorial levels.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has the lead responsibility for coordinating a whole-of-Government approach to the negotiations and we are working actively with all Government Departments to this end, in particular in relation to the Irish-specific issues in the current phase of negotiations that require a cross-departmental approach such as the Common Travel Area and protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the avoidance of a hard border.<\/p>  <p>  Both I and my officials are also working very closely with Mr Barnier and his team to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s positions are understood and reflected in the Taskforce&rsquo;s approach to each round of the negotiations and of course the Permanent Representation in Brussels is also central to this work.  Our intensive engagement with our counterparts from other Member States is also continuing at both political and official level. <\/p>  <p>  On the Irish specific issues, I am satisfied with the direction the High Level Dialogue between the UK and EU teams is taking.  Good progress has been made on the Common Travel Area and there is a common objective to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.  However, while some progress is being made on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the avoidance of a hard border, a lot more work is required on ensuring that the full implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU is understood, including on North South cooperation.  <\/p>  <p>  In the last round of negotiations which concluded on 31 August, the UK presented its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  While the publication of this paper was welcome, the UK&rsquo;s aspirations and statements of principle need to be backed by substantive commitments and clear links to workable solutions. <\/p>  <p>  The Government welcomes and supports the Taskforce&rsquo;s paper on the &ldquo;Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland&rdquo; of 7 September.  The paper builds on the European Council Guidelines agreed earlier this year and reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government: protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the peace process, including avoiding a hard border, and maintaining the Common Travel Area and sets out the principles on which solutions will have to be based.  The EU will now seek to agree these principles with the UK as the basis for the future discussions on detailed solutions.

Consequently, it is not yet possible for a person with an existing Foreign Birth Registration Certificate to obtain a <i>new<\/i>Foreign Birth Registration Certificate in their <i>new<\/i>gender.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is making preparations for the register to go live once the Statutory Instrument is in place, which we expect in the coming months.  A gender recognition certificate will be required in order to obtain a new Foreign Birth Registration Certificate reflecting a change in gender.  However, this does not prevent a person from obtaining a passport in their new gender subject to the requirements of the Passports Act 2008 as amended (the Act).  The Act makes provision for the policies and procedures which the Passport Service adopts in relation to the issuance of a passport.  Section 11 of the Act provides for the issuing of a passport in a new gender and, if applicable, new name to applicants producing a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) issued by the Minister for Social Protection.  With regard to current passport holders, the Passport Service may issue a passport in the new gender and new name on receipt of a completed passport application, current passport and GRC.  In such circumstances, a new Foreign Birth Registration Certificate is not required.<\/p><p>My Department will have sole responsibility for the management of the new register for the gender recognition of foreign births.

In a wide-ranging speech President Juncker touched on multiple issues on the EU agenda including Climate Change, Trade, Industrial Policy, Migration, the Single Market, the Digital Agenda, the Eurozone, the Schengen Area, Defence and Taxation. <\/p><p>I welcome the positive tone of the speech echoing the Bratislava Declaration of the 27 Heads of State and Government of September last year which acknowledged that while the EU is not perfect, it remains indispensable for its members. <\/p><p>In March this year the European Commission published a White Paper on the Future of the EU.  The purpose of the White Paper is to open a wide-ranging debate with citizens, setting out five scenarios for how Europe could evolve by 2025.  These five scenarios are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive and in putting them forward the Commission is aiming to move the debate beyond a binary choice between more Europe or less Europe.

Each Paper contains different levels of ambition which broadly reflect the scenarios set out in the White Paper.

The speech echoes our broad approach to the debate with our commitment to completing the single market, completing the banking union and opening up new markets around the globe.

As the Deputy is aware, Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a European Common Defence is prohibited by article 29.4.9 of the Constitution of Ireland.  This protection is reinforced by the Irish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty.  Any change in that position could take place only with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.<\/p><p>In his address the President also asked Member States to look at which foreign policy decisions could be moved from unanimity to qualified majority voting.  As he made clear, the Treaty already provides for this, if all Member States agree to it.

Given that these issues are of crucial importance to Ireland and our economy, the Government wants to see phase two to begin as soon as possible.

Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right.  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and the Government recently published a new National Disability Inclusion Strategy (2017 &ndash; 2021).  This strategy contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences Data","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03400"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[39112\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 384 and 400 of 13 July 2017, if he will contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and request the furnishing of the information without further delay (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>I have requested another update from the Garda authorities in relation to the matters raised and I will contact the Deputy directly when this information is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[39116\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000071#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a decision will be made on the reopening of Rush Garda station with regard to the pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter.

There are no current plans to revise the legislation or the vetting process in relation to substitute teaching positions.<\/p>  <p>  Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform that Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.

The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.<\/p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced, with different criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.  The list of privileges additional to core privileges varies between prisons, and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that a tiered incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of maintaining good order, and in motivating prisoners to engage in constructive activities.  Since the introduction of the Incentivised Regimes Programme, the Irish Prison Service has witnessed a considerable reduction in assaults in prisons.  Incentivised Regimes is part of a multifaceted approach to improving outcomes for prisoners by promoting the benefits of active participation in their own rehabilitation and behavioural reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to working to ensure the continuing integrity of the Incentivised Regimes Policy and is currently finalising arrangements for the conducting of a review.<\/p>  <p>  It is not intended to tender for an external review of the Incentivised Regimes Programme at this time.

Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  <\/p>  <p>  The law places an emphasis on recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her parents.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.

This provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted custody of or access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such custody or access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.

The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas. However the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption. <\/p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children.  Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months.  This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than three months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child.  In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.  It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Furthermore, when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified, the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>I am further informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork City Division on the 31 July 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 657 with 45 Garda Reserves and 63 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 25 of whom have been assigned to the Cork City Division.  I am also informed that a further 200 recruits will attest this coming Friday with another 200 scheduled to attest in December which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Section 17 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 provides that, as part of the annual report of the OMC, details of contracts entered into by the company must be given to members and the OMC must hold a meeting at least once a year to consider the report.

Amongst the key areas to be addressed in this context are:<\/p><p>- Further development of multidisciplinary primary care teamworking;<\/p><p>- Planning and resourcing the primary care workforce;<\/p><p>- Promoting the provision of necessary infrastructural capacity; <\/p><p>- Development of chronic disease management in primary care; and<\/p><p>- Negotiation of a modernised GP contract.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware significant funding has been invested in the development of Primary Care Centres in recent years; 104 Primary Care Centres are now operational.  In addition to the 5 already opened in 2017, a further 10 are expected to open in 2017, and another 13 are expected to open in 2018 with many more either under construction or at advanced or early planning stage.<\/p><p>The development of Primary Care Centres to accommodate Primary Care Teams and, where possible, GPs  in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services.  Primary Care Centres facilitate the shift from acute care towards primary care because of the range of multi-disciplinary services they can provide and the role they can play in keeping people who don't need to be in an acute setting out of hospital.  <\/p><p>It is the Government's intention to continue to invest in and expand capacity in the primary care sector, including the remit of services delivered in Primary Care Centres, so that we can keep people well and minimise, as far as possible, the number of patients admitted to hospitals.  This requires a focus on health promotion, prevention, early identification and simple and early interventions rather than dealing with episodes as they occur.  Primary Care Centres can and are enabling such a focus to be delivered through a range of measures including:<\/p><p>- Multi-disciplinary Primary Care Teams being located in Primary Care Centres providing a range of services such as General Practitioner Service, Practice Nurse Service, Community Nurse Service, Home Help\/Home Care Attendant Service, Occupational Therapy Service, Physiotherapy Service, Speech and Language Therapy Service and Social Work Service;<\/p><p>- Provision of diagnostic facilities in Primary Care Centres;<\/p><p>- Utilisation of space within Primary Care Centres for health promotion\/prevention activities.<\/p><p>Officials in my Department continue to review and examine the role of Primary Care Centres to ensure that we are harnessing and maximising the potential of Primary Care Centres to meet patients' health needs in local communities and reduce the need for attendance at hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000074#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000074#WRQ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[39056\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000074#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to keep older and newly qualified general practitioners here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.

These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled.  The Government is committed to further increasing this number in future years. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.

The completed HRB evidence review was published in March of this year on both the Department of Health&rsquo;s and the HRB's websites. <\/p>  <p>  This evidence review examines the public funding mechanisms for AHR in different countries.  The review looks at the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.  The review does not indicate a recommendation or preference for a specific funding model or for eligibility criteria for accessing funding; rather it outlines the pros and cons of such funding models, the different aspects of models in different jurisdictions, as well as the different rationales underpinning such funding models. <\/p>  <p>  An analysis of the HRB evidence review will feed into the development of policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment.  It should be noted that any funding model that might ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework relating to AHR.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the General Scheme of an AHR Bill is well advanced in my Department and this comprehensive piece of legislation will encompass the regulation of a range of practices, including pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.<\/p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work.<\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our older population are protected, that they get the care that they deserve, and that they have access to all of the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision, especially at such a vulnerable stage in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000075#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000075#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[39186\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000075#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) can be given a date to have open heart surgery performed in St James's Hospital.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. <\/p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow. Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources. This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services. Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies. The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 die from the disease. All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. <\/p><p>The HSE is committed to providing accurate information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether to give consent to vaccination.  All the information provided to parents about vaccination is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) so that it can be understood by all adults. The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) Guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015) developed in partnership with NALA states that &ldquo;One in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions&rdquo;.  Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) is replaced by this information leaflet and like other countries the HSE information leaflet provides the same information on side effects of the vaccine.<\/p><p>Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on all the known side effects that can occur after each vaccination.  All the known side effects of the HPV vaccine Gardasil are outlined in the information booklet given to parents.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p><p>Parents are not being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.  The HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the website where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the SPC and the PIL for each vaccine can be found.  <\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services. The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group. As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. <\/p><p>It is important that people receive accurate information from reliable sources in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website. <\/p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  <\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:<\/p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localised or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);<\/p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;<\/p><p>- For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.<\/p><p>As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000076#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications Data","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000076#WRS02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[39376\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000076#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1199 of 11 September 2017, the number of new medical card applications awaiting processing by CHO area or county; and the number of these applications that have exceeded the 15 day turnaround by CHO area or county.","asker":"1330","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Last year alone there was a 4% increase in inpatient and daycase activity over 2015, and in 2016 1.69 million patients received inpatient or daycase treatment in our hospitals, an increase of almost 40,000 on the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that, in order to improve efficiency in our hospital system, over the last number of years there has been a greater emphasis on increasing the number of procedures, previously carried out as inpatient procedures, which are now carried out on a daycase basis.  Consequently, when comparing hospital elective activity for 2012 with 2016, it can be seen that, while inpatient elective discharges decreased, daycase discharges have increased. <\/p>  <p>  In fact, taken together, elective inpatient discharges and daycase discharges increased from 1.02m in 2012 to 1.15m in 2016. HSE data for 2016 show that while elective inpatient discharges had reduced by 3.5% in comparison with the same period in 2015, daycase discharges increased by 3.1%. It is important to remember that this is the context of ever-growing demand with increased attendances at EDs, including by older persons.<\/p>  <p>  Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of exceptional reasons including cancellations because a bed or the clinical team are not available, cancellations by the patient or because the patient may not be fit for surgery at the time. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining scheduled care access for all patients and managing emergency demand at times is challenging, however all efforts are made to limit cancellations particularly for clinically urgent procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Based on data provided by the NTPF, collated from reports by hospitals, approximately 3,400 elective procedures, on average, are cancelled per month. In 2016, typically in a month, there were approximately 53,000 admissions to acute hospitals on a daycase and an inpatient basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that hospitals continue to improve how they manage, and balance, the demand for emergency care with the planning of elective procedures, to minimise the impact on patients.

Separately to these preparations for Brexit, the HPRA has commenced a project on managing medicines shortages which will help to support the availability of medicines after Brexit, but in the first instance the HPRA will seek to maintain existing authorisations on the Irish market regardless of their source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000080#WRW07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Drugs Availability","counter":1395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000081#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1396,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[39893\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000081#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reasoning behind the decision to remove a pain relief medication (details supplied) from the medical card scheme; if he will reconsider this decision in view of the effectiveness of this product for chronic pain sufferers and the high price of the medication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1397,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the overall health of Irish patients.  Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines, is a key objective of the Irish health service.  However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness, Drugs Payment as well as the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; including fees and ingredient costs, is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017.  To ensure that patients receive the highest quality care, it is essential that these resources invested in medicines are used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, to deliver greater efficiencies across the supply chain and also to promote the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>In 2013, the HSE established the Medicines Management Programme (MMP).  It is headed by the (NMIC) and the (NCPE) in collaboration with the (HSE-PCRS) and provides sustained national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.<\/p><p>The Medicines Management Programme has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing evidence-based and cost-effective prescribing nationally and the review of Versatis is an example of this.  <\/p><p>Versatis 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.<\/p><p>Following a review by the MMP of the evidence available to support the use of Versatis, the HSE has introduced a new system for the reimbursement of Versatis from 1 September 2017.  This process will support the appropriate use of this medication while ensuring those with an indication of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) continue to have access to this treatment.  <\/p><p>The product has been reimbursed under the community drugs schemes in Ireland since 2010.  Initially, the projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication.  However, total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, due primarily to off-licence use i.e. prescribing Versatis as a general treatment for pain not associated with shingles.  Currently, there are over 25,000 patients in receipt of this item.  The MMP prescribing and cost guidance report highlighted that the clinical evidence to support the use of Versatis 5% medicated plaster for PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  <\/p><p>The NCPE estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of the prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>All patients who currently receive antivirals for shingles, or patients who are prescribed antivirals for the treatment of shingles by their GP in the future, will automatically be approved for Versatis for a period of three months.  No action is required by the GP in this instance and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy will be notified in real time of the patient&rsquo;s approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who are currently initiated on Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for a period of three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.<\/p><p>From 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer be dispensed Versatis under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced patient information leaflets and advised GPs on treatment alternatives.  <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be dispensed for unlicensed indications.  In such circumstance, the GP will be required to make an application for reimbursement for unlicensed indications for new and existing patients through the online system.  <\/p><p>Where the application is under exceptional circumstances, the application will be reviewed by the MMP before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.  <\/p><p>Full details of the review of Versatis are available on the HSE website at<\/p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments.

As Minister, I do not have a statutory function in respect of such matters. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  However, the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive particularly with the move to digital transactions.  This involves harnessing existing strengths\u00a0such as its trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with individual communities to build the network of the future.  The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post&rsquo;s mandate.  The Government is fully committed to\u00a0a sustainable\u00a0post office network which it sees as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, based on overseas models, which could potentially be delivered, inter alia, through the post office network.  This issue is being dealt with by officials in the Department of Community and Rural Development who have been working actively with the Department of Finance over the last number of months to progress these commitments.  A public consultation process, seeking views on the community banking model, was launched in early March and ran for four weeks.  Officials from both of those Departments also met with the Sparkassen Foundation for International Co-operation in relation to the German Sparkassen model, in particular, and obtained detailed information from that organisation.  The Department of Community and Rural Development is currently finalising a report on the merits of establishing a local public banking model in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network,\u00a0which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing is nearing completion.  All opportunities are being assessed by An Post in the context of the current strategic review.  The recommendations of the Post Office Hub Working Group, which includes the community banking proposal, will continue to be progressed between\u00a0my Department\u00a0and the Department of Community and Rural Development.  Naturally, the outcome of the review will impact on the extent to which the recommendations contained in the various reports on the network\u00a0can be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Until such time as the review is finalised and assessed it will not be possible to comment on the level of funding that may be required.

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers (including river sections and estuaries) has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as\u00a0juveniles and returns to the same river as mature salmon to spawn and propagate the next generation of salmon distinctive to that river.<\/p>  <p>  In 2006, the Government affirmed its commitment to manage the wild salmon fishery in line with the scientific advice in the interests of conservation of stocks.  Since 2007, the harvest of salmon, by commercial fishing and recreational angling, has been restricted to those rivers that are meeting their individual conservation limits for wild salmon.  Each river has an individual conservation limit (CL) which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population. <\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by an independent Standing Scientific Committee\u00a0(SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations. Assessing the status of\u00a0stock involves the challenges of counting live aquatic animals in a dynamic fluvial\u00a0environment.  Scientific and management assessments of stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in an extensive stock monitoring programme which feeds into the scientific committee's annual reviews.  In this way, fluctuations in individual stocks are discernible on an annual basis. <\/p>  <p>  In assessing the status of salmon stocks for any particular river, the scientific committee draws on a number of data sets.  The primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch (if any).  Data from fish counters and the results from catchment wide electro-fishing are also used.<\/p>  <p>  Robust annual estimates are based on an average of the data\u00a0over the most recent five years. The use of a five year average ensures that a \"good\" or \"bad\" year in terms of salmon returns does not disproportionately impact assessments.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If the estimate of returning salmon is above the individual conservation limit then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line.  Recommendations as to the status of each river are published and, following a 30 day public consultation, the future catch options associated with each individual river\/estuary for the following fishing season is set.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0salmon assessment and management methodologies used in Ireland are considered best practice internationally and within the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO), with many other countries moving towards the development of similar models for salmon stock conservation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000082#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Waterways Maintenance","counter":1482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000082#WRY02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1483,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[39601\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000082#WRY02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will expedite permanent work to be carried out on a specific project (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1278","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1484,"content":"<p>Cork County Council is the authority responsible for carrying out works to the weir and for the funding of same.

This could have a transformative effect on active travel in our cities over\u00a0the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  Over recent years my Department has directly funded active travel measures (i.e. walking and cycling) throughout Ireland as part of overall expenditure under a number of programmes, including the Smarter Travel Areas, Active Travel Towns and the National Cycle Network programmes.

These cannot be made simply on the basis that they are convenient.

On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has examined the possibility of an exchange relationship for US licences.  However, as driver licensing within the US operates at state rather than federal level, there are 50 different systems, with sometimes widely varying standards.

In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, which was additional to a similar 35% increase in Budget 2016.  These increases reflect the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.<\/p>  <p>  On 11th April 2017 I made an announcement that the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) would not commence this September but that a range of measures would be introduced in September by my Department to make childcare more affordable for thousands of families throughout Ireland.  This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  As part of these 'September measures', a new universal subsidy is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they qualify for ECCE if later than 36 months) in registered childcare.  This amounts to up to &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  The &lsquo;September measures&rsquo; relate to the introduction of the Community Childcare Subvention Universal (CCSU) payment and the increase in band rates across the different strands of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Scheme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I also announced additional funding totalling &euro;3.5 million for 'non-contact time'.  This funding recognises the role played by childcare practitioners in supporting the administration of the measures that have commenced in September to lower the cost of childcare for families in Ireland.  There is a commitment to pay this additional &euro;3.5 million between September and the end of this year.  This is on top of the payment currently available for drawdown by services on foot of Budget 2017, where &euro;14.5 million was secured towards 'non-contact time'.  The majority of services have now been paid an average of over &euro;2,000 under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware of the pressures on the sector with regard to availability of places and my Department has provided &euro;8.4 million for its 2017 Early Years Capital funding programme.  This represents a doubling of the &euro;4 million provided under the 2016 Early Years Capital Funding Programme.  In addition to this, my Department has also provided &euro;4 million for its 2017 School Age Childcare Capital programme.  This funding has been made available under three strands, and it is designed to create an additional 5,000 places. <\/p>  <p>  Although my Department  has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past two budgets, as outlined above, I do acknowledge that much more must be done if we are truly to have affordable, accessible, quality childcare and continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare.  To this end I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the childcare sector in Budget 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Childcare Subvention Programme ","counter":1685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1686,"qnumday":645,"qnumall":"[39126\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated by her Department to the childcare subvention scheme in 2016.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1687,"content":"<p>The allocation for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme in 2016 was &euro;61 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme Expenditure","counter":1688,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1689,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[39127\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000085#WRBB04600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated to each band of the new affordable child care scheme for 2017; and the number of children included in each band.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1690,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the expanded community childcare scheme.

The BTEA scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment.  BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseeker's or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment or another qualifying BTEA payment will continue to receive income support under BTEA and that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.  <\/p>  <p>  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.

Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.

This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  While the telephone allowance was of assistance to those who qualified for it, the nature of the market has been transformed in recent years with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.

This is to detect and\/or prevent duplicate registrations.<\/p><p>Accordingly, SAFE Level 2 registration allows a person to verify their identity once for public service purposes because it is to a substantial level of assurance.  Consequently, it eliminates the need for a person to repeatedly register their identity information when accessing public services.  It makes it more difficult for someone else to claim to be a person and so helps to eliminate &ldquo;identity theft&rdquo; and fraudulent access to someone else&rsquo;s data.  It also facilitates the provision of high-value and personalised public services online &ndash; in a way that isn&rsquo;t possible without robust identity verification.<\/p><p>My Department has been implementing SAFE 2 identity verification on a phased basis since 2011.  More recently, other public service bodies have begun implementing it for their services.

That Strategy is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s dedicated website at <i><\/i><\/p><p>While the face-to-face meeting mentioned above is the usual method of SAFE 2 registering a person, the Department does operate other processes where possible.  In line with SAFE principles to build on already existing infrastructure (and subject to appropriate risk analysis, legally based data sharing and the consent of the individual), upgrading existing customers to SAFE Level 2 is undertaken as much as possible using relevant data already held by the State (e.g. Driver&rsquo;s License, Passport Office, All-Ireland Free Travel Scheme) combined with a number of other items and processes.  Examples of this include some pensioners who have had a passport photograph verified in a face-to-face interaction at passport application and some Free Travel clients who personally collect their primary Social Welfare payments at a Post Office not needing to attend a Department office for a face-to-face interview but instead providing by post whatever other information is required to register them to SAFE 2.  <\/p><p>In addition, and specifically with regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question,  certain persons who have renewed their Driver&rsquo;s Licence since March 2014 and in doing so have provided the Road Safety Authority with personal identity information and a photograph are also being offered the opportunity to complete the SAFE 2 registration process without attending a Department office.

In particular, the national network of Intreo centres is now available to people with disabilities who wish to engage, on a voluntary basis, with a case officer to develop a personal progression plan to assist them in exploring their employment goals.  The programme also identifies the Comprehensive Employment Strategy as a key objective in securing better outcomes for persons with disabilities and in particular the issue of ensuring that &ldquo;work always pays more than welfare&rdquo;.  In this regard, the &ldquo;Make Work Pay&rdquo; Report (MWP), designed to help people with disabilities overcome barriers to finding work, was published in April last.  The report made 24 recommendations.  A number of actions relevant to my Department have already been implemented including; people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years; a &ldquo;fast&ndash;track&rdquo; reinstatement of Disability Allowance, or Invalidity Pension for people where employment does not work out; and development is underway on a new &ldquo;ready reckoner&rdquo;, to calculate the net benefits and financial implications of working.<\/p>  <p>  Amending legislation dispensing with requirement that work must be of a rehabilitative nature is included in Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  There is a considerable administrative burden attached to this process and therefore the proposed changes, in addition to refocussing on a person&rsquo;s capacity and avoiding any misunderstanding around the rehabilitative nature of work, will result in a reduction in the administrative burden on doctors and on the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following my commitment at the launch of the report my Department has engaged on a wider consultation process with disability sectoral groups, people with disabilities and parents of people with disabilities, on recommendations 9 and 10 of the MWP report relating to early interventions.  This consultation process demonstrates my commitment to ensuring that people with disabilities have an opportunity to input into this important policy area.<\/p>  <p>  Other areas where there is progress include: an evaluation of the EmployAbility service completed in 2016 followed by the establishment of a working group to commence implementation of the operational recommendations contained in the report; increases of &euro;5 per week in the maximum rate of weekly social welfare payments from March 2017; and promoting employment supports available to people with disabilities at the Department&rsquo;s Annual Jobs Fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000088#WREE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Widow's Pension Eligibility","counter":1883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000088#WREE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1884,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[39707\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000088#WREE03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the eligibility for widower's pension in the case of a person (details supplied); if her Department will accept a certified copy of a marriage certificate as evidence of preceding divorce with particular reference to the fact that a certified copy of same was accepted by authorities in Northern Ireland to proceed with a second marriage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1885,"content":"<p>In order to qualify for a widower&rsquo;s contributory pension, the surviving spouse must be deemed, under Irish law, to be the legal widower of the deceased.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was previously married in Ireland and subsequently divorced in Northern Ireland.

There are two State pensions related to State pension age.  The State pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested pension funded from taxation, whereas the State pension (contributory) is not means-tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for the latter have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.  The average pension payments made by my Department to men and women over 66 years of age are within approximately 2% of each other.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them. The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the State Pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. Following completion of the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund this year, a refined proposal will be developed. My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas. Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000088#WREE07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":1925,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1926,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[39812\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to reinstate the State transition pension in order to prevent persons forced to retire at 65 years of age having to apply for jobseeker's for one year until they reach the State pensionable age of 66 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1927,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where they are available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  The State Pension (Transition) cost &euro;137 million in 2013.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is estimated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to rise to &euro;87 million by 2020.  These figures do not include future rate increases.  Therefore, reversing this decision would significantly increase the annual cost of State pensions, and reduce the funds available to pay for any future increases in the rate of the payment.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing each year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by some &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may originally have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, an interdepartmental group on fuller working lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a code of practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1929,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[39831\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has been requested to reimburse her department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1930,"content":"<p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) was in payment to the person concerned from 11 October 2012 to 7 June 2017 in respect of one care recipient.<\/p><p>It is a condition for receipt of a CA that the carer is not engaged in employment or self-employment outside their home.<\/p><p>However, where a carer can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate provision has been made for the care of the care recipient in their absence, a carer may engage in employment, self-employment, education or training courses as long as the duration of these combined activities do not exceed 15 hours per week.<\/p><p>Following a review, it was decided that the person concerned was not entitled to CA from 16 June 2016 to 7 June 2017 as he was engaged in employment outside his home in excess of 15 hours per week.

in housing families and individuals, with the scheme currently supporting 38,600 recipients at a cost of &euro;253 million in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is being administered to take account of the on-going rental market difficulties through the implementation of a targeted case-by-case approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  In addition, a protocol arrangement is in place with Threshold and is operational in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute and rent pressure zones are in place covering Kildare, Dublin, Cork, Meath, Wicklow and Galway City.  For 2017 to date, some 1,400 recipients have been supported with increased rent payments above the rent limits. <\/p>  <p>  Rent supplement is a statutory means tested scheme, payable at differentiated rates of payment according to the applicant&rsquo;s means and accommodation requirements, and is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a weekly minimum contribution.  Rent supplement entitlement is generally only reduced if the recipient has had an increase in their assessable means.  Statistics are not maintained on the number of rent supplement payments reduced.  The means assessment and differentiated rates of payment ensures that the payments target those most in need of assistance. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the strategic policy direction of my Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the HAP scheme.  Policy in relation to HAP and new build local authority housing is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1948,"content":"<p>Question No. 736 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":1949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1950,"qnumday":737,"qnumall":"[39886\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position with regard to youth and the long-term unemployed; the progress made in addressing these issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1951,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment &ndash; including long-term unemployment and youth unemployment &ndash; is twofold.  The Action Plan for Jobs supports continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020. <\/p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, the most recent data show that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.7% in August 2017.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 19.1%.<\/p>  <p>  Over the same period, the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland has fallen from a peak of 9.5% to 3.6%.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the youth and long-term figures can be expected to fall further this year and next in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment. <\/p>  <p>  Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed and young unemployed.  For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Youth Guarantee process there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  These current and planned measures, together with the continuing strong performance of the economy, will support further reductions in long term unemployment and youth unemployment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":1952,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1953,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[39887\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF03200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for disability allowance and invalidity pension made in each of the past four years;

Additional appeals officers were appointed and a new operating model and new technology to support appeals officers was introduced.  As a result appeal processing times improved year on year since 2011\/2012.  For example, the average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 28.6 weeks in 2014, 25.5 weeks in 2015 and 24.1 weeks in 2016.  The average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision reduced from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 21.1 weeks in 2014, 18.1 weeks in 2015, and 17.6 weeks in 2016.  <\/p><p>There has been a slight increase in overall appeal processing times to date in 2017 with appeals requiring an oral hearing taking an average of 25.5 weeks and summary decisions taking 19.1 weeks to finalise.  However the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that processing times should improve when a number of recently appointed Appeals Officers who replaced more experienced colleagues who retired become more experienced in their roles.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including the time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the system impacts on appeal processing times which are proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which often require a high level of judgement, in addition to the need to ensure due process and natural justice. <\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that every effort will continue to be made to improve appeal processing times. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2014 &ndash;

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record. It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level.  This includes analysing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. <\/p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. <\/p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those aged under 25 years who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":1961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1962,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[39890\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the previously self employed and current unemployed are able to access the relevant welfare payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1963,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship.  This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime and, very importantly, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed people.   <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which covers them for access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as some treatment benefits, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and guardians payment (contributory).  <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2017, Class S contributions have enabled self-employed people access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits. <\/p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors will be covered for invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.

These include the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) until the youngest child is 7 years of age and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) payment where the youngest child is aged 7-13 years.  The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment can also be paid to lone parents where the youngest child is aged 14 or over.  The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is also available to lone parents who are working 19 or more hours per week.  Lone parents who move to FIS can also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).<\/p>  <p>  In most cases entitlement to the OFP payment ends when the youngest child reaches 7 years of age, however, there are special provisions for those caring, in receipt of Blind Pension or recently bereaved that extend the age of the youngest child beyond 7 years of age.  The majority of customers transition from OFP to the JST, FIS or JA schemes when their OFP entitlement ends.<\/p>  <p>  Lone parents who are not working outside the home can transition to JST when their OFP ends.  These customers do not suffer an income loss when they move to JST as JST is paid at the same rate as OFP.  Budget 2016 aligned the JST means test more closely with the OFP means test resulting in a more generous means test for JST customers.  Budget 2017 also increased the income disregards on OFP and JST to &euro;110 per week.  This in effect means that lone parents who are working and earning less than &euro;110 per week see no change in their welfare payment when they move from OFP to JST.  Those earning over &euro;110 per week may lose a maximum of up to &euro;7.60 per week.  This is due to the banded rates for OFP compared to JST.  <\/p>  <p>  Lone parents who transition to FIS may suffer an income loss however, they also gain access to the BTWFD.  It is important to note that lone parents on FIS have been lifted out of poverty due to a combination of earnings and the FIS supports.  It is not possible for a lone parent to be in receipt of FIS and be within the definition of consistent poverty.  Lone parents who increase their hours of work and become new FIS recipients will see an increase in their overall income. <\/p>  <p>  Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 have all included measures that benefitted lone parents.  The Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of the impact of Budget 2017 showed an increase of 1.2%, equating to just over &euro;8 per week for working lone parents, and 4.5% equating to just over &euro;16 per week for those who are not working.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 of almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and just over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.  This shows definite progress with the commitment to reducing poverty for lone parents and their families. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these income supports lone parents also have access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and the associated training, education and employment supports to assist them towards employment and financial independence.  All JST recipients receive a one to one meeting with a case officer from the Department who assists them to produce a personal development plan and guides them towards appropriate education, and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the JST payment access to these supports are potentially available for up to seven years.  This is a much broader support than the 12 month engagement that normally applies for jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Lone parents on a JA payment also gain access to the full range of Intreo supports available to assist them into training, education and employment.  <\/p>  <p>  The income and activation supports outlined above combine to ensure that there are effective resources available to lone parents. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1967,"content":"<p>Question No. 743 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1968,"content":"<p>Question No. 744 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":1970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Register of Electors","counter":1969,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1970,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[39292\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000089#WRFF04800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the persons entitled to vote in referendums and Presidential elections here;

Once the local authority is satisfied that the accommodation meets the needs of the household and conforms to standards for rental accommodation, which are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, the property can be brought into RAS.<\/p>  <p>  Where possible,\u00a0local authorities are guided to agree rents which equate to circa one month's rent less than the market rate over a given 12 month period (annualised saving of 8% on market rate) to represent the level of risk transferred to each local authority.  However, where there is difficulty in a local authority securing RAS accommodation, there is flexibility in relation to the discount in market rates, at the discretion of the individual local authority.  A local authority may also allocate a property to a social housing tenant if a RAS tenancy cannot be sourced.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of properties where landlords have maintained rents at levels substantially below the rents currently being sought has come up in the review of the Rent Predictability Measure and the operation of the Rent Pressure Zones.\u00a0 In a Rent Pressure Zone the rent increases available to these landlords will be well below those achievable by landlords who have been charging higher rents and driving the rent inflation in the area.\u00a0 The review has considered the potential implications for\u00a0RAS tenancies.\u00a0 Any changes found by the review to be necessary will be addressed in the wider review of Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2016, local authorities report that\u00a0there were 20,306 households \u00a0supported by RAS.

It means that, from 2017 onwards, local authorities will no longer retain PRD locally, thus reversing the previous approach.

This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities to advance their housing delivery.  Within the overall 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year, some 4,500 of these will be delivered through new builds\/acquisitions\/refurbishments and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction. <\/p><p>A comprehensive status report of social housing schemes for all local authority areas can be accessed at the following link: .

It also shows those progressing through planning, design and construction.  Details in respect of Quarter 2 of 2017 will be published shortly on the Rebuilding Ireland website.<\/p><p>These 607 projects are funded under a range of different initiatives such as local authority construction, turnkey developments, rapid delivery, regeneration programmes and construction and turnkey developments by Approved Housing Bodies.

The accommodation sourced should be within the limits of the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.\u00a0HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet, on the dedicated HAP website, www.hap.ie, and local authority staff are expected to explain them to each HAP applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the pressures in the rental market, the Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP scheme across the country with effect from 1 July 2016. Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date. Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% (enhanced support under the Homeless HAP scheme is statutorily provided for in the\u00a0Dublin Region)\u00a0above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  From available data,\u00a0at\u00a0the end of Q2\u00a02017, 17.8% of the total number of households\u00a0 being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.\u00a0When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 12.6% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord. Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household to ensure the landlord receives the full amount of rent charged for the property as set out in their tenancy agreement. In cases where the tenancy would clearly not be sustainable,  local authorities have been advised to refuse HAP support for the\u00a0accommodation sourced.\u00a0It is also important to remember that households in receipt of HAP support can work full-time without losing their housing support, which is not the case for Rent Supplement recipients.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, decisions in relation to levels of HAP support made available to individual households are a matter for the local authority concerned. Equally local authorities must assess the sustainability of each tenancy where a tenant proposes making additional payment beyond the HAP Payment to the landlord. The increased flexibility provided to local authorities offers them, as housing authorities, more capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Currently over 27,000 households are having their housing needs met via HAP.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000091#WRHH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges","counter":2094,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000091#WRHH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":2095,"qnumday":794,"qnumall":"[39580\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000091#WRHH05300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a person must pay their water bill in order to purchase a local authority house through the incremental purchase scheme, in view of the fact that refunds are now being issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2096,"content":"<p>The current position is that, pending any legislative change, arrears of water charges incurred by households remain to be discharged before the sale of a dwelling.\u00a0 Under Section 3(A)(9) of the Water Services Act 2014 (inserted by Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2015) a person who is a tenant of a dwelling let to him under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014 and who proposes to purchase the dwelling shall before completion of the sale provide the local authority concerned with a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming that any charge under section 21 of the No. 2 Act 2013 in respect of the dwelling owed to Irish Water has been paid.

Samuel Beckett<\/i>, attended the bi-annual Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition in London last week. The event ran from Tuesday 12th September 2017 to Friday 15th September 2017. The visit of the ship followed a request from Babcock International, the company responsible for the build of <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>and her sister ships in the Naval Service fleet, <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats<\/i>. Babcock International is currently in the middle of building a 4th sister Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) for the Irish Naval Service which is due for delivery in 2018. This ship is to be named <i>L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw<\/i>.<\/p><p>The attendance of <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>at the exhibition was an opportunity to portray, to a wide audience, the considerable level of commitment and investment made in recent years towards protecting and safeguarding Irish territorial waters, by showcasing the success of the Offshore Patrol Vessel design and build capabilities. This design and build process for the current OPVs has involved a long and cooperative contractual relationship with the Department of Defence and the Naval Service with Babcock International&rsquo;s Appledore shipbuilding facility in Devon in the UK. <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Niamh<\/i>were also built in the same shipyard, some fifteen or more years ago. Given the Department&rsquo;s and the Naval Service&rsquo;s involvement with the company during the course of the shipbuilding contracts, I approved a positive recommendation from my Department for the attendance of the ship. <\/p><p>It is not considered that the attendance of the ship at the event compromised our neutrality in any manner. In that regard, it is clearly understood that Ireland will continue to maintain a policy of military neutrality characterised by non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements. <\/p><p>No additional advantage or benefit was received by the Naval Service or the Department of Defence, and no additional costs arose to the Defence Organisation as a result of the attendance of the ship at the exhibition. <\/p><p>In addition to the attendance of <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>, the event was attended by a number of Department of Defence and Defence Forces personnel. This is standard practice within the Defence Organisation and attendance of personnel has been a feature at previous exhibitions. It is best practice in Defence acquisition to carry out product and services research at major shows of this nature. The estimated cost of travel and subsistence for the attendance of these personnel is &euro;4,500. <\/p><p>The purpose was to visit the many exhibition stands involving the wide range of companies that the Defence Organisation deals with on a regular basis. These include companies involved in the land, sea and air environments, all of which are of interest to the Defence Organisation given the various roles of the Defence Forces at home and overseas. It was also an opportunity to visit the stands of several Irish companies exhibiting. <\/p><p>The exhibition provided personnel with a valuable opportunity to meet key suppliers across the full spectrum of military and defence equipment and activities. This ties in to the primary purpose for the procurement of such defensive equipment by the Department of Defence which is to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces. Attendance at such events is necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to fulfil all roles assigned by Government both at home and overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000092#WRJJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Medals","counter":2149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000092#WRJJ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2150,"qnumday":816,"qnumall":"[39680\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092000092#WRJJ04600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the date on which commemorative medals will be issued to the surviving veterans of the siege of Jadotville and family members of those since deceased; if he will liaise with the organisers of the annual Jadotville day commemoration that will take place in Athlone, County Westmeath on 21 October 2017 to try and ensure that the medals are presented on that day of celebration to minimise the travel and inconvenience to the elderly veterans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":2151,"content":"<p>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe):  On the 13th June last I decided to award a medal to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to family representatives of deceased members, to give full and due recognition in honour of the courageous actions of the men during the siege at Jadotville in September 1961.
