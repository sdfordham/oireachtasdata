Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.<\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices; they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment. The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.<\/p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.

Such an over production occurred in the 2014\/2015 milk quota year - the final year of the milk quota regime.

The make-up of this increased output will include shellfish, finfish, novel species and seaweed in a variety of different production systems, both intensive and extensive. <\/p>  <p>  Given the very wide variability of production systems and the large number of species being farmed, with more to be added into the future, the Plan notes that it is not feasible to offer a meaningful prediction of precisely which species and which production systems will yield the projected increases in specific years.

","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not reviewed.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility,<\/i>which made a recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.<\/p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.<\/p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 103,000 at 1 April 2016.<\/p><p>I can clarify for the Deputy that Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[8628\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will commence; the funding he has allocated for the Decision Support Service in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1243","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality who would be best placed to answer and any questions regarding the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Remuneration","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[8631\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700054#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"why a home help (details supplied), serving in a rural area where there is no public transport and depending on another person for transport to and from clients, is not paid travelling expenses.

The phased roll out of the HAP pilot scheme has proved to be an effective approach and my Department maintains regular contact with the pilot local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise.<\/p><p>I believe the HAP scheme is operating well, with more than 8,700 households currently in receipt of housing support under the scheme. I am committed to the continued rollout of HAP and in that regard, I expect some 10,000 additional households to be accommodated through HAP in 2016. Plans for the roll out of the scheme to the remaining local authority areas are currently being considered. Until such time as HAP becomes operational in the remaining local authority areas, Rent Supplement will continue to be available to those households requiring support in meeting their housing needs in the rental market.<\/p><p>The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in Regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. The Department works closely with DSP and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.<\/p><p>The current table of maximum monthly rent limits for the Housing Assistance Payment is set out in the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2016<\/i>. These regulations are available online on the electronic Irish Statute Book website at: .<\/p><p>In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2015<\/i>provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council. Levels of support provided under the pilot scheme for Homeless Households, which operates across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, were also increased from 20% above to 50% above the current Rent Supplement levels by these regulations. The additional 20% flexibility was also provided to Galway City Council under the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2016<\/i>when they commenced the scheme in February 2016. This additional flexibility facilitates a greater number of qualifying households to source suitable accommodation in these local authority areas. This approach mirrors the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme. My Department has provided the relevant local authorities with guidance on the appropriate use of this increased flexibility.<\/p><p>I will continue to keep HAP rent limits under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700056#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700056#WRF00850"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[8556\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042700056#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if, further to his letter to a person (details supplied), his Department reached the 2015 targets including the 2,000 rental accommodation scheme tenancies; if these tenancies were new tenancies or renewed tenancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level; statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Homelessness Pilot of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, including Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. The focus of the Pilot is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies. While eligible households may source accommodation for themselves with support of the pilot scheme,   a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, is also in place which engages directly with property-owners and supports qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.

Under the programme, funding will be distributed by Local Action Groups to rural communities in line with the local development strategies that are currently being developed within each sub-regional area in Ireland. As the value of the LEADER element of 2014-2020 Programme is less than the LEADER element of the 2007-2013 Programme, the allocations made on a county basis under the new Programme have inevitably reduced.<\/p><p>In determining the county allocations for the 2014-2020 LEADER programme, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding.  However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county.<\/p><p>The methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage.
