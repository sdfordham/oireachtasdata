While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery. <\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46 million of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.  <\/p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and\/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS services could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected.  Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before. It may be possible to take any savings that arise and use them for enhancing local service delivery or indeed offering additional services.  It is also important to note that neither this option nor any alternative has yet been considered by the Board of CIB.  Accordingly, no decisions have been made by the Board and no proposal has been formally made by it to my Department for consideration.  It is expected that the Design Group proposal, when further developed, will be formally submitted to the Board of CIB for its consideration. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the level of engagement in the process to date, involving all the relevant CIB delivery partners, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service is reflected in the proposal from the Design Group and that a debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the matter is not required at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200053#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment Eligibility","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200054#WRF00175"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[15924\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200054#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide the legislation or the operational guidelines governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme that permits a community welfare officer to request income details of all family members, even those not residing in the family home, when a wife is applying for financial assistance to cover the funeral expenses of her husband, as occurred in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if she will review this case in order that this person is not treated in this manner.

Figures in relation to previous tax years are available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics webpage at . This information can be found under the heading &quot;Income Tax and Corporation Tax - Costs of Credits, Allowances and Reliefs&quot;, at . Updates will be published on Commissioners' website in due course.<\/p><p>I am advised that a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax relief for dental expenses alone is not available. As the Deputy notes, routine dental treatment such as the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures is currently excluded from the relief. As a result, information on expenses in relation to routine dental treatment is not required to be returned to Revenue. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as they have no data on the additional potential treatments costs or number of claims for tax relief if the scheme were extended to include routine dental treatment, it is not possible to provide the estimated cost the Deputy requested.<\/p><p>The State already provides some support to those who require dental treatment through the schemes detailed below:<\/p><p>(i) <i>Treatment Benefits from the Department of Social Protection<\/i>. It is my understanding that this scheme is available to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. The benefit under this scheme is that the Department of Social Protection pays for an oral examination for a qualifying individual once a calendar year.<\/p><p>(ii) <i>The Dental Treatment Services Scheme<\/i>(DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for adult holders (over 16 years of age). A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment for relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients. This includes 2 fillings per annum and all extractions. <\/p><p>Most other treatments require prior approval and patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs receive priority. The National Oral Health Office issued Standard Operating Procedures to dentists in November 2011 to provide clearer guidance on the application of DTSS prior approval requests (for example, for dentures). <\/p><p>The DTSS provides treatment for periodontal\/gum disease in cases where care is especially warranted. This includes clients who are pregnant, have diabetes or immuno-compromising conditions, or require relevant surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and joint replacements. Approval for periodontal treatment may be given by the local Principal Dental Surgeon for these and other high risk or special needs groups.<\/p><p>The restriction of the Treatment Benefit scheme as it relates to dental treatment in 2010 was expected to lead to savings of &euro;37.5 million. To provide tax relief for routine dental treatment would serve to negate some of the savings achieved from that policy change.

It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when deciding to approve a loan.  I do not interfere with such commercial decisions.<\/p><p>Mortgage lending decisions must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully to the regulatory requirements, both in relation to the financial institution itself, and also with regard to the safeguarding of the borrower's interests.<\/p><p>While mortgage interest relief is being phased out, it may have relevance to the situation outlined in the details supplied.  In Supplementary Budget 2009, it was limited so that interest payable on a qualifying home loan would only qualify for tax relief for the first seven tax years of the life of that loan (7 year rule).  However, in Finance Act 2010, it was extended up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after (i.e. those who purchased in 2004 or after).  Accordingly, individuals who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2012 will continue to be entitled to mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.<\/p><p>It should be noted that, where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the first seven tax years of their qualifying loan are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships.  For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan, a lower interest ceiling applies.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &euro;3,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;6,000 per annum for married couples\/civil partnerships.  Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.<\/p><p>The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  Furthermore, the relief is proportionate to the amount of mortgage interest paid, up to the relevant ceiling.  Therefore, the greater the amount of interest payable, the greater the relief available, subject to the previously outlined ceilings for relief.<\/p><p>This Government is very conscious of the significant concerns and difficulties faced by homeowners, not least in relation to their mortgages.  In addition, the Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I announced my intention to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 <i>or<\/i>if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  As the Deputy will be aware, mortgage interest relief has been abolished for mortgages take out since 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>In the particular case specified, I would have concerns that the introduction of such a credit would merely allow financial institutions to further increase standard variable rates, with the benefit of any tax relief transferring to financial institutions with no net cost reduction for the relevant mortgage holders.  Therefore, I am not predisposed towards the introduction of such a tax credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200056#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200056#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[15905\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200056#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is committed to continuing tax expenditures, that is Government taxpayer support\u00a0in the form of\u00a0the deliberate transfer of public resources, achieved by\u00a0reducing tax obligations with respect to a benchmark tax or reducing or postponing revenue, in support of the credit union movement; if credit unions will continue to be tax exempt in respect of corporate surpluses and reserves; if tax exemption for the income of credit unions will be continued; if these privileges will continue to extend, not only to existing, but also to new, aggregated credit unions, and to credit union representative organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that credit unions that are registered, or deemed to be registered, under the Credit Union Act 1997 are exempt from Corporation Tax by virtue of section 219A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Credit unions are\u00a0not-for-profit member owned financial co-operatives funded primarily by member deposits and existing\u00a0to attain the economic and social goals of their\u00a0members.

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. However, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and\u00a0has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.\u00a0However, as I have\u00a0outlined in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies,\u00a0it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants\u00a0when,\u00a0in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013\u00a0introduced changes to\u00a0Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector and there is some evidence of\u00a0improvements in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.\u00a0In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.<\/p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.

Currently, there are over 4,400 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA. Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports available on its website - .<\/p><p>In relation to costs, expenditure on the Direct Provision system on the Vote of the Department of Justice and Equality since 2008 has decreased from &euro;91.5m to &euro;53.22m in 2014.  RIA's Annual Reports provide a breakdown of this yearly expenditure.  Notwithstanding these significant costs the Deputy should be aware that a Value For Money review of spending by RIA published in 2010 found that an alternative system to Direct Provision would cost <i>twice<\/i>as much &ndash; not including the costs that would arise from a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; which would follow from a full welfare based system with rent supplements and so forth.<\/p><p>In relation to reform, last year the Government set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.  It is chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society.  The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes.  The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims.  Over 40 meetings at plenary and sub-group level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014.<\/p><p>The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents.  It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.<\/p><p>The Chairman has indicated that the Working Group will be in a position to finalise its report before the end of May 2015 after which the Government will then consider the recommendations made therein.<\/p><p>The reference to the NGO Forum on Direct Provision is not understood.

The Deputy is advised that those in the Direct Provision system, whilst including applicants awaiting decisions for extended durations at various stages of the protection process, also includes recent applicants who have spent relatively short periods in the process, those who have taken judicial reviews in the courts against negative decisions on their applications, those subject to deportation orders following negative decisions, and an increasing number of persons who have elected to remain in the Direct Provision system following the granting of refugee status or leave to remain due to difficulties in sourcing suitable accommodation elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a one-off scheme to clear all protection applications currently on hand.  The Deputy may be aware that there is a political commitment among EU Member States against any form of process that would grant residence status to persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged however that the length of time that many applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed particularly in light of the sharp increase in asylum application volumes in 2014 and so far in 2015.  The Deputy may be aware that  an independent Working Group was set up by Government in October 2014 to recommend to the Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers.  One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure.<\/p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices.  The Working Group is due to report to Government with its recommendations by May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I have also committed to introducing legislative change in the Protection area to provide for a single application procedure with a view to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the protection process.  On 25 March 2015 I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, which has been approved by Government.  This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Priorities 2014-2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system.  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for indeterminate periods of time.  The single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and should be granted status and those with no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law. My aim is for the legislation to be enacted by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Working Group on the Protection process and the future publication of the International Protection Bill, a number of measures have already been taken to address the number of cases on hand in the protection system which are yielding significant results.  Various strategies are being utilised to deal with cases on hand including the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays.  The transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013 has resulted in the production of decisions in some 1,000 cases at first instance.  In addition, a further 1,300 subsidiary protection applications have either been withdrawn or deemed withdrawn.  The processing of these cases has been greatly aided by the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work.  Based on the success of the use of the panel it is now planned to expand it and extend its remit to include the processing of asylum applications.<\/p>  <p>  To assist with processing at the appeals stage of the process I have recently appointed nine additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  These members have been selected from those who were considered suitable for appointment following a competitive process involving the Public Appointments Service.  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200060#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":213,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 87 and 88 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200060#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[15937\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200060#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when legislation concerning spent convictions is likely to be enacted, in view of the fact this is a critical issue for those who may have had a minor misdemeanour in their youth which has impacted on their prospects in education or employment.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>The current position is that before the Spent Convictions Bill could be enacted, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.

This has included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem including:<\/p><p>-  specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART);<\/p><p>-  the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears produced by the Central Bank sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears;<\/p><p>-  extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation;<\/p><p>-  the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives; and<\/p><p>-  the mortgage-to-rent scheme which is designed to assist borrowers in an unsustainable mortgage position to remain in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies.<\/p><p>The effective management of the\u00a0mortgage arrears issue\u00a0is, however, an area that remains under continuous review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake\u00a0of personal insolvency solutions. I think that it is also proper to reiterate that the Government's advice has always been that borrowers who find themselves in arrears should engage with their lending institution with a view to reaching a solution to their difficulties and I would encourage people to avail of the available services, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200061#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200061#WRN00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200061#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[15862\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200061#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason for the closure of a playschool (details supplied) in County Cork; if the possibility of continuing the service has been considered by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>Childcare services are provided by private commercial or community childcare providers and decisions in relation to the ongoing provision of services are a matter for the owners or the boards of management of these services. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Cork County Childcare Committee had been working with Dunmanway Community Playschool in an effort to resolve a number of internal issues relating to the delivery of childcare services at the facility.

There are now interventions that can limit the damage to the heart such as thrombolysis (clot busting drugs) and Primary PCI (a type of heart procedure to remove the blockage in the arteries). <\/p>  <p>  Primary PCI is done on STEMI heart attacks (that&rsquo;s about 20% of heart attacks) and is done in a specialist centre by an experienced cardiologist.  To be a specialist centre doing PPCI you need a critical mass of population with a large volume of cases (approx. 200 cases per year) and enough experienced cardiologists to cover a 24\/7 rota (6 or more).  Up to now 3 centres in Dublin have been covering Dublin and surrounding counties.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of Primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI) from three 24\/7 centres in Dublin had proved unsustainable.  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  <\/p>  <p>  The review was informed by advice from the principals involved in PPCI centres in the UK and other European countries and by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24\/7 requirements of this service.  Following a consultation exercise with all relevant hospitals and the National Ambulance Service, the final report recommended that there should be two 24\/7 PPCI centres for Dublin to be located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). <\/p>  <p>  The rationale for two 24\/7 centres for the delivery of PPCI in the greater Dublin area reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller numbers of sites to allow for the concentration of volume and a larger critical mass of trained operators, working within a 24\/7 team that is less dependent on individual personnel and is, therefore, more robust.  This is about starting treatment the moment the paramedic arrives and getting patients to the right hospital in an emergency - rather than just the nearest one only to be transferred later after a delay.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in relation to the treatment of STEMI patients from Wicklow and South Dublin, the requirement for travel time from First Medical Contact to PPCI centre to be within 90 minutes was considered as part of the review, and the report notes that 90 minute travel time for St Vincent's Hospital and St James&rsquo;s Hospital are similar.<\/p>  <p>  The report also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital (SVUH)) in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24\/7 PPCI centres including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, in advance of the implementation of the change to the delivery of the PPCI service in the Dublin area, extensive consultations took place with stakeholders including the Chairs and CEOs of the two Hospital Groups concerned (Ireland East Hospital Group and Dublin Midlands Hospital Group); the CEOs of the relevant hospitals and the National Ambulance Service and I am pleased to note that all are fully supportive of the new arrangements, which were implemented on April 17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200064#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200064#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[15958\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200064#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will re-instate a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12.","asker":"1028","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

However, with the substantial fall off in private construction, very little social housing is currently being provided under Part V.  Informed by a recent review of the Part V provisions, which included a public consultation process, my Department has incorporated the required legislative changes into the General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No 1) Bill which was published in November 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .<\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.

It is estimated that in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered by 2020 under the revised Part V provisions, using a range of delivery options including leasing mechanisms. My Department has written to local authorities highlighting the importance of ensuring that Part V agreements are discharged in ways that maximise the potential for the immediate delivery of social housing units. I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development and I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market.<\/p><p>It is not possible to estimate either the precise number of units that may become available under Part V or their cost.  In targeting the supply of 35,000 additional social housing units under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 over the next 6 years, including units under Part V, the Government has estimated the total cost to the Exchequer at &euro;3.8 billion. The substantial additional funding provided through Budget 2015 will provide the required kick start to the delivery of the targets in the Strategy and I am confident that my recent announcement of over &euro;1.5 billion for the delivery of the targets out to 2017 will meet the full delivery cost of these units.

The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:<\/p><p>. The latest bulletin from 19 April 2015 shows that petrol prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;1.39 per litre while diesel prices (including taxes) were &euro;1.29 per litre. The average petrol price in the EU in the same period is &euro;1.43 while the average diesel price is &euro;1.27. It is worth noting that Ireland is around mid point on the table. At the same time last year petrol prices in Ireland were &euro;1.53 and diesel prices were &euro;1.47 so Irish consumers are getting the benefit of falling prices at the pumps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200072#WRAA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Petroleum and Gas Exploration","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200072#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[15869\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042200072#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of capped oil and gas wells currently in Irish waters; the timeframe a prospecting licence holder is entitled to hold on to these wells; and if there is any charge levied on licence holders for capped wells.","asker":"1083","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>A total of 182 petroleum exploration, appraisal and development\/production wells have been drilled in Irish waters.
