There have been severe reductions in quotas for plaice, haddock and prawns.  This is a serious issue in the south.  The Minister tries to put forward a positive spin by pointing to a 25% increase in a certain quota, but that is a 25% increase on an extremely low base.  It is appalling that we are losing through a reduction in the very valuable prawn quota, for example.  The French have ten times our quota for fishing in our seas, but they are only using a small amount of it.<\/p><p>Successive Governments, including past Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, have neglected to act properly for fishermen in this country.

As has been said, the Irish fisheries industry has been decimated over a number of years.  The EU has been very detrimental to the fishing industry in Ireland, which is the reason so many young people have left the industry.  I was talking to fishermen this morning and they are totally frustrated by the deal that has been made.  They believe it will be detrimental to them, as they have lost important quotas that they needed to keep.  They are also very frustrated by the broader picture.  They still see huge factory ships sailing off our coasts which are taking huge amounts of fish.  There appears to be scant policing of them, while the authorities here are very strict on the Irish fleet.<\/p> <p>As Senator O'Donovan indicated, fishermen here are frustrated when they see boats from other EU countries being allowed to catch much larger quotas of fish in Irish waters.  Those involved are particularly worried about the proposals in respect of whitefish stocks and the lack of progress on a deal between the EU, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland regarding quotas.  Vessels from the latter countries are entering our waters and fishing them at will.  I accept that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is quite amenable to coming before the House but an urgent debate is required on this matter.  The \"Ho, ho, ho\" was taken out of Christmas for most fishermen when they heard the details of the agreement that has been reached.  It had been stated that, based on science, we would receive a much better deal.  However, it appears we have been completely let down by science in this instance.

This morning I have been working on the case of a lady in her 30s who has cancer and whose medical card has been taken away.  I do not understand how anyone with any level of compassion or understanding could remove such a person's medical card.  We must begin to look at matters in a more compassionate and humane way.  I may table an amendment to tomorrow's Order of Business in respect of this matter.  I trust that the Deputy Leader will try to make some time available between now and the end of the week in order that the House might discuss the HSE's national service plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800005#D00700","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1387363800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The one matter on which I can agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien is that he should go to the Garda with whatever information he has in his possession.

If the Oireachtas is to ensure the country does not end up in another bailout in the future as a result of bad economics, bad governance or bad politics, it must guarantee that all activities - be they public or political in nature - are carried out in the most transparent and honest fashion possible.  I know nothing about NAMA other than what I have read in the newspapers but it is not unfair to suggest that questions must be answered.  Taxpayers will eventually foot all of the bills in and we must ensure their money is not wasted.  Public reassurance is required.

I am astonished that the service plan makes provision for a reduction of &euro;294 million in expenditure on primary health care given that the Minister of State with responsibility for primary health care stated in this Chamber only weeks ago that greater investment in primary health care is needed.  She also stated that primary health care was the focus of the Government.  One of the core and continuing election pledges of the parties in government was to make free general practitioner care available to all by the end of the next Government term, presuming this Government will be re-elected.

Under the plan, the number of whole-time equivalent posts in the health service will also fall by 2,600 next year, having been cut by 12,500 posts since 2007.  How, in God's name, can hospitals and the health service continue to function and provide the services people need with almost 13,500 fewer staff and &euro;4 billion less in funding?

In each of the past two years, I have spoken in the run-up to Christmas about a homeless gentleman I used to see on the steps opposite the front gate of Leinster House.  I have not seen him there so far this year.  I shudder to think where that poor man might be at this time.  Homelessness is a big problem.  Representatives of many charities have spoken about the challenges facing homeless people and highlighted the increase in the number of homeless people in Dublin.  Regardless of the state of our economy, we have a responsibility to ensure we eliminate homelessness.  As a country, we have the ability to do so.  There should be no need for people to beg on the streets of Dublin or any other city or town in Ireland.  I do not know how we will go about the elimination of homelessness, but there should be a discussion on it.  This House should be challenging the Government, and Senators as citizens, to come up with better ways of doing business and better ways of eliminating homelessness.  All of this feeds into the completely new approach to charity that is needed in this country.  I believe donating to charity should be seen in the same way as paying tax.  When we pay tax, we expect full accountability.  When people donate to a charity box, they should also expect full accountability.  At the end of the day, it is the citizen's money.

It is not good enough that the deadline for submitting amendments should pass before the Second Stage debate starts, but that is what we have seen again this week.  The Government wants us to get our amendments in before the deadline, even though it has no intention of looking at them, because it sees us as a rubber stamp.

Senator Clune also raised the issues highlighted in &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night on what appear to be abuses and inappropriate practices by a charity that provides residential places for recovering drug addicts.  I saw the programme and I know many others will have seen it.  It raised some very serious issues relating to the need for the regulation of charities and the charitable sector, for which many of us in this House have called.

We all join Senator O'Donovan in conveying our gratitude and appreciation to the Garda for that apparently very successful operation.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Donovan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to bring the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the House today to speak about fishing quotas and the ongoing negotiation.  I cannot accept that amendment.  The Minister spoke on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning about the deal that has been done.  He says that, overall, the agreement is positive,the quotas are higher than they were a few years ago, particularly in the vital area of prawns, there have been increases in the quotas for fish like monkfish and hake, and he does not accept claims that this will cost jobs.  He accepts there are cuts to cod, whiting and haddock but suggests it is a good deal overall.  I accept that others have pointed out there have been difficulties for the fishing industry in Ireland for many years because of EU quotas.  I think we all accept that but the Minister has been very good about coming to this House to talk to us about agreements reached at EU level.  I am sure he will have no difficulty coming to the House in the near future.  I just cannot accept that amendment for today.  I ask colleagues to look at the Order of Business for today, see the amount of legislation we have and note the change made by the Leader last night in recognition of points raised by Senator Wilson, as a result of which the Order of Business today has changed.  I will come to that later.  We have a very full legislative agenda today.<\/p><p>  Senator Comiskey was looking for a debate on agriculture in terms of Pillar 2 funding and I will pass that on to the Leader.  Senator Norris spoke about the reports today about the pricing of vegetables.  I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has spoken about this matter this morning.  Senator Norris will be delighted to hear that the Minister has said new legislation will be introduced within weeks if not months to bind supermarkets to the terms of contracts they have signed with food producers.  He said the legislation will protect primary producers to ensure the contracts they have signed are fully respected.  Clearly, there is an aggressive price war that is a matter of concern, but there is a response to that.  I know Senator Norris also spoke about the oldest shop in Parnell Street and I share his view on that.  He also spoke about the fisheries quotas to which I have responded.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke spoke about NAMA and the concerns raised by many.  I have dealt with that.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh congratulated Eddie Downey on his election as the new president of the IFA.  I think all of us will share the Senator's sentiments.  Others have also expressed their congratulations and support for Mr. Downey.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh also spoke about the fisheries quotas.  I think I have answered that.  I will pass on to the Leader the fact that there have been a number of requests for a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the near future and we will try to arrange that as soon as we can.<\/p><p>  Senator Kelly congratulated Eddie Downey and spoke about the need for a debate on poverty.  In particular, he raised a question about self-employed persons who should not be refused social welfare.  There are perhaps two debates here.  There is certainly a debate on poverty.  I will pass that on to the Leader because I know others have been looking for it.  The Senator and others called for a debate on homelessness.  Perhaps a question needs to be asked about the regional differences in respect of social welfare entitlements, which might be raised as a matter on the Adjournment if there are specific cases where that has arisen.<\/p><p>  Senator MacSharry called for a debate on the HSE health service plan.  I will pass that on to the Leader.  I know the Senator is not proposing an amendment today.  I am sure we will have the opportunity to debate that in the new year, if not this week.  There are two health Bills before us tomorrow and I know colleagues will be raising some issues with the Minister for Health then.  We all welcome the adjusted reduction in savings from medical cards contained in the plan announced yesterday.<\/p><p>  Senator Coghlan spoke about NAMA and the duty to report.  Again, I think I have dealt with that.  Senator Bradford also spoke about NAMA.  I will pass that on to the Leader but there have been other suggestions about more appropriate places to raise the issues.<\/p><p>  Senator Keane spoke about wind farms and the pilot training college in Waterford.  The Cathaoirleach has suggested that this would be a good topic to raise on the Adjournment and I would agree with that.<\/p><p>  Senator Cullinane spoke about the HSE service plan and primary health care.  Again, I will pass on to the Leader the fact that there has been a request for a debate on that as early as possible.<\/p><p>  Senator Higgins spoke about NAMA.  I think I have responded to that.  Senator Byrne congratulated Eddie Downey and we would all share in that.  Senator Mullins spoke about NAMA.  I have pointed out the useful comment that the Committee of Public Accounts or the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform might invite in the executive board of NAMA to question it about all the matters that have been raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien and others.  Senator Mullins also congratulated Eddie Downey and the Garda.  Again, we share in that.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames was looking for three debates.  One of them was on the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  There has been no dropping back by Fine Gael to keep the Labour Party happy on amendments to the Bill and the Senator should not believe everything she reads in <i>The Phoenix<\/i>.  I also read that article.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has utterly refuted the claims made in the article.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800008#G00600","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387365600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387365600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The Deputy Leader, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800008#G00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387365600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I should say that the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will continue to deal with the Legal Services Regulation Bill in the new year.

I am sure we can accede to that in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke about NAMA, complimented Senator Darragh O'Brien and supported Senator Kelly's call for a debate on poverty.  Again, I think there are two debates for which Senators Conway and Kelly are looking for.  One is on poverty, perhaps with the Minister for Social Protection, and the other is on homelessness, which should be a separate debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning.  I know the Minister of State has been developing a plan.  I think Senator Conway is quite right.  We need to challenge the Government on the plan to eliminate homelessness, particularly on its implementation.  This is not the first Government that has sought to eliminate homelessness but it is a matter of grave concern to see how many are homeless - those who are visibly homeless but also those who are homeless on waiting lists.  We need to have that debate in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson commended Senator Darragh O'Brien and asked for a new year's resolution to be adopted in this House.  As the Senator said, he is pushing an open door.  He is right in saying that successive Governments have been guilty of trying to ram through legislation at the end of the summer and Christmas terms in particular, and that it is not good legislating, as I said on the record of this House last night.  We should all join in commending the Leader on listening to and taking on board what we all said last night and changing the Order of Business in the course of the debate last night in order that Report Stage of the Water Services (No. 2) Bill did not conclude last night but has been included on today's Order of Business.  I remind colleagues that there are changes to the schedule in the Order of Business that I announced this morning.  These changes are very positive in terms of giving us more time to debate legislation when it had originally been sought to push through this legislation much more quickly.  Other colleagues will be interested to know we had a meeting on Seanad reform with the Taoiseach.  These are very useful and positive developments.<\/p> <p>Senator D'Arcy spoke about NAMA legislation.  He made the point that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigates allegations rather than the Minister for Finance.  Senator D'Arcy very helpfully suggested that John Major would be a very appropriate person to invite to speak to the House as a distinguished speaker, in particular as it is the twentieth anniversary of the Downing Street Declaration.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered the matter of distinguished speakers and agreed to consider a list of potential distinguished speakers at its first meeting in the new year.

Senators will be aware that we passed all Stages of the Bill in this House before the summer and that we had amended it to include a new issue in the D&aacute;il, which is what brings me back to this House.  I understand we will take the 13 amendments before the House in four groupings.<\/p><p>A total of 13 amendments were proposed and approved on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The most substantive aspect of the amendments proposed related to the introduction of a new part 7A which will enable me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide by regulation for a new sick leave arrangement for the public service.  The regulation made under this legislation will reflect the binding recommendation of the Labour Court from 2012.  The regulation will be laid before both Houses.  The final part of the Labour Court determination was only presented to the Labour Court on Monday and we are waiting for its final binding decision in regard to one aspect of that.  I will provide information on the substantive provisions relating to sick leave, which is what I believe people will want to speak about, when I am speaking to the second group of amendments.<\/p><p>The first group we are discussing includes amendments to the definition of public service body in the principal Act, the repositioning of the definition of public service body applicable to redeployment and consequential amendments.  There are six amendments in this group.  These relate to what was the original Bill we discussed.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 provides for the reinstatement of the definition of &quot;public service body&quot; which will apply to the recruitment and appointment function of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in section 2(1) of the principal Act.  The earlier version of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Bill 2013 introduced two definitions of &quot;public service body&quot; into section 2(1) of the principal Act.  The first definition was to apply in respect of the recruitment and appointment function of the PAS and the second was to apply in respect of redeployment.  In the interests of clarity and transparency, it is considered that one definition of &quot;public service body&quot; should appear in section 2(1) of the principal Act, relating to the recruitment and appointment functions of the PAS, and that the definitions applicable to redeployment and to the new sick leave remuneration should appear in their own Parts of the Bill, that is, Part 6A and Part 7A, respectively.  It will be easier for people wanting to know exactly what the law is to read it in a joined-up, whole way, so to speak.<\/p><p>The definition has been amended slightly since the last version of the Bill to reflect two technical amendments.  The first specifies that the definition applies &quot;other than for the purposes of Parts 6A and 7A&quot;.  This is because broader definitions of &quot;public service body&quot; will apply in respect of Part 6A, which concerns redeployment.  Part 7A, as I said, will concern sick leave remuneration.<\/p><p>The other technical amendment refers to &quot;an education and training board&quot; rather than to &quot;a vocational education committee&quot;, VEC.  This is to reflect changes introduced by the enactment of the Education and Training Boards Act of 2013.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to reposition the definition of &quot;public service body&quot; that applies in respect of redeployment from section 2 of the principal Act to Part 6A of the principal Act alongside the other definitions applicable to deployment.  This is simply replacing it in order that it can be read more clearly.  This definition of public service body applicable to redeployment is broader than the definition applicable to the recruitment and appointment functions of the PAS under section 2(1).  It is the definition of public service body that appeared in the earlier version of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2013 except for one technical amendment.  To reflect changes introduced by the Education and Training Boards Act of 2013, the definition refers to &quot;an education and training board&quot; rather than &quot;a vocational education committee&quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5, a technical amendment necessitated by amendment No. 4, involves the renumbering of the section beginning &quot; 'recognised trade' &quot;.  Amendment No. 6, again a technical amendment necessitated by amendment No. 4, involves the renumbering of the section beginning &quot; 'redeployment day' &quot;.  Amendment No. 7, a technical amendment again necessitated by amendment No. 4, involves simply renumbering of the section beginning &quot; 'a reference' &quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12, the final amendment in this group, seeks to exclude commercial State bodies and their subsidiaries from the definition of &quot;public service body&quot; in both Part 6A, which concerns redeployment, and Part 7A, which concerns sick leave remuneration, through the extension of the application of Schedule 3 to Part 6A and Part 7A.<\/p><p>That is the first group of amendments.  They are, by and large, technical in nature simply to allow for the more substantive arrangements that will apply to sick leave, which will be the next group we will discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800013#M00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1387367400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>As no Member is offering I call the Minister to speak to group 2, insertion of Part 7A on sick leave remuneration and consequential amendments, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 10 and 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800013#M00700","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1387368000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Group 2 is the more substantive group and contains the meat of what I want to achieve today.  There are four amendments in this group which relate to the introduction of the new sick leave scheme for the public service.  Given the relatively substantive change to the Bill during Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I would like to take some time to outline the new provisions relating to sick leave.<\/p><p>  A motion of instruction was passed in the D&aacute;il last week enabling some amendments to be included in the Bill which will allow me, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide, through ministerial regulation, for a new sick leave scheme for the public service.  When we were dealing with the Second Stage of this Bill in late September, I advised the D&aacute;il of my intention to bring forward provisions relating to sick leave on Report Stage. <\/p><p>  As Members of this House will be aware, the rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave for the public service overall and this is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will be available.  The reduction in paid sick leave under the new scheme will reflect exactly the binding recommendation of the Labour Court.  In accordance with the Labour Court recommendation, the regulation will provide that the new sick leave scheme for the public service includes a maximum of three months on full pay in a year followed by a maximum of three months on half pay, subject to a maximum of six months paid sick leave in a rolling four-year period.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Labour Court recommended that special arrangements were to be put in place, through the development of a critical illness protocol, under which staff with serious illnesses or injury might be able to benefit from extended paid sick leave on an exceptional and normally non-recurring basis.  In effect this means that staff covered by the critical illness protocol would continue to have the same level of support that is available under the current sick leave scheme.  This protocol, which is at an advanced stage of development, is the subject of ongoing consultation with the public service unions and was referred back to the Labour Court earlier this week for a binding recommendation on a limited number of issues. <\/p><p>  While the new sick leave arrangements could be applied in some sectors, such as the Civil Service, by administrative circulars, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that legislation is required to ensure that the new public service sick leave scheme can be applied across the public service, particularly as many public servants have employment contracts that are governed by private contract law. <\/p><p>  Against this background group 2 amendments relate to the insertion of the new sick leave provision.  Amendment No. 2 is necessary to facilitate the insertion of Part 7A into the principal Act.  Section 7 sets out a number of positions and appointments that are excluded from the provisions of the principal Act.  It is proposed to amend the existing provision in the Bill to ensure that these exclusions do not affect the Minister in making regulations on sick leave remuneration.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 is necessary to facilitate the insertion of part 7A into the principal Act.  It had already been provided in the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, that redeployment by the public service appointments service to unestablished excluded positions in the Civil Service would not require the separate sanction of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA.  This amendment provides that the application of the new sick leave scheme does not require the separate sanction of the CPSA.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert a new part 7A, which comprises sections 58A to 58C, into the principal Act and is the substantive amendment to the Bill.  As I have already outlined, the overall purpose of part 7A is to make legislative provision for a sick leave scheme for the public service and to give the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the statutory authority to set out the scheme in more detail in the regulation, having regard to certain principles and policies.  Section 58A specifies how certain terms, including &ldquo;condition&rdquo;, &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; and &ldquo;sick leave&rdquo;, are to be interpreted for the purpose of part 7A.  This section provides a broad definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; which, when applied in conjunction with the separate definition of &ldquo;public servant&rdquo; in this section of the Bill, will define the potential extent of coverage of the new sick leave scheme. <\/p><p>  Taken together, the definitions of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; and &ldquo;public servant&rdquo; are broad enough to mean that the generality of all public servants working in public service bodies may be covered by the new sick leave scheme.  The ministerial regulation that will then be drawn up under the new part 7A will specify the public servants to whom the new scheme will apply.  The definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; for the purposes of sick leave remuneration is broadly modelled on the definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; in section 5 of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.<\/p><p>  The only explicit exclusion from the scope of the sick leave provisions are commercial State bodies and their subsidiaries.  These are listed in Schedule 3, which was inserted by section 7 of the Bill, and specifies the bodies to which the definition of public service body does not apply.  In addition, there are a limited number of groups who are not included in the definition of public body and public servant the Permanent Defence Forces will not be included in the new scheme as the Defence Forces regulations are the appropriate vehicle for the amendment of any sick leave arrangements in that sector.  Notwithstanding this, there will be reductions in the access to sick pay in the Defence Forces.  My Department is in ongoing negotiations with the Department of Defence about the introduction of those changes. <\/p><p>  Civilian employees of the Defence Forces are specifically listed to provide certainty that they are included; civilian employees are not civil servants, they are specifically excluded from the Civil Service Regulation Act 1953 by section 20(2)(<i>d<\/i>) of that Act and they are not members of the Permanent Defence Force.  A limited number of other groups are not covered by the definition of public service body and public servant, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the Judiciary, a Member of the European Parliament for a constituency in the State, being a Member who is in receipt of the salary specified in section 2(2) of the European Parliament (Irish Constituency Members) Act 2009.  The specific public service bodies to which the scheme will apply will be set out in the regulation that gives effect to this legislation.  It is my intention to cover all areas of the public service with the exception of those areas I have just mentioned.  Specifically that will include public servants in the health sector, the local government sector, the civil service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  <\/p><p>  The education sector will be joining the scheme in September 2014 at the start of the new school and third-level year.  This approach, which reflects negotiations in the Labour Court, makes the most sense for that sector from an administrative perspective as leave and sick leave arrangements in the education sector relate to the school year rather than the calendar year.  Section 58B empowers the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make regulations providing for the payment of remuneration to a public servant during a period of sick leave.  Section 58B(1) provides that the Minister can determine the rate of pay that should be paid during periods of sick leave.  The rate of pay can be expressed in terms of full pay; a percentage of full pay; or a combination of full pay and a percentage of full pay.  This provision is a prerequisite to the introduction of the new sick leave scheme and is in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation.<\/p> <p>I want to underscore again and again that what we are doing is simply transposing into law what is the binding recommendation on all parties of the Labour Court.<\/p><p> Section 58B(2) provides that no sick leave remuneration will be paid in instances where an individual has exhausted the sick leave limit set.  This provision is required to ensure that the standard sick leave scheme is applied across the public service and that individuals are not being paid different rates beyond those set out in the regulations I propose to make.<\/p><p> Section 58B(3) provides that the Minister can set the length of time for which an individual will be paid sick leave remuneration.  The length of time can be expressed in terms of days, hours or weeks because, depending on the sector, it may be more appropriate to refer to either days, hours or weeks.<\/p><p> Section 58B(4) sets out the principles and policies to which the Minister must have regard in making these regulations.  These are (<i>a<\/i>) the need to limit the circumstances in which financial resources are committed to paying individuals where the public service does not have the benefit of those services; (<i>b<\/i>) the resources available to the Exchequer to pay public servants; (<i>c<\/i>) the obligations of the State under the fiscal stability treaty; (<i>d<\/i>) the need to have a means of verifying that an individual is unable to come to work due to illness or injury; and (<i>e<\/i>) the need to protect the health of public servants.  These represent a balance between the need of the Minister to have regard to a range of issues, including the financial position of the State, and the need to support public servants who are experiencing bouts of ill health.<\/p><p> Section 58B(5) provides that the regulations may provide in exceptional cases that there may be paid sick leave for a period of time longer and at a higher percentage of remuneration than would otherwise be the case.  This provision will facilitate the introduction of what I have already described as the critical illness protection, which will provide access to extended paid sick leave in circumstances where an individual becomes seriously ill or is seriously injured.  Again, this is in accordance with the recommendations of Labour Court.<\/p><p> Section 58B(6) provides that the Minister can delegate certain decisions in regard to sick leave to a public service body.  Such decisions may include whether an illness or injury is of a serious nature, what an appropriate period of rehabilitation might be and what constitutes necessary medical certification.  This provision is intended to allow for appropriate flexibility in regard to the implementation of the new sick leave arrangements at an organisational level.<\/p><p> Section 58B(7) sets out the transitional arrangements that apply where an individual is already on a period of sick leave when Part 7A is commenced.  Again, in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation, people on sick leave at the time of the commencement of the new scheme will continue to be covered by the existing sick leave arrangements until they return to work.  The new scheme does not click in until they are back in work.<br \/>Section 58B(8) provides that nothing in this section will prejudice the operation of the Social Welfare Acts or any instruments made under these Acts.  Public servants who are class A PRSI contributors claim illness benefit when they are absent from work on sick leave.  The public service employer pays the individual's salary and recoups the illness benefit from the State on behalf of the individual.  This provision clarifies that the Bill will not interfere with that arrangement.  For the sake of clarity, a matter that was raised in the other House concerned exceptional circumstances, although I cannot envisage them, where the remunerated pay was less than a social welfare payment.  In such a case, the balance will be rebated to the public servant.<br \/>Section 58B(9) provides that every regulation made under Part 7A will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas once it is made.  This provision reflects best practice in making regulations.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 13 provides for the insertion of a new sentence into the Long Title of the Bill.  This is to reflect the fact the Bill, as amended, proposes to insert this new Part 7A, which concerns sick leave remuneration into the principal Act.  As the Long Title of the Bill suggests, it amends the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 to provide for redeployment of public servants.  The amendments being brought forward are beyond the scope of the current Long Title so it is proposed to amend the Long Title to provide for regulations concerning sick leave in the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800014#N00100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387368600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>As my colleague suggested in the D&aacute;il, we do not have a huge difficulty with this and, by and large, we support it.

Similarly, as legislators, we should have the regulations in front of us when we are making important legislation as we cannot do our work without the full picture.  I ask the Minister for an update on the regulations and when they will be laid before the House.<\/p><p>Many of the issues were raised in the other House when these amendments were made.  One of them was the issue of retrospection, which I would like to put on the record of the House, given this is a very different Bill from the one we dealt with on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  In a parliamentary question to the Department, my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, asked whether these regulations will include provision to retrospectively apply the new certified sick leave arrangements.  In its response, the Department recounted the necessity to give public service employees advance notice of the new scheme and make provision for a transitional period.  She was informed that access to the new reduced limits of sick leave is not being applied retrospectively.  The Department went on to explain that individual sick leave records will remain unchanged following the legislation and will continue to be used to determine whether an individual has access to paid sick leave and at what rate.  It pointed out that when an individual is absent from work due to sick leave, his or her record over the previous four-year rolling period will be examined to see if the sick leave limits have been exhausted.  This seems to indicate that the new regime will be retrospective.  We would have grave concerns about that and I see it causing some difficulty.<\/p><p>Will the Minister address this issue and explain why we are dealing with this legislation when there are matters still outstanding?

I will deal first with Senator Byrne's questions in regard to what he describes as a rush.  We have signalled this as coming for a very long time.  The initial determination of the Labour Court was in 2012 and it had been my hope and expectation to commence all of this on 1 January.  On foot of a request from the Senator's colleague in the other House, I determined that I would do the detail by way of regulation to give people the chance to read the regulation.  I accepted the amendment his colleague in the D&aacute;il put forward.  Given that I am going to do it by regulation, and in answer to Senator Reilly's point, I cannot draw up the regulation until the legislation is enacted.<\/p> <p> We are awaiting the final element of the Labour Court determination, which is on a narrow set of issues.  I will not go through the whole day's worth of submissions from both parties in the court last Monday, but there is an important issue here in terms of pregnancy-related illness and how it should be covered in the protocol.  We are expecting a binding recommendation from the Labour Court to give additional latitude to pregnancy-related illness, which is something of which I was mindful having heard the same points raised in this regard in the other House.  Once that recommendation is forthcoming, we will be able to draw up comprehensive regulations and make them available to both Houses.<\/p><p> For that reason, we are not pursuing a motion for earlier signature.  My intention to have these provisions commenced in January cannot be realised because it will require a period of time before the regulations can be formerly accepted.  That will push the commencement of the scheme back into later next year.  My intention, therefore, is that the original Bill, which deals with redeployment and which we debated at some length earlier in the year, will be commenced immediately, but the revised cross-sectoral sick leave arrangement will not be commenced until later.  I have not yet fixed a date for that but, realistically, it will probably be 1 March before the regulations are formally laid before and approved by the Houses.  That legislative process will delay the implementation of the provisions, for which I have been criticised in some quarters.  However, it is important that the detail be there as well as the overarching substance.<\/p><p> In regard to retrospection, it is important to be clear on what we mean by the new scheme having retrospective application.  The question of retrospection arises in terms of reviewing an individual's sick leave record over the past four years and using it to determine access to the new scheme.  We debated this issue in the House and it is part of the presentation to the Labour Court.  Assuming we commence the scheme on 1 March, say, we could not have a situation where a person who becomes ill the following day having never taken sick leave before is subject to the new arrangement while another person who, to be diplomatic about it, has an indifferent sick leave record gets his or her slate wiped clean.  That would not be fair and the rationale behind the retrospective element is to avoid such anomalies.  However, the new arrangement will not apply to anybody who is out sick at the time of commencement.  In that circumstance, the old scheme will apply until such time as the individual has recovered and is back in work.<\/p><p> Senator Michael D'Arcy asked about the scope of these provisions.  Other than the categories of workers which I have indicated are excluded, namely, employees of commercial semi-State bodies, members of the Defence Forces and people who do not qualify for sick leave such as Oireachtas Members, the President and so on, the scheme will have broad application.  However, it will apply only to employees who are on the State payroll <i>qua <\/i>payroll as opposed to contract staff.  People employed on contract have a different relationship with the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800015#O00500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387369200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Will the Leas-Chathaoirleach allow me to make a brief query?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800016#P00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1387369200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I am not supposed to allow such interventions, but I will bend the rules to accommodate a very brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800016#P00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1387369200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>It might be just as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800016#P00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1387369200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>My question is a technical one relating to the earlier signature motion.

The regulator reassured me that, as was said in public and quoted in the Oireachtas document, it wants to be proactive in communications.  The process will be that Irish Water will set out its plan with all the costs.  That will be a public document.  The regulator will release that for consultation.  People make their comments on it.  Obviously, the views of Oireachtas Members and members of the public are very welcome and will be treated equally.  We agree it is very important that the Oireachtas invites in the persons concerned, particularly Irish Water, to invigilate and do due diligence on all the issues.  Notwithstanding what Senator Cullinane is saying, I honestly believe this legislation is setting up the framework under which every issue on which the regulator makes a decision is transparent and accountable.  I am satisfied these amendments, notwithstanding the fact Senator Cullinane may oppose them, are good and that the outcome will be productive and constructive, particularly for consumers.<\/p><p>In respect of the ability to pay, the Government said repeatedly that every home will have the free allowance.

There will be transparency about how that will be dealt with, which is very important.  There are other issues that may relate to the role of the regulator which we can deal with in another Bill to come before the House before the charges come in.  Due to the fact that domestic buildings will not be paying a bill until January 2015 at the earliest, there is enough time to deal with all of these issues in order that there is total clarity and consultation.

The previous item was a Christmas goodwill present from the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  I was wondering whether there was a possibility of one this afternoon.  What is the free amount and what is the price?  The Minister of State is asking us to act in the dark on that.<\/p><p>In respect of the amendment's reference to the costs likely to be incurred by Irish Water, the regulator is acting on our behalf and should not accept the costs.  Otherwise, he is not providing the counterweight we all need.  There are some which we have had only this week.  Health insurance costs went up by 86% in four years.  Bus fares are regulated by the National Transport Authority and went up 10% last Monday week.  They have lost about 55 million passengers in five years.  Our electricity prices are 42% above the EU average.  Last week, the Commission for Energy Regulation won a case in the High Court on stranded assets which, according to one interpretation, means we cannot import low-cost gas into Shannon from the US.  Regulators tend to be captured, as we said on previous Stages.  They will submit costs.  What we are looking for somebody who will work harder than these regulators do on behalf of the consumer.  There is reference to the need for that in the Government's economic strategy announced this week.  We have failings in this area.  Water is such a vital commodity for everybody.  I agree with Senator Cullinane that we must have a stronger role for the Oireachtas.  There is much public dissatisfaction with some of these regulators.  Water is a vital commodity and nothing can take its place, as the Minister said so eloquently.  This is why I am worried about amendment No. 40.<\/p><p>To the average citizen, a water charges plan means what he or she will have to pay.  In a previous amendment that was ruled out of order, we put down our estimate of what the free allowance should be.  If the consumption is 145 litres, we wanted to give them 100 litres free.  That is where we got that number.  What water charges mean to the average citizen depends on us having much more information on what the water charges will be.  That is why Senator Cullinane has raised important points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800021#V00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1387371000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Barrett and the House for what happened earlier and acknowledge it.  It is very welcome and shows the objectivity we have in debates, which I very much welcome.  The Oireachtas has invigilating powers, particularly in respect of the water services plan, and will play a very important role in that.  There will be legislation later which will take up some issues relating to the regulatory powers.  This will add to the arguments people are making in respect of the transparency of decision-making and how it is arrived at.  I refer again to the document on the regulator's website which sets out what it will put into the mix in terms of costs such as the capital and operational expenditure, the assets that are transferred, the value of the assets and outstanding loans and liabilities.  It will be a very complex and technical but transparent process which I am happy will help build the confidence we must have in the regulator.  I understand how people feel about regulators.  I know the damage that was caused to our economy, particularly relating to the banks.<\/p> <p>I have every confidence that this process will work.

We only tabled it in this manner because it was the only way we could table a Report Stage amendment that sought to include some sort of ability to pay clause in the charge.  We have at least managed to move an amendment through which to discuss the issue.<\/p><p>  In response to previous contributions, the Minister of State mentioned that the Government would examine issues of a free allowance, affordability and water poverty.  However, our problem is that we do not want to take a leap of faith and vote for a Bill that will allow for water charges in the hope that the Government will ensure protections for low-income families.  Similar amendments were tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and ruled out of order.  It would have been better had an ability to pay element been introduced into the section on a water charges plan.  The clause would have been prescriptive.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the Minister of State might tease out how the Government's affordability mechanisms will work and what provisions will be put in place to support low-income families in particular.  He mentioned sick people.  Obviously, they must be looked after.  However, if the Government is not willing to accept amendments on an ability to pay clause or even an exemption for customers who can demonstrate an inability to pay, which are essentially the same suggestions but worded differently, the Minister of State should inform the House of what the Government means when it claims that it will address the issue of affordability.  This is an important question.<\/p><p>  How will the Government deal with the issue of water poverty?  The Minister of State might have noticed that a report on food poverty was published by the Mandate and UNITE trade unions.  We do not want to see water poverty being reported on in five, ten or 20 years' time and becoming an issue alongside fuel poverty, food poverty and poverty generally.  If the Government is genuine - I am not saying that it is not - about affordability, protecting low-income families and ensuring that we do not create water poverty, the Minister of State should tell us how people will be protected.

In essence, the amendment seeks to eliminate completely from the Bill the memorandum and articles of association of Irish Water.  The more one hears from the Minister of State and the Government, the more one hears the responses to all Members' questions in this House and the more one sees of the Bill, the more and not less concerned one becomes.  I genuinely believe a quango will be established that will take valuable assets from local authorities but that will not take all the liabilities and which eventually will be fattened up and prepared for privatisation.  The Minister of State has indicated this is not the intention and that privatisation is not contemplated in the Bill.  He is correct, of course, because one does not write into a Bill the intention to privatise something at some point in the future.  However, the Bill puts it into the hands of three Ministers, namely, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  At some point in the future, a Government may wish to sell off Irish Water and Members have taken note of what is happening to Bord G&aacute;is Energy and so on.  It is a very real possibility that at some time in the future, Irish Water will be sold off.  In a number of his previous responses while discussing water charges, the Minister of State referred to the obligation on Irish Water to be a profitable company.  This is the kind of language one hears when semi-State bodies are being fattened up for privatisation, that is, one first must make them profitable.  The same was true in respect of bin charges and waste collection.  Such functions were under the auspices of local government but when charges were introduced, the service was no longer subsidised but became something for which people were obliged to pay.  Once the charge was introduced and became a reality, it was not very long before almost every local authority in the State privatised the service and dispensed with it from a local authority perspective.  Consequently, there is a real chance this will happen with Irish Water at some time in the future.<\/p><p>  To revert to the point about charges, which will be under the remit of Irish Water, the Bill reads:<blockquote>Irish Water may, from time to time, and shall when so directed by the Commission, prepare and submit to the Commission a plan ... [this being a] &ldquo;water charges plan&rdquo; ... for the charging of customers for the provision of water services.<\/blockquote>As the Minister of State clarified in his previous contribution, this is the only opportunity Members will have to support or not support a water charges plan or to support or not support water charges.  There will be no supporting legislation and no new legislation.  In essence, if Members pass this Bill, thereby giving the power and the responsibility for the framing of water charges plans and, in consequence, water charges, to the commission and to Irish Water, it will not return to this House.  Members may well have debates and may well have discussions - I am sure they will, once it becomes a reality - but they will not be able to vote on the details or the specifics thereof.  As Sinn F&eacute;in Members have stated throughout the debates on this Bill, this is asking Members to take a major leap of faith and, in effect, to buy a pig in a poke.  Members will not know how much free water will be given to individuals, how people will be protected or whether there will be an inability-to-pay clause.  In fairness to Senator Landy, in his contribution he supported the idea that low income families obviously should be protected.  Nevertheless, he also appeared to be of the understanding that this measure would be reverting to Members by way of legislation.  This will not be the case because this is Members' only chance either to support or not support water charges or the giving of power to Irish Water.<\/p><p>  This is the reason I have tabled this amendment.  Sinn F&eacute;in simply does not buy into the concept of Irish Water.  It is not in favour of putting in place a new quango or of taking assets, power and responsibility from local government to set up a new quango, which will have a board, which will be filled by all sorts of staff at the top and which will control the provision of vital water services.  Eventually, I believe it will be privatised like many other State companies and semi-State companies have been.  There are genuine concerns as to how Irish Water will take shape in practice, some of which were rehearsed yesterday and which have been expressed by the city manager in Dublin.  People have real concerns, both at official level and at elected representative level in local government, on how Irish Water will work in practice.  In the context of a number of amendments tabled yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in Members asked the Minister of State to suspend the Bill and to hold off on its passage until the Government gets its act together because I do not believe this is legislation Members can support.  If Members will pardon the pun, the Minister of State should pull the plug on the Bill until such time as the concerns shared by many are addressed fundamentally.  Thereafter, the Minister of State should return with a Bill Members can support.<\/p><p>  Were the Minister of State to return with a fresh, new Bill that provides Members with the information they require on how all this will work out and in which the mandate is given to the elected representatives in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, not to a third party as this Bill does, as well as asking Members to take a leap of faith, Members might be in a position to support the Bill.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in will not support the Bill when Members essentially are being asked to shoot in the dark.  Members want to be able to support the Bill when they know precisely how this will affect the people outside this Chamber whom they represent.  Even some Government representatives are of this view, even if they do not express it publicly in this Chamber.  I have seen reports of how councillors from Fine Gael and the Labour Party at local authority meetings throughout the State are very exercised and concerned about the establishment of Irish Water.  Moreover, they are making many of the points I am making and which other Senators have made in respect of the lengthy debates in this House.  To be fair, it is not simply my party that has concerns, as people outside this House, ranging from local authority managers to members of Fine Gael and local government representatives, also have concerns.  Consequently, for all these reasons, I have tabled this amendment, which I again intend to press to a vote, because I cannot support the progression of the Bill and certainly cannot support the establishment of Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800027#BB00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387373400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>While I believe we have gone over much of this ground, in respect of amendment No. 45, the memorandum and articles of association are a requirement of the Companies Act to which Irish Water is subject in respect of governance.

The key arguments made with regard to Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann pertain to privatisation, and people on all sides of the House have expressed to me their worries that there would not be and cannot be, privatisation of the company.

I am not saying there is anything sinister in this, and it may be very useful - I do not know.  There is concern in Dublin City Council, for example, about the way in which it has been treated and the fact it claims it is not being paid for &euro;2 billion of assets.  Most of it is leaky pipes so I do not suppose there would be enormous international market, but perhaps there would and I am being naive in thinking there would not be.  There is also the question of the council being left with the pensions of people who it is no longer employing, which might need further investigation, as does the question of equity in charging.

In addition, up to 15% of households receive their water from privately operated group water schemes and some commercial enterprises source their own water supplied by private wells.  Irish Water will operate in a highly regulated environment, closely monitored by statutory agencies.  There are several layers of accountability and transparency envisaged in the legislation before the House.  I believe Irish Water should come within the ambit of freedom of information.  However, it is not ready to do this yet.  I am proposing to exempt it with a view to including it when it is up and running.<\/blockquote>I believe there is a commitment to include it once it is up and running, which will be from 1 January.

My comments are related to the Bill but in a more distant sense.  I raised an issue with the Minister previously in respect of the town of Kells.  However, I am convinced there are other examples throughout the country where local authorities are sharing.  I realise it is in a different context to the amendment.  Kells Town Council currently has a substantial land bank of 350 acres or thereabouts and it is being transferred to Meath County Council.  There are major concerns in the town of Kells about this, particularly the potential for any future sale that could be voted on by members from around the county outside the area of Kells.  At present, the land bank is controlled by Kells Town Council, representing the people of the town who own it.  Has the Minister given any further thought to that?  If not, I intend to draft an amendment over Christmas for Report Stage, if Report Stage proceeds at that point.  If not, I will do it before then.  The idea is to facilitate the easy transfer of land before the Bill is passed, before the commencement or before the elections without stamp duty or any legal complications, other than the standard conveyancing procedures, to allow land such as that to be put into some form of a trust or some protected structure to recognise that these lands do not really belong to the county but to townspeople and are owned on their behalf by the town council.<\/p><p>When I raised this issue in the Seanad there was a major degree of support for my comments from the people of Kells.  Some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues and Labour Party councillors in Kells Town Council would be supportive of it as well.  I have discussed the matter with them privately.  I have no intention of naming names or quoting those involved.  Senator Landy knows some of the councillors involved and the Minister mentioned one to me as well.<\/p><p>This is a major concern in Kells but I am convinced there are other examples throughout the country.  I am certain this is not the only example of a town with a special land bank that was left to the town generations ago by the Headfort estate.  It is seen by the town as belonging to the town.

It happens at local level and that is simply co-operation and good big business practice and organisations sharing back-office services including accounting and so on.

Many town councils had entered into arrangements with their county councils for certain functions to be discharged by the county council, sometimes perhaps by the officials of the county council.  Since town councils are being abolished I would assume that all the particular functions of the town council automatically transfer to the county council.

Much good work has been done by town councils.  Once they are brought into the bigger grouping, particularly where there is a significant increase in the number of members, they will not be anywhere near as effective as at town council level.  That is my personal view but I feel strongly about it.<\/p><p>There were also arrangements between county councils, sometimes because of the specific nature of a service or function.  One county council would have entered into an arrangement with a neighbouring county council to undertake the administration and control of a particular function.  I would have thought, given the new arrangements and this Bill which is changing the scheme significantly, one would go back to zero and that it would be up to those councils to make a decision as to whether they assumed responsibility for what has been transferred to another local authority or enter into a new arrangement.

This amendment reflects the shared service nature of what we will have in the future.  Many Members of the House have said to me, and I am sure Senator Jim Walsh, as a businessman, would agree, that things move on and there are new ways in which we communicate with people and do business.  There will be 83 fewer local authorities and consequent reductions in reports, audits, corporate functions, budgets and various processes.  There will be 192 fewer structures when account is taken of the dissolution of regional authorities, county development boards, county enterprise boards and various other boards.  What we had under Better Local Government - A Programme for Change, with which the Senator will be familiar, was the setting up of a huge number of additional structures in local government, but that did not always mean a better service was provided to the people.  There were directors of services and a mushrooming of additional grades.  This did not mean a more meaningful engagement with the public.  In fact, there was centralisation of all services in national government, particularly since the abolition of domestic rates.  All sorts of agencies have been established that have bypassed local government.  I propose to reverse that trend.<\/p><p>The shared services agenda, which is part and parcel of the public service reform agenda of this Government, is an opportunity for one or more authorities to come together, by agreement, as Senator David Norris has rightly pointed out, to share services for the purposes of efficiency and in order that administrative arrangements can be entered into that are more satisfactory.  The cost of delivering those services, given that people will pay more in user charges at local level, will mean a lesser burden on people who are paying currently, particularly the small business sector.  I would have thought Senator Walsh would have supported me on that issue.  If we are to reduce the burden of commercial rates on small businesses and provide more resources to the priorities of a particular municipal district or between authorities in a region, for example, in the south east if Wexford is of a mind to co-operate with Kilkenny to develop, say, Rosbercon, that can be done under the provisions of this legislation.  That would ensure Waterford and Kilkenny would co-operate better and that Wexford and Kilkenny would co-operate better on various matters.  There has not always been good co-operation.<\/p><p>Equally in regard to executive implementation of the policy decisions of the elected members, a structure is not needed in every town and village to provide a service.  We are not in the horse and cart era any more.  Thankfully, we have moved to the 21st century where we have different means of communications than in 1898.

We tried but failed to work with County Kilkenny on roads.

The Minister raised the issue and I am sure the Cathaoirleach heard him say ,that reducing the burden on small businesses should be an objective.  I fully support that.  However, I also support dynamic, progressive local government systems that will deliver both services, policies and development for its citizens.  I know that in Wexford we resisted increasing the number on the county council for many years, but at the stroke of a pen, the Minister has increased the number from 21 to 34 people.  Everybody, including officials, agrees that it will make it much ineffective.  In effect the Minister is creating talking shops, in place of the more focused business driven local government systems.  The town councils delivered well in each of the towns and I think the direction the Minister is taking is highly regrettable.<\/p><p>I think it is important, and this is the point I am making in amendment No. 99, that the elected members of the local authorities would have the opportunity to review these shared arrangements and see if in fact it will be best practice for the delivery of these services to the people they represent, or whether it should be reviewed and a new approach adopted in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>As I read the Bill, and please correct me if I am wrong, the Minister is stating that any such prior arrangements that had been entered into by management will continue to operate and therefore he is taking it out of the scope of the local authority members who will be elected in 2014 to decide whether that is in the interest of their local authority and communities.  I query the reason for doing this, as I do not see the logic of it.  I think that existing inter-county council arrangements could be planned on a clean sheet from hereon in.  There is significant dismantling of the services that local government have been providing.  It is only appropriate that members conduct a review and then make decisions.

I do not know if Senator Walsh wants the local authority members to become involved in the day-to-day administration and operation of functions.  I do not anticipate that anybody else does.  There is much more oversight being given in this legislation to councillors to make decisions on policy matters and on oversight but one does not expect councillors to become members of an executive team to implement the decisions of a board of directors, which is the elected members of the New Ross municipal district.  Under the Bill the elected members will have more powers and responsibilities in those areas than they had in the past through New Ross Town Council.  Across the country some 70% of all local authorities are accounted for by town councillors but they have 7% of the local government activity  The municipal districts will have more powers, responsibilities and functions than that.  I am sure the Senator will agree that is an enhancement of powers and measures and functions as close as possible to the citizen, rather than having everything - at present 93% of the activity - housed in Wexford County Hall.  I want to devolve responsibility from Wexford County Hall to the municipal districts and not continue the current sham of 7% of all local government activity based around New Ross town council or other town councils.<\/p><p>I have got agreement from Government that the councils will be able to vary the local property tax.  They will have a great deal more discretion to spend money raised at local level based on the priorities of the local areas.  The same councillors elected for the municipal district will be able to go to the county hall plenary session and argue the case, which they cannot do at present.  The councillors at municipal district level will have many more reserved functions than the present town councils.  All the measure we are taking, including in this amendment, will mean saving a significant amount of money through shared services, in fact &euro;4.3 million per annum in payroll and superannuation.  Laois County Council will be the lead authority.  I expect that local authorities in every region will want to come together to deliver a better service.  One does not need all the various layers of management right across the country as we have at present.  We do not need the same level of directors.  The local government staff grading structure is being analysed and worked through by my officials in conjunction with official of local authorities to see what we can do in terms of having efficient delivery of service, with staff being redeployed into areas in which they can do other functions rather than the current functions which perhaps can be delivered in a different way.  Local authorities will be much more involved in economic and community planning and moneys will be channelled through the local authorities and not by-passed through private companies as is happening at present.  What will happen is contrary to what Senator Walsh has said.<\/p> <p>A significant number of additional powers, devolved from central government, are being bestowed at municipal and county level.  There will be a great deal more oversight through the national oversight commission, in respect of which the regional assemblies will have a role to play.  Where best practice can be replicated throughout the country - regardless of location - this will be done.  The amendment is designed to allow the maximum opportunity for policy positions to be adopted a local authority member level.  Equally, if the best way of efficiently delivering services at local level - and saving money for citizens - is on a shared service basis between authorities, then the opportunity to do so is also catered for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800035#LL01900","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387377900,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387377900,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Protection of the Public Interest from Tobacco Lobbying Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1387378200,"counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800037#OO00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1387378200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

Thankfully, due to improvements in treatment I get to give that news more often than I did before.  Nothing sounds better than saying &quot;I think you are cured&quot;.  The worst part of my job is giving people bad news.  All too often, it is the worst news they will ever hear in their lives - the news that they have an incurable fatal illness.  Every day in Ireland, five people get the news that they have incurable fatal lung cancer.  In 95% of cases, their illness was caused by smoking.  The dreadful news that these poor people receive is compounded by the realisation that it was all so unnecessary.<\/p><p>Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland and other western countries.  In addition to cancers of the lung, throat, tongue, mouth, oesophagus, pancreas and bladder, it is a major cause of the other two leading causes of death in Ireland - heart disease and stroke.  It is also a leading contributor to gangrene and peripheral vascular disease.  Emphysema and other forms of chronic lung disease kill 1,500 Irish patients annually and condemn others to a life of misery and curtailed physical function, in which they are fixed to oxygen apparatuses and unable to move.<\/p><p>Tobacco kills approximately 100 times more Irish people annually than illegal drugs.  If it was discovered tomorrow, it would surely be illegal.  Everyone knows smoking is bad for one.  Everyone has heard the message about smoking and cancer.  Most smokers want to quit.

To put it simply, it is addiction.  Tobacco companies must recruit 50 new tobacco addicts daily just to replace the deaths that are caused by their own products.  In 80% of cases, these novice smokers are children.  Big tobacco will deny the reality that its business plan can be summed up in four words: &quot;addict children to carcinogens&quot;.  Big tobacco wants more people to start smoking and wants existing smokers to keep smoking, whereas public health policy is aimed at reducing and ultimately eliminating tobacco use and putting the tobacco industry out of business in the process.  For these reasons, the goals of public health and those of big tobacco are fundamentally incompatible.  Their relationship must be perpetually adversarial and unremittingly hostile.  How else could a responsible Government react to an industry that is responsible for the deaths of thousands of its citizens?<\/p><p>  Big tobacco is not and cannot be the Government's partner in any sort of enterprise.  Big tobacco has just one agenda: it wants to sell tobacco.  It is incredibly rich and terrifyingly powerful.  Its worldwide sales of 350 billion cigarettes translate into profits of &euro;35 billion.  It is not surprising that big tobacco does everything in its power to thwart the tobacco control policies of democratic Governments.  Historically, its weapons were the denial of health risks and spurious pseudo-research.  For many years, and in the face of a crushing weight of evidence, it absurdly contended that smoking does not cause cancer.  When an increasingly sophisticated population began to reject big tobacco's lies, it turned to more subtle weapons, including lobbying, legal intimidation and bribery.<\/p><p>  During Ireland's EU Presidency, the Minister for Health's innovative pan-European anti-smoking proposals were watered down following intense lobbying of parliamentarians.  <i>The New York Times<\/i> reported recently that American tobacco companies, cognisant of the fact that their traditional markets in western countries are continuing to shrink, are actively attempting to undermine efforts to introduce anti-smoking legislation in developing countries.  Uruguay and Namibia have found themselves facing multi-billion euro lawsuits and years of litigation.  The reach of big tobacco is such that it has managed to enlist some very strange allies.  The US Chamber of Commerce has campaigned against the Minister's plain packaging laws.  It is rumoured that officials from the US Government have expressed displeasure with the Minister's innovative proposal to introduce plain packaging.<\/p><p>  The World Health Organization of the United Nations has passed a directive to provide an appropriately transparent framework for the conduct of meetings between Governments and the industry in situations where such meetings are felt to be unavoidable.  Ireland is a signatory.  The directive strongly discourages such meetings, stating that there is a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the tobacco industry and those of public policy.  It stipulates that where interactions with the tobacco industry are necessary, they should be conducted transparently, preferably in public.  Ireland has signed up to this convention, but I fear that it has not always lived up to it.<\/p><p>  Senators will recall that the heads of the leading tobacco companies, as represented by the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee, managed to get a 45-minute private audience with the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Justice and Equality earlier this year.  I refer specifically to Steven Donaldson, Andrew Meagher and John Freda, who are the chiefs of PJ Carroll, John Player and Japan Tobacco International, respectively.  The Minister for Health wisely and correctly declined to attend.  I commend him for his wisdom in this regard.  This meeting was ostensibly an opportunity for these businessmen to inform the Government of their concerns regarding tobacco smuggling.  It was described by a spokesman for the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee as &quot;very positive&quot;.  Worryingly, it was reported that other matters were discussed, including the industry's opposition to the Minister for Health's proposals to tighten the anti-smoking regulations, for example by banning menthol roll-ups.  These issues, rather than the issue of smuggling, are the ones that are close to the industry's heart and constitute its real agenda.<\/p><p>  How did this meddling cartel of drug dealers get access to senior Fine Gael Ministers?  Which lobbyists could pull off a stunt like this?  The Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee's public relations activities are handled by Hall Communications and its anti-smuggling campaign is managed by O'Herlihy Communications, which was founded by Bill O'Herlihy.  Mr. O'Herlihy, who has extensive Fine Gael connections and who acted as public relations adviser to my personal hero in Irish politics, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, also attended this meeting.  In two years in Leinster House, I have succeeded in scheduling exactly one 20-minute formal meeting with the Minister for Health to discuss cancer research.  I tried to lobby the Minister for Finance to remove VAT from cancer-preventing sunblock in a rushed whispered conversation in the D&aacute;il Visitors' Gallery.  I would kill to get 45 minutes of facetime with the Taoiseach and other senior Ministers.<\/p><p>  Given that the Taoiseach and these Ministers are good men who would support tobacco control, how did this meeting happen?  The smuggling explanation just does not wash.  After all, the principal commercial victims of tobacco smuggling are retailers, not manufacturers.<\/p> <p>Smuggling does not hurt big tobacco.  Big tobacco likes and benefits from smuggling.  How does this happen?  In the majority of cases, the smuggled products are the companies' own products ultimately purchased at full price from them.  The purpose of smuggling is not to deny the companies their commercial profit but to deny the Exchequer tax revenue.  Furthermore, the availability of cheap cigarettes sold in an unregulated environment facilitates the recruitment of new under age child and teenage smokers.  I would go further.  If the Government genuinely thought this meeting was about smuggling, it was duped.  I believe this is what happened.  There was also likely a degree of social pressure, doing a good turn for a lobbyist who was a loyal party activist in his day.<\/p><p>This legislation, which directly translates into law an international agreement to which we signed up, would have the effect of clarifying any ambiguity over any contacts of this type.  It would eliminate the ambiguity which facilitated the Government meeting the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers' Advisory Committee.  It is simple and should be supported.  This Bill does not ban meetings.  That would be unconstitutional but the process is made transparent.  There must be two weeks' notice and the attendees must be known in advance.  The Minister for Health must nominate the chairperson of the meeting.  The agenda of the meeting must be published in advance.  Any deviation results in prosecution, which can result in fines and imprisonment.  How could anyone oppose this Bill?<\/p><p>In this context, what is the track record of this Government, which has a campaigning and committed anti-tobacco Minister for Health, in respect of anti-smoking legislation?  If this Bill is rejected, we will have a very strange league table for tobacco legislation in the lifetime of this Government by the end of 2013.  After nearly three years in office, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition will have had the opportunity to deal with four pieces of tobacco control legislation.  Two of these have been Private Members' Bills which I have introduced, one of which is today's Bill.  The other Bill would have banned smoking in cars with children and was supported by Senators van Turnhout and Daly.  I should mention that Senators Barrett and van Turnhout are my supporters and I am grateful to them for their support for today's Bill.  The other two Bills have been Government Bills, only one of which has been passed into law.  I understand how this has happened.  It has not been the Minister's wish.  I suspect he has done it through clenched teeth and with seething rage.  The only Bill that has been passed has been one that has made it easier to sell cheap tobacco to kids.  It was forced on us by the European authorities and the commercial authorities.  Shame on them for making us do this.<\/p><p>I completely support the Minister's other Bill, which would introduce mandatory plain packaging with explicit health warnings.  It is still working its way through the bureaucracy but it will not be law until 2014 at the earliest.  Let us take a minute to talk about the proposal on smoking in cars containing children.  That Bill was kindly agreed to by the Minister a year and a half ago and it is still terminally glued up in the bureaucracy.  For that reason, I and Senators Daly and van Turnhout will be advancing it again tomorrow on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>The Minister has the opportunity to cement Ireland's reputation as an innovative country in tobacco control.  The message from this Chamber will go out tonight because the forces of evil are looking at Ireland.  We have had spurious pseudo-libertarian and pseudo-civil rights groups setting up meetings in this country and pressure is mounting from all sides from the lobbying groups because they realise that if we bring in really draconian and restrictive legislation, others will follow our precedent.  I have a business card here.  The name on it is Cheryl Cullen, who is corporate affairs manager at JTI Ireland Limited whose headquarters are on the Old Belgard Road in Tallaght.  The phone number and e-mail address are available.  This was found in the Seanad Chamber.<\/p><p>I commend this Bill.  I earnestly implore the Minster to accept it.  We have been very careful in framing the Bill legally to ensure it is within our Constitution.  It is nothing we have not signed up to.  All it does is enforce regulation and transparency in an area where very dark - literally smoke-filled room - activities take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800037#OO00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387378800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  He is one of the most regular Ministers attending here.  We have all shared his dedication to the cause of preventing the damage tobacco does to society.  He wishes to make Ireland tobacco free by 2025 and launched his strategy document on that in October.<\/p><p>  The Bill before us incorporates a United Nations convention on tobacco control into Irish law.  I worry about lobbying but I worry about tobacco even more.  In the opinion of the Surgeon General in the US in 1964, &quot;cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action&quot;.  The Surgeon General's report of 1964 was endorsed in a 1992 court case because the tobacco industry had not lived up to what was expected after a Supreme Court judgement in 1964 and still sold the products in the intervening 28 years and did not disclose the evil that was in those products about which the Minister has told us in case anyone was naive enough to think they were smoking a plant that grew in their garden.  It was toxic, addictive and seriously damaging to people's health and that is why people in the US succeeded in court actions against tobacco companies for the damage they had done.<\/p><p>  What is public opinion on this issue?  The Minister enquired for us in chapter 6 of Tobacco Free Ireland, which was issued by the Department of Health in October 2013.  A total of 82% of people supported banning flavours that make tobacco products more attractive, 90% support the introduction of pictorial health warnings on tobacco products and 73% are in favour of introducing a fee on manufacturers to cover the health costs of tobacco.  If we are concerned about what our constituents might think about this activity, the Minister has answered those questions in the document.  A public health foundation study, entitled Public health foundations and the tobacco industry: lessons from Minnesota, stated that:<blockquote>It is not possible to avoid attacks by the tobacco industry or its political allies. Like programmes administered by government agencies, tobacco control foundations must be prepared for these attacks, including a proactive plan to educate the public about the principles of community based tobacco control.  Public health advocates also need to be willing to take prompt action to defend these programmes and hold public officials who attack tobacco control programmes accountable for their actions.<\/blockquote>There is a record of bribery in the US legislature.  One econometric study stated that Democrats who voted for less control on smoking were paid an average of $40,000.  Republicans were easier - they were paid an average of $20,000.  We know from the European example in the very recent past that serious lobbying took place at the European Parliament and delayed from September to October measures to control tobacco products.  Even then, they were watered down.  We have mass lobbying by tobacco companies as MEPs vote on anti-smoking legislation.  That was on 7 October.  Europe has a bad track record on tobacco, in particular lobbying by the Poles and Czechs to protect their indigenous tobacco industries.  As the Minister knows, the industry has gone to Third World countries to recruit new people, as campaigns by the Minister and Senator Crown persuade people in this part of this world not to smoke anymore.  Ireland aims to be tobacco free by 2025.  An article in <i>The Independent<\/i> on 8 October, entitled &quot;EU&rsquo;s 'shame' as it caves in to lobbying by tobacco giants over the sale and advertising of cigarettes&quot;, read:<blockquote>They also backed away from proposals to increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs to cover 75 per cent of the box &ndash; agreeing instead to the 65 per cent figure suggested by the industry.  The current requirement for health warnings is for 30 per cent minimum coverage on one side and 40 per cent on the other.  The moves will be seen as a victory for the tobacco industry, which has spent more than &euro;1m lobbying MEPs to reject the more stringent safety proposals agreed by European governments.  The differences must now be resolved before May 2014, when there are new MEP elections.  There will be intense lobbying in Europe ahead of the key vote.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p> This is a toxic and damaging product as the Minister has told us so eloquently on many occasions.  The tobacco industry engages in political lobbying.  The Government is concerned about all kinds of lobbying and this is welcome because it has been an unattractive feature of Irish politics.  I refer to the strange circumstances of the resignation of the Maltese Commissioner who was dealing with this area and it is rumoured that the tobacco industry lobbied against him.  The question of freedom of speech is an old refrain with regard to lobbying.  One cannot shout, \"Fire\" in a crowded theatre, so speech is curtailed.  We have to know what these firms are doing.  There is a very strong countervailing case to be made.  We should not give people access to Parliament to make their case without the opportunity to make a rebuttal.<\/p><p>The right of free speech is an individual right but these are corporate actors and they do not act as individuals.  They have engaged in this activity for 50 years since the report of the US Surgeon General exposed the damage done by tobacco.  It is not a normal product.  I ask the Minister to bear those factors in mind and to support Senator Crown's Bill.  This is an activity which seriously damages people.  The industry engages in serious lobbying and it is in the public interest that we should make a stand against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800038#PP00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387379400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

It is appropriate to examine the issue of lobbying.  The objective of the lobbying Bill is to introduce a register of lobbyists, to place on the register information on the identity of those communicating on specific policy, legislative matters or prospective decisions with designated public officials or officeholders in the public domain, as well as providing a framework for holding those engaged in lobbying accountable for the manner in which they conduct the activity.  This will allow the wider public to reach informed evidence-based judgment about the extent to which different interest groups are able to access and perhaps influence decision-making.  It will allow for a code of practice for lobbyists to be introduced and provide for restrictions and conditions to be placed on certain designated public officials and officeholders when taking up employment involving lobbying which may involve a conflict of interest with their previous public service role.  Head four of the Bill provides for the definition of lobbying and the exemptions to the regulatory requirements set out in the Bill.  It defines the communications which constitute lobbying and those that are excluded.  It provides that the register can issue guidelines on indirect lobbying.  It also determines that normal citizen interaction with public representatives in private and non-commercial capacities or micro-enterprises acting in a commercial capacity will not be included in the register unless the communication is in respect of land rezoning or development.

The Bill sets out the Government's policy on the regulation of lobbying.  It does not prevent lobbying but rather it provides clear guidelines for its management.  The Government's intention is clear.  The heads of the Bill have been published and there is a timeframe for dealing with the Bill.  The public service reform programme published on 17 November 2011 referred to the establishment of a statutory register of lobbyists.<\/p><p>Any legislation must be examined to ensure it is in accordance with the Constitution.  In my view, this Bill being debated today is not in accordance with the current constitutional position.  This is the reason I oppose the Bill.  I agree we need to debate the issue of tobacco use and also identify the extent and power of the tobacco lobby.  This week I was lobbied about the business of the health committee which will deal with this issue in the new year, including the proposal to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products.  Submissions will be accepted from those working in the health sector.  The committee has decided that the tobacco industry will be permitted to make a submission which will afford the committee members the opportunity to cross-examine the representatives of the industry.  This will highlight that the industry's arguments about the protection of jobs do not stand up in real terms when the overall cost to the State of cancer care is taken into account.  Senator Crown has correctly stated that the biggest contributing factor in cancer is tobacco smoking.  The Government has explained the long-term plan for dealing with the sale and distribution of tobacco products.  This Bill does not contribute to the long-term plan.  We need to be realistic that the tobacco industry is contributing to health problems in this country but we need to deal with it in a manner that does not present a constitutional challenge.  I do not believe this Bill will assist the programme for dealing with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800039#QQ01000","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1387379400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I applaud my friend and colleague, Senator Crown, on his initiative and on his continuing efforts to thwart the multifaceted efforts of the tobacco industry to deny that this is a health issue.  Senator Crown, who is working at the heart of this tragedy, referred to statistics.  I have some statistics of my own which I hope are complementary to his.  Fourteen people died yesterday because of smoking; another 14 will die today for the same reason.  Tomorrow, another 14 will die, and so it goes on.<\/p><p>This Bill strictly limits the possible interactions which may occur between public officials, any member of the Government, their employees or advisers and members of the tobacco industry, their professional agents or the people they fund.  Offences will be prosecuted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The directors of bodies corporate will be held accountable for the actions of their organisations.<\/p><p>The background to this Bill is the World Health Organization framework convention on tobacco control, the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO.  It was developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic.  Other factors such as global marketing, transnational tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and the international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes have also contributed to the explosive increase in tobacco use.<\/p> <p>The treaty, which is now closed for signature, had 168 signatories, including the European Community which makes it one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history.  The convention entered into force in February 2005, just 90 days after it had been acceded to, ratified, accepted or approved by 40 States, an unprecedented development in the history of the UN treaties.  It shows that the vast majority of countries want to do something serious about the tobacco epidemic.<\/p><p> In this country the tobacco industry cost the State &euro;1 billion more in health costs than the Exchequer collects in taxes annually.  I repeat, it costs the State &euro;1 billion more in health care costs than the Exchequer collects in taxes annually.  In Ireland the tobacco industry must attract 50 new smokers a day to replace those who die or quit.  Most of these are children who go on to be lifetime smokers and half of whom will later die from their addiction. <\/p><p> It is indisputable that there is a fundamental and reconcilable conflict between the tobacco industry's interests and public health policy interests.  The Irish Cancer Society tells us that the tobacco industry is trying everything it can to derail efforts designed to stop Irish people dying from smoking.  The tobacco industry has been so successful at marketing its product to young people here that children start smoking at a younger age than in any other country in Europe.<\/p><p> Five months after his meeting with big tobacco players, the Minister for Finance imposed a derisory 10 cent increase on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes.  However, in the same budget he made health insurance more expensive.  Increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective ways to encourage people to quit but it is unlikely that many smokers will consider a 10 cent increase to be a deterrent.  There must be concern that such a pathetic increase in tobacco tax was driven by big tobacco's argument that high prices lead to smuggling.  As Senator Crown pointed out, smuggling is not the result of high prices.  Some countries where legal cigarettes are low in price also have a very high smuggling rate.<\/p><p> What about the tobacco lobby itself?  Senator Barrett made reference to the voting and intensive efforts surrounding the vote on 8 October that came about as a result of the initiatives put forward by the Minister present, as President of Council, in the first half of this year.  An Irish official, on the Friday before the vote, briefed journalists on condition of anonymity.  He said:<blockquote>There is an unprecedentedly intense lobbying campaign from the industry going on inside the European Parliament with the express intention of trying to frustrate this legislation.  This is completely on a scale way beyond lobbying that normally goes on.<\/blockquote>He said officials had been surprised to discover that cigarette manufacturers and their lobbyists had knowledge of precise elements of the law barely 24 hours after they were agreed behind closed doors.  He continued: &quot;The level of lobbying at the moment exceeds any campaign that has gone on in the parliament in recent years&quot;.  The aim of the legislation is to combat smoking among the young and cut down on the estimated 700,000 EU citizens who die of tobacco-related causes each year.  In an unusual move, of which the Minister was part of, a joint statement was issued on the same Friday that urged the European Parliament to begin negotiating with EU governments on the legislation as quickly as possible in order to finalise the law by the end of the year.  <\/p><p> I shall give an indication of just how strong and powerful the tobacco lobby is in the United Stated.  In 2010, which is the last year I could find figures for, the tobacco industry spent a whopping $16.6 million on lobbyists to represent the industry to Congress.  In Alberta, more than 20 people, including several former government staffers, are registered in the Province of Alberta as official lobbyists for tobacco companies or affiliated organisations.  At least half of the registrations have been made within the past ten months after the US Government announced that it was working on new legislation.<\/p><p> In the US, the tobacco industry's success at winning from Congress what it wanted while still providing law makers with an opportunity to appear to be all in favour of health was a brilliant stroke.  The industry brought it off because the tobacco lobby employed an unusually skilled and well-organised strategy; because it hired some of the best legal brains and best-connected people in Washington to help with the fight; and because it successfully grafted onto its built-in congressional strength from tobacco-producing states a sufficient number of congressmen to whom the issue was not surprisingly one of health, or even of the tobacco industry, but one of curbing the powers of regulatory agencies.  In other words, they decided to go after big government and to forget about all the people who are dying as a result of smoking.  They managed to succeed in throwing a heavy smokescreen around the health issue.<\/p><p> If ever there was a need to ensure accountability and transparency in the relationship, that inevitably arises between any outside body and government, it has to be the one between the insidious tobacco industry and Government at the highest level in this country.  It is for that reason I applaud and, on behalf of my party, commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800039#QQ01100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387380000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Nobody here can deny or argue with the fact that the Minister for Health has done more to restrict and temporarily restrict tobacco products than any of his predecessors.  All of the combined efforts by his predecessors do not amount to the amount he has achieved in the area.<\/p><p>The Bill attempts to address an issue that nobody here can have difficulty with, that is ways to reduce or eliminate the harmful effects of tobacco.  As Members have said here during a previous debate, the tobacco industry is the only industry that is required to find new customers because it kills half of its old customers.  That is a striking comment to make.  <\/p><p>As legislators we must examine the Bill and we are confined to doing so.  Senator Crown has eloquently outlined the harms and dangers associated with tobacco products which I agree with and acknowledge.  However, we are still constrained to dealing with the legislation that is directly before us.  <\/p><p>I have difficulty in accepting the Private Members' Bill.  I hope that Senator Crown does not mind me saying that the Bill has been constructed in a way that I find unacceptable.  I shall talk about that in detail in a moment.  <\/p><p>The Bill seeks to codify in Irish law the requirements of the United Nations framework convention on tobacco control.  I have read the Bill in great detail.  One section recognises the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts.  Section 10 deals with tobacco advertising and promotion.  Apart from this I cannot see how the Bill relates to anything contained in the 45-page tobacco control framework or codifies it into Irish law.  There are elements of the Bill that work around certain parts of the tobacco control framework but they do not address, in the Bill, what it purports to do.  <\/p><p>Let us examine the legislation in a little more detail.  In section 1, the interpretation section, the definition of an official is clearly laid out which is right that it should be.  However, section 2(1) to (5), inclusive, seem to add a level of ambiguity by referring to &quot;a person&quot;.  They do not distinguish whether the official referred to in the interpretation is the person referred to in section 2.  This is a technical matter.  We are legislators and it is necessary to deal with the legislation that is before us.  That is the first part of the Bill that I found confusing.  <\/p><p>Section 2(3), (4) and (5) use the words &quot;present at a meeting&quot;.  At first glance that seems an uncontroversial statement but no interpretation has been offered on what the phrase means.  We all know of precedence and that present at a meeting can mean active participation or just in attendance.  The phrase has a different interpretation according to other standing orders, rules and laws.  I have given two examples of how the construction of the Bill has failed to be clear.   <\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the power of the tobacco industry and how quickly it lights on ambiguity in the law to give itself a day in court.  Even if it loses it hardly matters because its resources are such that it is viewed as another way of promoting its product.<\/p> <p>Subsections 2(1) to (9) lay out the offences within the Bill, yet subsection 2(12) states: \"A person guilty of an offence under this act shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;30,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months,\".  There is a difficulty in that subsection because, for example, a junior clerk who takes minutes at the meeting incurs the same penalty as a senior official who deliberately goes about subverting the provisions of the Bill.  That cannot by any means be accepted in a Bill. <\/p><p>The construction of the Bill precludes my support.  I spent most of today in contact with my party members to find a way to support this Bill if its construction allowed us do so.  Senator Burke pointed out its possible unconstitutionality.  That is a problem.  All things considered, I support the thrust of the Bill.  At the risk of being too colloquial, it is over-egging it a bit to say that it is trying to codify in Irish law the provisions of the framework because I cannot see instances where the sections relate to Irish law.  Control of lobbying must be welcomed and lauded but the provisions of this Bill preclude me and the Labour Party from supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800040#RR00200","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387380600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome his commitment to this issue, in particular his aim to make Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  A few weeks ago, the Minister said that we have a duty to our children and that the tobacco industry was terrified by the move to plain packaging because it knows that it will make an impact.  I support the Bill that Senators Crown and Barrett have put forward because it involves a principle.  Over the past few days in this House we discussed a Bill that had been through the D&aacute;il but to which the Government tabled numerous amendments.  The idea that we cannot allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage is highly questionable.  This is a matter of our voting on a principle.  I can pick up any Bill and show where I have difficulties.  This is a clear principle.<\/p><p>  Ireland ratified, and was a party to, the World Health Organization, WHO, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  I refer to the guidelines for implementation produced by the WHO, according to which the framework convention recognises that parties, of which Ireland is one, &ldquo;need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be informed of activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts&rdquo;.  If Members of this House or the other House, or officials, have meetings behind closed doors there is no way that people can be informed of the activities of the tobacco industry.  <\/p><p>  Under Article 5.3 of the convention, &ldquo;in setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law&rdquo;.  That is what we are trying to do with this Bill, namely, to ensure that it is in our national law.  We have ratified the framework convention and have been told to limit interactions with the tobacco industry to the extent strictly necessary to regulate the industry and tobacco products effectively.  Any of these interactions need to be as public and transparent as possible.<\/p><p>  We are all very aware of the reach and influence of the tobacco industry.  Anyone who is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children knows the type of organisations, individuals and companies from which we have received correspondence.  It takes very little research to discover the funding behind them from the tobacco industry.  The front of house might look quite clean and respectable but with very little probing one can see the industry&rsquo;s insidious funding.<\/p><p>  Suzanne Lynch wrote recently in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> about how fans of the cult TV series &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo;, which shows the murky world of tobacco lobbying, are familiar with Don Draper and his team of advertising executives who make their way in the cut-throat world of 1960s advertising and are bolstered by the patronage of their top tobacco client.  When one watches that series one realises that the hard-drinking culture and casual sexism of the 1960s have all gone but the practice of tobacco lobbying is alive and well.  We have not made a dint in it.  The reason behind this legislation is to send out a clear message that we will not accept tobacco lobbying.<\/p><p>  Senator Mooney spoke about the EU regulations that were being discussed.  The Minister was on the other side of the debate and defended it too.  Documents obtained by <i>The Observer<\/i> show that Philip Morris International employed 161 people to combat the EU tobacco products directive and spent &euro;1.25 million lobbying, with lunches, dinners, etc., to influence Members of the European Parliament.  It was one of the darkest days of tobacco lobbying.  It is insidious and we need to ensure that we have a clear framework. <\/p><p>  This could be done through ethics legislation.  I was very surprised when I became a Member of this House that I did not receive a clear outline of the fact that we have signed up to, and ratified, the WHO convention.  The obligation is on us as parliamentarians to implement it.  Is it clearly outlined in the books given to Ministers when they are appointed?  We need to ensure that there are no meetings behind closed doors.  Oireachtas Members have told me that they have received representations directly from the tobacco industry and some have had meetings with it.  Is that okay?  I believe that goes against the framework convention.  How are they to know that, unless we put it into law and make it absolutely clear so that we all know this industry is insidious?<\/p><p>  We are trying to work on public health issues.  We do not need the heavily financed, insidious tobacco industry interfering in our work on behalf of the people of Ireland, and particularly targeting children and damaging children&rsquo;s health.  People start smoking here at an earlier age than anywhere else in Europe.  The Minister is driving a measure through to introduce plain packaging.  The tobacco industry at EU level is focusing on Ireland.  It will put all its resources in here because it needs to block this move.  If it succeeds here the measure will not filter through to the whole of the EU.  We are the focus of huge might and power.  I could find ways to change or amend this Bill.  That is what Committee Stage is for.  We should vote tonight on the principle and I ask Members to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800041#SS00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387380600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Crown for raising this issue.  I am always thankful for any opportunity to talk about tobacco and the harm that it causes in our society.  I specifically thank Senator Crown for all the work he does on the protection of public health from the harms of tobacco.  He is a strong advocate for the elimination of smoking related diseases and deaths in this country.  He does, after all, spend most of his professional life dealing with the consequences of tobacco smoking.  He has been a public and strong voice against the tobacco industry and its influence on our health and our policies.<\/p><p>I recognise and acknowledge the principles behind this Bill.  The World Health Organization has indicated something we already know - that there is a large body of evidence demonstrating that the tobacco industry uses a wide range of tactics to interfere with tobacco control. <\/p> <p>These tactics include direct and indirect political lobbying, which is the topic of the Private Members' Bill today.<\/p><p>I have experienced at first hand the intense tobacco industry lobbying in Europe to which Senator van Turnout alludes, most particularly during Ireland's recent EU Presidency.  The revision of the tobacco products directive was the main health related priority for Ireland during our Presidency, and I am very proud of the great progress we made while chairing the negotiations.  I agree with Senator van Turnhout about Philip Morris and its 161 lobbyists for 700 MEPs, and that is before one counts the lobbyists that British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco put into the field.<\/p><p>Tobacco lobbying made our task very difficult, but none the less I am delighted to hear that agreement has been reached on the revised directive.  I put on record my congratulations to all those involved, particularly the European Parliament, the Commission and the Lithuanian Presidency.  I must make specific mention of Commissioner Tonio Borg, who has worked tirelessly on progressing this directive since his appointment.  While I understand that compromises had to be made, the directive is important legislation in the task of protecting people from the harm of tobacco.  It was agreed despite the heavy lobbying of the tobacco industry.  The announcement of the agreement this morning has made this a very good day for the future health of our children and is probably the best Christmas present we could ever give them.  Having just come into the job, Commissioner Borg found himself subject to lobbying by me, because I was deeply concerned that the previous Commissioner had been unseated in a manner which left many question marks, fear and a sense that the tobacco industry might be at work behind the scenes.<\/p><p>Let us look at some of the other tactics the tobacco industry uses.  A report published by the World Health Organization describes in detail the methods used by the industry to &quot;block, nullify, modify or delay pending legislation&quot;.  These strategies include the following: subverting the legislation and exploiting legislative loopholes; challenging and stretching Government timetables for implementing laws; attempting to bribe legislators, as Senator Barrett mentioned; gaining favour by financing Government initiatives on other health issues; shaping opinion by manipulating the media and the public; undermining public confidence on the validity of research showing the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke; and defending trade benefits at the expense of health.  Well beyond that, the industry uses delaying tactics by incorporating thousands of individuals to lodge complaints and objections, which ties up departments and the relevant legislatures in answering all of these.  Every year the industry delays the directive and delays our initiatives, it makes a few billion more.  As has been pointed out, whatever we take in taxes from that industry costs us much more in terms of what we have to spend on health, but the real cost is to the health and well-being of our people.<\/p><p>Senator Crown raised the issue of letters from other jurisdictions and their public representatives.  I have seen those letters.  Let me reiterate the comments I made at the health committee some weeks back.  This nation determines its future.  Our people - us - and no one else, will determine our policy.  We will not be intimidated and I can guarantee that this Minister will not be intimidated by the tobacco industry or any of its agents, elected or otherwise.  We must protect our children.<\/p><p>I have been asked not to call the tobacco industry &quot;evil&quot; but how else can I describe an industry that seeks to entrap our children and to have them addicted before they reach the age of 18 so they cannot make the decision which they surely would make otherwise?  Research shows that one in every two children who try smoking take it up, and one in every two of those who smoke regularly die prematurely - at least ten years early on average - from a tobacco related illness.  That is the death sentence from which we are trying to protect our children.  I have made it clear that stamping out smoking is an issue close to my heart.  I have said many times that my priority, while not forgetting current smokers, is to prevent children from starting to smoke.  It is damning, in my view, that a European study shows that, as was pointed out, Ireland has the lowest age of children starting to smoke among all the EU member states.  Despite this, thankfully, the prevalence of children smoking is falling.  The majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years. Almost four out of every five - 78% - started to smoke before the age of 18 years.  It is clear it is children the industry is recruiting to replace the smokers who have died or quit.<\/p><p>In October this year, I launched Ireland's latest policy on smoking, Tobacco Free Ireland.  It is the first policy document to be launched under the Healthy Ireland framework.  Lifestyle trends and inequalities in health outcomes are leading us towards a dangerously unhealthy and unaffordable future.  Healthy Ireland is a Government framework which sets out a vision that will improve the health and well-being of all the population of Ireland over the next 12 years.  It puts forward a whole-of-society approach and outlines new arrangements to ensure more effective co-operation to achieve better outcomes for all.  There is a new HSE directorate on health and well-being.  As I continually point out, prevention is better than cure.  I often feel I am the Minister for ill health because all we ever talk about is disease instead of prevention.  We must stop paying lip service to prevention and pay for it.<\/p><p>The main aim of Tobacco Free Ireland is to make Ireland tobacco free, that is, to have a smoking rate of less than 5% of the population by 2025.  The strategy targets the protection of children in particular and the denormalisation of smoking.  Everybody in this country finds is extraordinary when we are abroad to see people smoking in a restaurant, a pub or an office.  Tobacco Free Ireland builds on many successful past initiatives.  The ground-breaking workplace smoking ban in 2004 had a huge impact and many other worthwhile, and effective measures have been introduced in recent years, including the graphic images on packs.  Most recently, Government approval has been received for the publication of the general scheme of a new public health (standardised packaging of tobacco) Bill 2013 and to proceed with the drafting of the legislation.  I am convinced this legislation will make a significant contribution to our efforts to reduce tobacco consumption.<\/p><p>The strongly negative reaction of the industry to our proposals has only confirmed my views.  This industry invests vast sums of money in developing its packaging based on market research.  We have seen the advertisements on television, where young children are playing with nice shiny cigarette packets that make them feel good and look nice.  The Irish Cancer Society repeated that study and demonstrated the same effect, and then produced the new plain packages.  I had meant to bring some with me but had to race from a meeting to be here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800041#SS00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387381200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The Minister had them during the previous debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800042#TT00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1387381200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>They recoil at the sight of the gangrenous foot or the wasted man who is dying from lung cancer, and they ask why anyone would ever smoke.  That is the difference between reality and advertising.  Advertising seeks to ensnare and entrap our children.  The reality, our children are wise enough to know, is something to be avoided.<\/p><p>The industry argues that the main reason it opposes standardised packaging is that packs will be easier to counterfeit and illicit trade will increase.  My colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners have poured cold water on this, stating that the tax stamp is the key way to determine whether something is legal or illegal.  Let us think about this.  If plain packs are used in this country and other countries are still producing shiny packs, it would be very easy to spot what is contraband.  In any event, 90% of contraband is through illegal imports and only 10% is counterfeit.  There is a theory the industry is afraid of standardised packaging because there will be no perceived difference between their premium, more expensive brands and their cheaper brands.  As a result, their profits will reduce.<\/p><p>While a legal challenge to the proposed legislation cannot be ruled out, and in fact I would be astonished if there was not a legal challenge, I am confident the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and is a proportionate and justified measure.  It would be an extraordinary society that would put the intellectual property rights of the tobacco industry, whose product kills one in two of those who use it regularly, above the lives and well-being of our citizens, in particular our children.<\/p> <p> I am determined that the threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  It is one of several methods the tobacco industry has used to stymie and intimidate authorities in other jurisdictions.  It has been said to me by counterparts in other countries that they are holding on to see how we get on with these provisions in Ireland.  I am pleased that Britain and New Zealand are now moving in the same direction.  There are always obstacles - legal, lobbying or otherwise - to any move for change, but we must do what is right, not what is easiest.  There is a case to be made for asking all public relations companies to confirm whether their client lists include tobacco companies.  In fact, I am issuing an open call from this House to that effect, a call to which I see Senators assent.<\/p><p> We need to remind ourselves why we are debating any issues relating to tobacco.  It is because tobacco use is one of the most preventable public health threats, with almost 6 million people dying globally from smoking each year.  On a human level, that amounts to 6 million lives needlessly cut short and 6 million families destroyed.  On an economic level, it accounts for a substantial section of the health care budget which might be saved or redirected to other areas in need of funding.  Governments must take strong action to tackle this global problem.<\/p><p> This Government has ambitious plans and a strong appetite for radical and far-reaching tobacco control measures.  However, we cannot support the proposals we are discussing today, for the reasons I will outline.  Ireland is a strong supporter of and a party to the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  The convention recognises the issue of tobacco industry interference in Article 5.3:<blockquote>In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law.<\/blockquote>To assist countries in implementing this article, the WHO developed guidelines that are comprehensive in nature and set out recommendations on steps to be taken if and when there is interaction with the tobacco industry.  The guidelines allow interaction with the industry by governments &quot;when and to the extent strictly necessary to enable them to effectively regulate the tobacco industry and tobacco products.&quot;  In these circumstances, the WHO recommends, interactions should be conducted publicly where possible and with disclosure of all relevant records.  In 2012 and 2013, I wrote to all Ministers and separately to the Secretaries General of their Departments enclosing the guidelines and requesting adherence thereto in respect of any interactions with the tobacco industry.<\/p><p> Regarding the meeting to which Senator Crown alluded, the minutes of that meeting are already in the public domain through the freedom of information process and are open to any journalist or anybody else who wishes to see them.  Within a couple of weeks of that meeting, the Government of which I am proud to be part offered me unanimous backing to bring in standardised packaging.  That was noted around the world and by the tobacco companies in particular.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach joined me in writing a letter to MEPs seeking their support for the tobacco directive.  This Government is 100% committed to creating a tobacco-free Ireland, protecting our children from tobacco and helping smokers quit their habit.  We are not anti-smokers; we are anti-smoking.<\/p><p> One of the recommendations in our Tobacco Free Ireland policy document specifically addresses this area:<blockquote>Take steps to ensure that all government officials, employees of state agencies and members of any government branch (executive, legislative and judiciary) responsible for setting and implementing tobacco control policies and for protecting those policies against tobacco industry interests are aware of their obligations under Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC and are aware of the Guidelines developed to assist in meeting these obligations.<\/blockquote>In order to implement this recommendation, I am exploring further options on how best to protect public health policy on tobacco from lobbyists.<\/p><p> A number of legal and constitutional considerations arise in respect of Senator Crown's proposals.  The constitutional issues include serious concerns in regard to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.  Neither I nor my officials are aware of any free world jurisdiction in which criminal offences such as those envisaged in this Bill apply.  There are freedoms enshrined in our Constitution which make it unconstitutional for us to implement the Bill.  There are also problems of vagueness in respect of the criminal provisions contained therein, which make them likely to be challenged successfully.  The offences provisions are, in the view of the Attorney General, unworkable.<\/p><p> I am anxious that Senator Crown and those who support his proposals in this Bill do not misunderstand my position.  We are on the same page when it comes to the scourge of tobacco.  Indeed, we are leading the charge in Europe in regard to standardised packaging, a provision which I fully expect to be challenged on the grounds of interference with intellectual property rights.  As we know, our Constitution is very strong on property rights.  Our defence, as the tobacco industry knows, will be that this is a proportionate measure to protect public health.  All of the research supports that and any reasonable-minded person will consider it such.  On the other hand, introducing legislation such as the Senator has proposed would be very disproportionate and might only serve to undermine our efforts in this area.  To criminalise meetings with representatives of the tobacco industry would be untenable.  Smoking is not illegal in this country and the tobacco industry is not outlawed, although some people might be of the view that both should be the case.  As it stands, we have a Constitution and people have rights under that Constitution.<\/p><p> The Bill also cites An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as the enforcers of this legislation.  It is likely that these provisions would prove unenforceable on a practical level, which would have the effect of taking from the credibility of the principles behind the legislation.  Such an enforcement obligation might also be considered an ineffective use of Garda resources.  While adherence to the previously mentioned guidelines is important, I reiterate that the manufacture and sale of tobacco are not illegal activities.  To criminalise persons for engaging with the industry would therefore be excessive and disproportionate, particularly when to do so might damage the credibility of other key policies and legislative tobacco control measures.<\/p><p> The Bill is unnecessary given that the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and rules concerning the practice of lobbying.  The public service reform programme launched by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 17 November 2011 contains a commitment to prepare legislation to meet this objective.  On 30 April this year, the Government approved the drafting of the regulation of lobbying Bill, the purpose of which is to ensure greater openness and transparency on public policy formulation and facilitate valuable input to the decision-making process.  The intention is to continue to encourage such participation while ensuring it is done in a fully open manner.<\/p><p> I conclude by reiterating my appreciation of the work Senator Crown has done in bringing forward this legislation and his bona fides in terms of what he is seeking to achieve.  His proposals, however, are very problematic.  As I said, the regulation of lobbying Bill will assist in the issue he seeks to address.  I certainly am not complacent in this matter and will continue to explore actions we can take in line with our Tobacco Free Ireland policy.  However, to legislate as set out in this Private Members' Bill would be unnecessary and inappropriate.  For all of the reasons I have outlined, the Government cannot support the legislation.  I thank the Senator once again for raising this issue on the floor of the House.  The more light we throw on these matters the better.  The tobacco industry promotes, advertises and sells a product that kills one in two of those who become addicted to it.  That amounts to 5,200 Irish people and 700,000 Europeans every single year.  I am determined that we will succeed in tackling this scourge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800042#TT00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387381800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I very much hope this Bill will pass Second Stage.  I recall that Senator Burke brought forward a Bill relating to medical insurance which was acceptable almost in its entirety to the Government.  I argued on that occasion that it should be allowed to go through Second Stage, after which the Minister could amend it as required.<\/p> <p>I recall thinking on that occasion that the Government should let it pass Second Stage and then amend it.  That is the way this Parliament should work.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that this is a savage Bill.  However, we are dealing with a savage and unscrupulous conspiracy.  The Minister, on the first page of his speech, puts forward seven accusations against the industry.  They amount to a statement of criminal conspiracy.  It is a criminal conspiracy to kill people for profit.  This is not about the freedom of the individual or curtailing the rights of citizens, but curtailing the licence of multinational corporations which do not have the welfare of the Irish people or anybody else at heart.  The motivation is money.<\/p><p>Let us consider the question of the Constitution.  I noted that Senator Colm Burke scrupulously avoided my challenge to him to offer constitutional reasons, in probably the weakest speech he has made because he is always very good.  The Minister gave them, but they are quite vague.  They include freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association, but we must have more than that.  We must see the Attorney General's advice, although attorneys general can be wrong.  The over-riding principle of the Constitution is the public good.  I cannot quote the exact Article, but it is in the Constitution.  I am astonished that no Government has ever found the guts to use it, because I believe it would persuade a court.<\/p><p>There are organisations such as Forest &Eacute;ireann, which always claims it is not paid by anybody but I do not know whether I can accept that, and there is a great deal of bland blather, like the rubbish that is spouted by Drinkaware about drinking responsibly.  How does one smoke responsibly?  Does one just not inhale, like President Clinton?  I started smoking when I was in short trousers and my age was a single figure.  The reason I did it was that it was so bloody glamorous.  Everybody did it.  Marlene Dietrich and Audrey Hepburn smoked, marvellously glamorous women with their long cigarette holders, as well as all those wonderful masculine hunks, including the Marlboro Man.  What the industry did not tell us about the Marlboro Man was that he died a skeletal ruin from the products he advertised.<\/p><p>Not only was it glamorous when I started smoking, but the medical professionals did not know much about it.  Some of them actually recommended it to relax people who were nervous.  I remember that.  The tobacco companies bought and suppressed scientific information and did everything they could to suppress the evidence that smoking was not just addictive, but also lethal.  The lobbying in the US is an absolute affront to democracy.  Votes were for sale.  Other colleagues have said that, but I consider it deeply offensive.  The targeting of young people is also deeply offensive.  However, at least they have people such as Professor Crown and this Minister, who I believe are singing from the same page, to support them.  The Minister should be prepared to let this Bill pass Second Stage, let the industry challenge it and use the public good provision in the Constitution.<\/p><p>There are also the lies about smuggling.  Some of the tobacco companies were convicted in New York state of being involved in a conspiracy with the smugglers.  I received a glossy document which mentioned nothing about the smoking industry or the tobacco companies, but I found out eventually, after some digging, that it was from those companies.  It was circulated to every Member of the House.  This type of thing is absolutely disingenuous.  They are vengeful people.  In America, they deliberately protracted legal cases so the unfortunate people who were suing them would die of the disease which they had caused during the trial.  Every rotten, dirty, bullying trick has been used by this international conspiracy.  There is the targeting of young people, lies about smuggling and the dumping in Africa and other countries, where people do not have access to the information we have.<\/p><p>In America, one comedian, Bob Newhart, was able to make a laugh of it.  I do not know if Members of the House will remember it.  The comedian rang up Sir Walter Raleigh and said, &quot;Hello, Walt, what is new?&quot;  Walter says, &quot;I have got this great new stuff.&quot;  The comedian continues, &quot;It is what, Walt?  Leaves?  You roll it up in a tube and you what, Walt?  Then you put it in your mouth and what?  You light it and inhale the smoke.&quot;  The comedian bursts out laughing.  It is a completely mad thing to do.<\/p><p>Senator Gilroy made some interesting points.  An official is a person, but a person is not necessarily an official.  That must be taken into account when referring to persons who were present at a meeting.  I said it is a savage Bill, but one must be savage with these beasts because they are savages.  With regard to the &euro;30,000 fine or imprisonment for six months, nobody in their right mind thinks that a judge would impose that on a secretary.  There is still judicial room for manoeuvre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800043#UU00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387382400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Norris that one must be savage when one is dealing with these people.

He is a pioneering Minister who is determined to make a tangible difference.  We will see that in 2014 with the plain packaging which shows the awful results of smoking cigarettes.  Obviously, every Member of the House is singing from the same hymn sheet.  We might have different ways of singing, but we are using the same sheet.  I hope there will not be a division on this issue.  Smoking is a political issue, but it is not and should not be a party political issue.  We have a responsibility to the next generation to ensure that we do the right thing.  Any fair-minded person would acknowledge that the Minister, when he chaired the Council of Ministers for Health and over the last two years, has taken significant steps to deal with these cigarette companies and the curse of smoking in our society.

I recall the publicans saying on the television, \"We run Ireland.  The meetings are held in our establishments.  We say what happens.\"  Thankfully, Deputy Martin had the courage of his convictions to stand up to that and lead the way.  Many countries in Europe followed by imposing a ban on smoking, and rightly so.  In fact, if I had my way, there would be no place on the campus of Leinster House where people could smoke.  If they wish to smoke, let them go outside the gate.  I have no hesitation about saying that.  Smoking should be banned on the campuses of all hospitals, inside or outside, and it should also be banned on all university campuses.  If one goes in the main gate, whether the university is open or closed, it should be banned.<\/p> <p> It breaks my heart to see adults who are over 18 years of age, but who would still be considered young people, buying and smoking cigarettes knowing the consequences.  Whatever about when Senator Norris was a young fellow and people did not know the consequences, most intelligent young people who get 400 or 500 points to go to college now know the consequences.  I do not know how we can deal with this situation.  Perhaps we need the Youth Defence shock jock approach and show images of the effects of cigarettes in primary schools.  It will be tough medicine, but it will be for young people's own good.<\/p><p>In our small shop in County Clare, the cigarette companies have employed insidious efforts to try to peddle their dangerous wares.  For example, they introduced 23-cigarette packs for &euro;9.99.  The implicit meaning is that the unit cost per cigarette is less than it would be for a 20-cigarette pack.  This is appalling.  They now have 25-cigarette packs.  Behind retailers' backs, they offer shop staff gift vouchers if they can increase sales of particular brands by certain percentages.  Unfortunately, retail is under such pressure that many people do not have the courage of their convictions.  Thankfully, some do.  Perhaps my determination on this issue is becoming known.  I have received veiled threats from third parties because I have not hesitated in saying that smoking should be illegal.  I buy into the principle of a smoke-free Ireland by 2025.<\/p><p>I have suggested to colleagues that the Seanad should set up an all-party committee to consider ways to reduce smoking, similar to the direct provision committee set up by Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and van Turnhout and others.  The House's passion will inform and assist the Minister in his campaign.  Perhaps people are not interested in my idea, but I hope they will be.  My office would facilitate the establishment and administration of such a committee if people felt it was a worthwhile endeavour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800044#VV00400","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387383000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I wish to share two minutes with Senator Healy Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800045#WW00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1387383000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It echoes another era.  It reads:<blockquote>A number of legal and constitutional considerations arise in respect of Senator Crown's proposals.

Let the strong lobby contest it in the courts.  It is the best publicity that we could get for what is one of the most serious matters.  We held a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  Why not have a referendum on people's lives, particularly those of the young generation, so that we might save them and give them a future?  Why are we afraid to be to the fore as legislators?  This Bill gives us an opportunity to release ourselves from the shackles of hypocrisy and cosmetic caution.

The Minister is welcome and I am delighted to hear of his ambition to make Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.  It is laudable, but unrealistic unless we do much more.  For example, Ireland does not even have a university campus that is smoke free.  As the Minister will recall, I wrote to him during Ireland's European Presidency.  Compared with America, Europe has no smoke-free campuses.<\/p><p>While the Minister's intention is good, I support the Bill for two reasons.  First, smoking kills.  Second, the Bill gets to the root of the problem.  For that, I commend Senator Crown.  The 2007 Sl&aacute;n survey showed that smoking was related to 40 diseases.  According to the 2008 CSO statistics, 5,200 people die of smoking-related diseases per year.  This is 100 people per week.  These are epidemic proportions.<\/p><p>I have a particular interest in this issue.  In the mid-1990s, I was seconded to Mary Immaculate College in Limerick and the Mid-Western Health Board to design a programme, what is now known as social, personal and health education, SPHE, as a subject for primary and secondary schools with a team of others. One of the programme's components was smoking cessation and education.  When we wrote the programme, it was called B&iacute; Foll&aacute;in, which means &quot;Fulfil your health potential&quot;.  In the course of the work, I learned that smoking thrived on and addicted the poorest, youngest, least educated and weakest.  Smoking is a gateway, and illicit, drug for children aged between nine and 13 years.  These are primary school pupils.  Young girls find it particularly difficult to stop.  As Senator Norris stated, there is also peer pressure to be seen as cool.  We had to work hard on the question of how to make smoking unattractive to people when they felt good and believed they looked good.<\/p> <p>Bad breath had one of the biggest effects on young girls.  We also considered the fact that one neat drop of nicotine killed a bird instantly.<\/p><p>In 2000, I visited Romania where the tobacco industry sells cigarettes at low prices to get people addicted.  The same approach was used in South America.<\/p><p>I am asking the Minister to let this legislation go through to Committee Stage and, as Senator van Turnhout said, accept the Bill in principle.  Let us amend it and make it constitutionally acceptable on Committee Stage, but the Minister should not stop the Bill.  Smoking kills so let us not play politics here.

Like the Minister, I wish to acknowledge the major contribution that Senator Crown is making to the protection of public health by highlighting the dangerous impact of smoking on the lives of so many people in this country.  I also commend the Minister for his proactive approach and his ambitious plan to have the country smoke-free by 2025.<\/p><p>Some years ago, the smoking ban in public places was successfully steered through the Oireachtas by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Martin.  When that ban was mooted, people said it could not be done and would not be accepted.  However, there is now a growing awareness of the harm being caused to so many people by the tobacco industry. <\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames said that over 5,000 people per annum are losing their lives due to tobacco-related illnesses.  In addition, the financial impact on the health service is enormous.  Although it is difficult to quantify, it must run into several billions of euro per annum.  That money could be used to the benefit of many sections of our society if it was available.<\/p><p>In the first place, the matter should be brought to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that, with immediate effect in the new year, smoking on the Leinster House campus should be totally outlawed.  That would send out a clear message that those who work here, both legislators and staff, are anti-smoking and wish to do something practical about it.  Such a decision would send out a significant signal.  <\/p><p>As other speakers have said, any educational campuses around the country that are not yet smoke-free should be encouraged to become so.  The management and student unions in those educational institutions should take on board what we are attempting to do here in making Ireland smoke-free by 2025.<\/p><p>I can understand and appreciate that the Minister has a difficulty if he has been advised that the Bill is possibly unconstitutional.  I have no doubt, however, that in time we can ensure that the Bill will be constitutional and will therefore contribute significantly to what Senator Crown and all other Members of this House want to achieve, which is a smoke-free Ireland by 2025.<\/p><p>Close friends and relatives of mine have gone to their eternal reward much younger than they should have as a result of tobacco abuse.  I am concerned, however, that if we eliminate tobacco totally, hard drugs will replace it.  We must also deal with the appalling abuse of alcohol in this country.  I hope that over the Christmas period people will be responsible in this regard.  We are facing many health challenges, including the abuse of substances both legal and illegal.<\/p><p>As has been rightly said, we have legalised drug taking in this country in the form of tobacco usage.  The sooner we grasp this particular nettle the better.  I commend Senator Crown for bringing this Bill before the House.  He should not be disheartened if the Bill is not accepted, but should continue to do that good work.  He has the support of every Member of this House in wanting the Minister to ban smoking by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800046#XX00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1387383600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Crown for bringing this Bill before us and using Private Members' time to raise again the issue of smoking and the tobacco industry generally.  He has been a pioneer in this area since his election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to the House.  On the Order of Business in recent months, much has been said - not all of it good - about his performance as Minister for Health.  On this issue especially, however, we must acknowledge his pioneering work and thank him for it.  Tackling smoking is an important issue, as is reducing alcohol consumption.  We all support the tobacco control issue and any measures the Minister can take to reduce smoking will be supported by Sinn F&eacute;in and, I believe, all Senators in the House.  I thank the Minister for his work in this area.<\/p><p>I support the intent of the Bill which attempts to expose and combat the lavishly funded lobbying of public representatives and officials by the tobacco industry.  As previous speakers have said, the tobacco industry is responsible for widespread misery in terms of damage to people's health from smoking.  Much has been done in recent years in this area, including advertising restrictions and the smoking ban in public premises, which was introduced by the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Martin.  In addition, there is now a greater public awareness of and social responsibility concerning smoking.<\/p><p>However, to use that phrase &quot;A lot done, more to do&quot;, I think we do have much more to do in this respect.  Every year, smoking places huge additional costs on our health services and is responsible for deaths from heart and lung disease, severe respiratory problems and other illnesses also.  At some point in the new year, we will have a debate on the HSE's national service plan whereby a lot of money was taken out of health care.  As we know, however, we can save money if we can convince people to smoke and drink less.  Senator Crown has been very vocal about reducing drinking and has brought sensible proposals both here and at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  <\/p><p>If we can change people's habits, culture and mindset in these two critical areas, we will be able to save money thus freeing it up for the health services.  It would be better spent on providing increased treatment for illnesses.<\/p><p>The lobbying of elected representatives and the Oireachtas generally should be more open, transparent and accountable.  I think we would all accept that.  The development of the Oireachtas committee system has helped in that regard because we can bring organisations in for consultation.  Senator Crown sits on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I was a member for my first two years in the Oireachtas.  When the previous Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, was developing policy in this area, the joint committee invited in all stakeholders, including the drinks industry and those campaigning to reduce the availability of alcohol.  That was the way to do it.  In that regard the committee system has offered opportunities to consider this and other issues. <\/p><p>While I support the intent of the Bill and in no way question its motivation, I do have concerns about it which are similar to those expressed by Senator Colm Burke.  There could be wider implications and unintended consequences if this Bill was passed, including possible constitutional implications.<\/p> <p>I believe the way to test this would be for the Minister to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage.  When members of the Opposition utilise Private Members' time to bring forward Bills, the Government, rather than knock them back because there is a problem with them, should allow them to progress to Committee Stage where they could be shaped, moulded and improved.  That would be a much better way of doing things.  <\/p><p>I support the Bill on the basis that if allowed to progress to Committee Stage any issues arising, including constitutional issues, can be addressed.  However, I believe the Bill may set a dangerous precedent in terms of whom elected representatives are permitted to meet and what are defined as permitted meetings.  If we are to go down this road, there are a number of issues that need to be properly teased out.  I strongly believe that allowing the Bill to progress to Committee Stage would provide us with an opportunity to tease out those issues and improve the Bill if necessary.  I hope that the Minister will accept the Bill, which can then be improved on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I again commend Senator Crown and the Minister on their pioneering work in this area.  Long may it continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800046#XX00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387384200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

At the outset of his contribution Senator Crown, an eminent consultant oncologist in Ireland, said he had over the past few years spoken for about 20 minutes to the Minister for Health about this issue and that he would, to use his words, &quot;kill for more time&quot; with the Minister to discuss this issue.  I am sure that the Minister and Senator Crown have taken legal advice on this matter.  There must be some middle ground on this issue.  I ask that the Minister sit down with Senator Crown to thrash out the constitutional issues and try to reach some agreement on this worthwhile legislation.  If we could reduce the number of people smoking, we would reduce health costs.  What is being collected in terms of taxation on tobacco is being spent on the medical cost of curing or fighting cancer and other pulmonary diseases.  I ask that the Minister afford Senator Crown the time he requires, following which, perhaps, the Bill can be reintroduced at a later stage when a middle ground on this issue has been found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800047#YY00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1387384200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill introduced by Senator Crown and thank the Minister for his efforts in the battle against smoking.

Like many Members, I am a non-smoker.  However, as Senator Crown has accused anybody who sells tobacco or alcohol of being a drug dealer, I was a drug dealer for many years in that through my business I sold cigarettes for approximately 45 years.  On the other hand, I was aware there were things which those of us in business could do even though we could not stop selling alcohol or tobacco.  In 1984, Superquinn was the first supermarket to ban cigarette smoking in store.  This was not only for safety reasons but to ensure that customers could shop in a better environment.<\/p><p>The Minister stated earlier that as a result of smoking 5,200 Irish people and 700,000 people in Europe die each year and that Ireland ranks highest in terms of the youngest age at which people take up smoking.  These are horrific statistics.  Therefore, this debate has been well worthwhile.  Early in April this year the Minister introduced the Regulation of Lobbying Bill.  However, it has not yet been enacted.  Let us ensure that when it becomes law - which I gather will be very soon - this issue is addressed in it.  Why does it take so long for legislation to come through?  I have introduced a number of Bills in this House, in particular the Construction Contracts Bill.  It took three years to get it introduced.  I do not understand that.  I believe we could progress this particular Bill very quickly.  Debates on legislation such as the Regulation of Lobbying Bill should be much more open than on any other piece of legislation so that everybody knows exactly what is proposed.<\/p><p>In the context of the report of Seanad reform in 2004 I proposed in a paper that all lobbying would take place in the open and in this House.  I believe that was and is worthy of consideration.  I hope that the Regulation of Lobbying Bill will enable this practice.  It is one of the steps open to us to take.  Senator Crown has in the context of the introduction of this Bill addressed two pet hates of mine, namely, tobacco and behind the scenes lobbying.  Let us by all means allow lobbying but let us ensure it is open.  Let us by all means allow people who wish to smoke to do so but let us not encourage smoking.  I believe the Minister is taking the right steps and that his heart is in the right place.  I believe one important step would be acceptance by the Minister of this Bill this evening, which can then be improved upon on Committee Stage.  I am sure if this happens it will be legislation of which the Minister, too, will be proud. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800047#YY00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1387384200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like others, I thank him for his work on this issue.  I also thank my colleague, Senator Crown, on the introduction of this important Bill.  The Seanad has engaged in public consultation on the issue of cancer and how lifestyle is causing one third of all cancers.  The Minister will be aware of the serious cost in this regard in terms of human lives and the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Like Senator van Turnhout, I support the principle of the Bill.  The issue of transparency is relevant this week when one considers the issues that have arisen in relation to NAMA.<\/p> <p>Transparency is important in an organisation whose sole motivation is profit and is spending billions to ensure that legislation restricting its activities is not enacted, using every means both legal and, in some cases, illegal in order to achieve its ends to frustrate and delay, as the Minister has pointed out, the enacting of any legislation that would prevent it making far greater profits.  Any such organisation should be held up to the highest scrutiny in terms of its transparency and interaction with the Government.<\/p><p>We need to consider what tobacco companies did in Europe in their efforts to frustrate the European Union's efforts.  That is not the most transparent organisation in terms of the number of moving parts in it and the number of people who were being wined and dined in order to prevent and frustrate legislation that would stop the tobacco industry selling more of its products.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, that industry is successful in Ireland in marketing to young people because more people take up smoking at a young age here than in any other European country.  The Irish Cancer Society advises us that the tobacco industry is trying to derail efforts to stop Irish people from dying from smoking.  The more cigarettes the tobacco companies sell, the more people will die, which is of great concern.  Some 700,000 people in Europe die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, which is a shocking figure.  If that was gun-related crime, obviously we would ban them in the morning.  However, this is self-inflicted.  Not only is it a cost to the family in terms of the loss of a loved-one but also the cost to the taxpayer in terms of the health care expenditure necessary to look after people who are dying as a result of the sale of tobacco.  If we were doing it now, we would not allow it at all and yet it persists and prevails.  To a large degree the tobacco industry continues to prevail on the back of spending money on lobbying - not of Deputies and Senators - but in backroom meetings.  The purpose of the Bill is to prevent backroom meetings and have them out in public.<\/p><p>We have all been here for debates on Private Members' Bills.

I am aware of Bills that were written by professional draftspeople, who have worked for all parties, and were accepted by Ministers when they were in opposition.  Now that they are in government, the same legislation, written by the same people with the same competencies and who know what is constitutional and what is not, is being rejected not by the Government, but by the permanent government, which does not like change.  They do not like this legislation because departmental officials will be scrutinised more than anybody else under this legislation.<\/p><p>Why do we not have whistleblowing legislation?

I thank the Minister.  I do not like to be cast in an adversarial role with him <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> any tobacco control issue, as I know his heart is absolutely in the right place.  I wish to thank two other people tonight.  I pay very special thanks to Senator White for coming in tonight - I am very grateful to her.  I also acknowledge the work Senator O'Donnell did earlier in highlighting other problems relating to lobbying, which helped to put the lobbying question on the agenda.<\/p><p>  The Minister's arguments against the Bill seem to fall along four main lines: it is unprecedented and we would be the first; we are disproportionately criminalising; it is unconstitutional; and he plans to introduce similar reforms anyway.  Being first is good.  Prior to 1964 no government had ever stated as government policy that smoking caused cancer or acknowledged a link.  The US Surgeon General was the first person to do so in 1964; he was not the last.  In 2004, Deputy Martin was the first Minister for Health and Children to have an entire country rendered smoke-free in the workplace.  He was the first - there was no precedent - but he was not the last.  This is now the norm throughout the world.  In 2013, Australia was the first country to state it would introduce a blanket ban on pictorial logo depictions on cigarettes and to introduce mandatory plain packaging; it will not be the last.  I am very happy and proud that Ireland, under the Minister's leadership, will be the second and we will not be the last.  This will be the policy in many countries around the world.<\/p><p>  Similarly with lobbying, let us be the first; I promise we will not be the last.  If we pass this Bill, it will ring around the world as another onslaught in the worldwide battle against tobacco and recognition of the problem lobbying causes in Washington, Brussels, Strasbourg, London, Tokyo, Dublin and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  On criminality, we have already criminalised certain aspects of smoking-related behaviour.  We have criminalised advertising.  A company cannot advertise tobacco products in the broadcast media.  We have criminalised the sale of tobacco to children.  We have criminalised smoking in the workplace.  We have done all this before.  There is nothing unprecedented about us criminalising illicit contacts between Government officials and the tobacco industry.  On the disproportionality of the criminality, let us be blunt; the tobacco industry imposed the death penalty on our citizens.  There is nothing disproportionate about us criminalising any part of its activities.<\/p><p>  What about the constitutionality?  Is it wrong or illicit for us to ban assembly or speech?  We do it all the time.  We do not allow politicians to discuss criminal cases with judges.  We sequester juries completely to keep them away.  There are plenty of precedents for limiting for society's benefit what would otherwise be untrammelled freedom of speech.<\/p><p>  The last part of this is the most painful part and I ask the Minister not to take it personally.  I, better than most, have some understanding of how difficult it is to get health reforms to work through that gluey, treacly bureaucracy that is our health system.  The Minister has told us he opposes the Bill because he will introduce something else.  Sadly, the track record is not great in this regard.  It is nearly two years since we initiated the Protection of Children&rsquo;s Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill.  I just do not trust the bureaucracy to let this thing happen quickly enough.<\/p><p>  In addition, people have talked about smoke-free campuses.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children voted against making the Houses of the Oireachtas a smoke-free campus.  That committee had another vote recently - I will not go into who voted which way - to invite representatives of the tobacco to address the committee, which I very much oppose.  If we buy into the line that we cannot do this because we might face a subsequent legal challenge, we are laying ourselves down prostrate in the face of legal intimidation by the tobacco companies.  When their arguments that smoking does not cause cancer and that nicotine is not addictive were shown to be spurious, they then resorted to all these legal challenges.<\/p><p>  Let a message ring out from Seanad &Eacute;ireann, from Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, from Dublin, from our democracy that we are going to tackle the problem of tobacco lobbying and introduce a strategy which I know will be copied and emulated around the world.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800048#ZZ01200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387385400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387385400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>The Seanad divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387385400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Under Standing Order 62(3)(b) I request that the division be taken again other than by electronic means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800049#BBB00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"vote","time":1387385400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 23; N\u00edl, 25.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Sean D.

I was against the grouping for the south and the break-up of the south-east region.  Having said that, once the Government made its decision we need to ensure that the promises and commitments given by Professor Higgins in his report, and later by the Government and the HSE, are followed through and honoured.  We must ensure that we make the best of the new hospital grouping.  We must support it as best we can in order to ensure that the services at the hospital are protected, maintained and enhanced.<\/p><p>As the Minister will know, two solid commitments were given in the Higgins report that would be positive and of benefit to the hospital.  The first commitment was that the hospital would become a university teaching hospital with academic links to Cork University Hospital and the appointment of five academic consultants.  Have the consultant posts been appointed?  If not, when will they be appointed?<\/p><p>The second commitment given in the Higgins report was to provide 24-7 cardiology services at the hospital.  The report dealt with structural change so it was strange to include such a commitment.  We discussed the matter on the Adjournment.  The report talked about enhanced cardiology services but when Professor Higgins and the Minister were pressed on the matter they said that the provision of a 24-7 cardiology service was the aim.  That is what we want for the hospital and that promise and commitment was given to consultants at the hospital.  I seek clarification on the matter.  The Higgins report talked about enhanced cardiology services for Waterford Regional Hospital.  Did that translate into 24-7 cardiology services?  If it did, when will the service be provided?  I ask the Minister to appraise us on whether all of the positions have been filled.  As we know, once groups are established there must be a CEO, chair and board appointed.  Have the positions been filled?  If not, when will they be filled?  <\/p><p>I want the Minister to update the House on the status of the new grouping, the work done since the publication of the report, the progress made and give a timeframe for work that is outstanding.  The two critical areas I seek clarity on are the 24-7 cardiology service and the five consultant posts. <\/p><p>Finally, I spoke to consultants who work at the hospital who said that five consultant posts are needed to protect and enhance services.

The introduction of hospital groups will provide for organisational change in the first instance, giving more autonomy and better enabling the reorganisation of services in a well planned manner.  Over time, this will help to improve services and, most importantly, deliver better outcomes for patients.  That is what the health service is about - patient care and improving outcomes for patients.<\/p><p>In July, expressions of interest were invited through the Public Appointments Service for appointment as chairpersons and members of hospital group boards.  I have now appointed Dr. Tom Lynch as chair of the Dublin East Hospital Group, Dr. Frank Dolphin as chair of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, Ms Anne Maher as chair of the Dublin North East Group and Professor Geraldine McCarthy as chair of the South-South West Hospital Group, to which Waterford Regional Hospital belongs.

It is anticipated that interviews will be held in early January.<\/p><p>My Department is also working with the chairmen, including Professor McCarthy, with a view to appointing the other board members as soon as possible.  I believe that the chairs should have an input into the process as they will have to chair and work with the board members.  <\/p><p>A strategic advisory group is being established by my Department, chaired by Mr. Leo Kearns.  The strategic advisory group will oversee the establishment of hospital groups and the subsequent re-organisation of acute hospital services.  Each group of hospitals will work together as a single cohesive entity managed as one in order to provide acute care for patients in their areas, integrating with community and primary care.  This will maximise the amount of care delivered locally while ensuring complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.<\/p><p>Hospital groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan that will outline their plans for future services within the group area.  The strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group, including the South-South West Group and Waterford Regional Hospital within that group.<\/p><p>As was committed to at the time of the report's publication, Waterford will continue to operate as a cancer centre under the national cancer control programme.<\/p> <p>It will be the hub for the south-east renal service, and a regional trauma centre including emergency department, ear, nose and throat, and ophthalmology.  It will also continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the south-east population.  I understand that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is currently examining options within the existing hospital for the location of the second catheterisation laboratory.<\/p><p>In addition, an undertaking was given that my Department and the HSE would work with University College Cork, UCC, to enable Waterford hospital become a university teaching hospital, and this work is ongoing.  UCC will be the primary academic partner for the South-South West Hospital Group.  This will be to the benefit of all hospitals in the group across all services including cancer services and in the areas of research, education and innovation, and will secure the future progress of Waterford Regional Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800050#CCC00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387386300,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his clarifications but unfortunately he has not addressed the two core issues I put to him.

I am delighted to have the Minister in the House but I regret the Minister for Education and Skills is not present because this issue has been his baby, so to speak, for quite some time.  As a nation we still do not have a clue where he will get the teachers to implement Chinese across the country in all second level schools from September 2014.<\/p><p>I am very aware of many of the developments in this area as I am quite involved in it.  I have 21 schools in Galway teaching Chinese language and culture.  In an initiative I started I have two young native Chinese teachers who spent three days, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, in Galway with 21 schools.  They are in 21 classes, both primary and second level.  The excitement is huge among the students.  I have visited some of them in their classrooms.  Their methodologies are excellent.  I get the teachers' services for free from Confucius Institute in Cork.  Working with the 21 schools in Galway city and county I have five clusters, one in Tuam, one in south Galway, one in Oranmore, one in Galway city and one in Athenry.  Each of the schools make a small contribution which covers the teachers' accommodation, food and travel.<\/p><p>This is a local initiative.  The hype is amazing, and many more schools are looking to have these services.  We did this deliberately because we know we have to look to the world, and not just Europe or America, in terms of the future of our young people.  The Taoiseach has been to China.  Xi Jinping has been to Ireland.  If we are to do business with China the language, not just the culture, must be understood.  This is about the roll out of the Chinese language and culture programme from September 2014 in our schools.<\/p><p>I have been involved with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which is developing the short course.  I am in consultation with the people working on that.  I know from speaking to people in some of our education centres, and I spoke with Galway education centre today, that there have not been any instructions yet about how the roll-out will be achieved.  I know from speaking to some of the people developing the programme that they do not know how the roll-out will be achieved.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to indicate from where we will get the teachers to achieve a national roll-out?  Will we have a model whereby native Chinese teachers will work with out own teachers?  We have only a few Irish national teachers learning Chinese.  There is great interest in the media in this short course.  There is great hype.  We are getting great kudos for it but let it not be a disaster and therefore we need to be ready.  That is the reason I raise the issue with the Minister.  I look forward to his answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800051#DDD01200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1387386300,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I must compliment the Senator on what she is engaged in promoting, namely, the teaching of Chinese to young people in her city and county.  It is great to hear it.<\/p><p>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  The Framework for Junior Cycle published last October places students at the centre of the educational experience, enabling them to actively participate in their communities and in society, and to be resourceful and confident learners in all aspects and stages of their lives.  Junior cycle is inclusive of all students and contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcome for all.  It will create interested, independent learners who will be better prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond school.<\/p><p>Short courses are an important part of the reformed junior cycle.  They will link directly to the statements of learning and will be designed for approximately 100 hours of student engagement.  Some short courses, such as those on Chinese language and culture and on programming and coding, will be developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and can be used &quot;off the shelf&quot; by schools.  However, it is important to note that short courses are not compulsory and there is no national roll out; schools will decide which short courses, if any, to offer.  Schools are also free to develop their own short courses.<\/p><p>The development by the NCCA of the short course on Chinese language and culture is a very welcome and exciting development.  A growing number of young people are interested in learning Chinese and discovering the culture and way of life of Chinese people.  This course will provide a learning base in Mandarin Chinese, which students can build on subsequently.  They will also learn about China and understand and experience many aspects of Chinese culture.  Students will develop their communication skills, their ability to interact successfully with people from Chinese and other cultures, and their capacity to be effective language learners.  The focus is on active engagement by students through participation in varied tasks and in using digital media.<\/p> <p>The Senator might be aware that a number of post-primary schools already provide courses or modules in lesser-taught languages, including but not limited to Chinese.  It is a matter for schools to determine how best to facilitate such provision, with reference to the needs of the students and the existing resources within the school, including teaching staff.<\/p><p>In relation to qualifications, the Teaching Council is the statutory body for the recognition of teachers.  At this time, the council does not register teachers for post-primary teaching on the basis of a qualification in Chinese language and culture.  As this is a developing area, it will be kept under review.  I understand most Mandarin Chinese in schools is taught by visiting native teachers funded by the Confucius Institutes.  The Confucius Institute in UCD is involved in training registered teachers of other subjects to deliver transition year modules in Chinese culture.  In the case of the new junior cycle, it is up to schools to offer programmes that meet their needs and aims.  They are responsible for sourcing and deploying staff with the expertise to deliver the programme offered.  I thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to outline the current position in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800051#DDD01300","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387386900,"counter":389,"content":"<p>While the Minister of State's answer is helpful, it is unbelievably disappointing.

T&aacute; aistri&uacute; roinnt taifead &oacute; aonad na bhforas cult&uacute;rtha, maidir le hearn&aacute;il na n-eala&iacute;on, chuig an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta socraithe ag mo Roinn cheana f&eacute;in i mbliana.  Ina theannta sin, aistr&iacute;odh roinnt taifead &oacute; bhrainse logainmneacha na Roinne &oacute; na blianta 1946 go 1983 chuig an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta i m&iacute; na Samhna i mbliana.  Ba mhaith liom a dhearbh&uacute; don Teachta go bhfuil oifigigh mo Roinne ag obair go dl&uacute;th le hoifigigh sa Chartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta maidir le haistri&uacute; tuilleadh taifead chuig an gcartlann.  Go deimhin, t&aacute; mo Roinn i gcomhairle leis an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta maidir le taifid a bhaineann leis an gceantar Gaeltachta ach go h&aacute;irithe chun cl&aacute;r oibre a phl&eacute; chun taifid at&aacute; os cionn 30 bliain d'aois a aistri&uacute;.  T&aacute; cl&aacute;r oibre comhaontaithe.  Is &iacute; mo thuiscint go n-aistreofar roinnt taifead a bhaineann leis an tr&eacute;imhse 1929 go 1975 chuig an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta an tseachtain seo.<\/p><p>  Tion&oacute;lann an Chartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta r&eacute;amhbhreathn&uacute; me&aacute;n gach Nollaig.

N&iacute; m&oacute;r a n&oacute;t&aacute;il go bhfaigheann an Chartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta taifid &oacute; Ranna Rialtais ar feadh na bliana, an tr&eacute;imhse tar &eacute;is an r&eacute;amhbhreathnaithe me&aacute;n san &aacute;ireamh, agus leanfar leis sin sa bhliain 2014.

The key point is that the youth guarantee does exactly what it says on the tin.  It delivers a quality education training and-or work experience opportunity to young jobseekers within four months of their becoming unemployed.  There are many issues I could raise here but given the time limit I will focus on five key questions.  We do need a debate, and I hope that happens in the new year.  I regret that I had to resort to tabling a matter on the Adjournment because during the debate on the social welfare Bill the Minister gave a commitment to coming back to the House and on more than one occasion I requested that she come back to the House.<\/p><p>The first question relates to funding.  Can the Minister provide any clarity on the overall financial envelope that the Government plans to invest in the youth guarantee in 2014 and 2015?  The Taoiseach mentioned a figure of &euro;100 million per annum following the recent summit on youth unemployment held by President Hollande of France.  Is there any clarity on the budget?<\/p><p>A recent OECD report noted that there is only one case worker per 800 unemployed persons of all ages, which is twice the Nordic average.  Will the Irish plan invest in job counselling and guidance? <\/p><p>Young jobseekers are not a homogeneous group.  We have heard about literacy and many other problems.  Can the Minister give us some detail on the range of provision to meet the different needs of young jobseekers?  Will there be new initiatives or is the Government merely planning to top up existing programmes? <\/p><p>Even if there were sufficient places available tomorrow some young people who have literacy issues, poor prior experience of formal education, substance misuse, family difficulties or long-term unemployment may need additional support to engage in activation measures.  Will the Minister confirm that the Irish plan will provide a way to ensure that the contribution of the youth work organisations and the youth work sector can be enhanced and harnessed because it has been proved that they can reach these young jobseekers?<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will agree that the youth guarantee cannot be delivered by the Government alone.  I welcome the fact that the Department of Social Protection held a stakeholder forum on 14 October last and invited written submissions.  The organisations that were consulted are concerned by the lack of information since then on the Irish plan, which we know must be submitted by the end of the year.  Will the Minister commit to engaging with stakeholders in early 2014 on the plan?  Will there be a further stakeholder forum where the details of the plan can be discussed?  Will the Minister return as she promised in this House on 7 November last and engage with the Members of the Seanad on this issue of the youth guarantee and Ireland&rsquo;s plan? <\/p><p>I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, is in a difficult position because the Minister for Social Protection is not here but can the Minister outline the governance and oversight of the implementation of the youth guarantee in Ireland and confirm that it will be along the lines of the Ballymun pilot, with involvement of key stakeholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800053#FFFF00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387387500,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and affording me the opportunity to provide the Seanad, on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, with an update on recent developments.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the Minister for Social Protection brought a memo to Cabinet with a draft plan for the implementation of the EU recommendation on a youth guarantee.  The recommendation is that member states should: &quot;Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.&quot;  In agreeing this recommendation, the EU accepted that the guarantee would need to be implemented over a period of time on a phased basis in countries, such as Ireland, facing very significant fiscal constraints.<\/p><p>The development of the draft implementation plan was led by the Department of Social Protection working with the support of an interdepartmental group of senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the T&aacute;naiste.  The draft plan brings together all Government measures in 2014 across a range of Departments that contribute to the transition of young people from education to work, and from unemployment to work.  In keeping with the Government focus on tackling long-term unemployment, it is proposed that the four-month interventions will be targeted in the first instance at those young people most at risk of long-term unemployment as the guarantee is introduced on a phased basis.<\/p><p>Ireland already has most of the key elements of a youth guarantee in place including: a quality offer of second level education for all young people under 18; second chance education or training options for early school leavers via Youthreach and community training centres; access to free third-level and further education programmes; apprenticeship and work-focused training initiatives such as Momentum; access to a range of employment programmes and supports including internships, JobBridge; work experience, T&uacute;s; employment subsidies, JobsPlus, and job-search or guidance services, Intreo centres and via Jobslreland.  Accordingly, in order to maximise the return from structures already in place, it is proposed to build, and reserve places, on the existing programmes for young people already long-term unemployed; develop variants of these programmes and offers tailored specifically for young unemployed people.  These tailored offers will include: a differentiated fast-track engagement option under Intreo with earlier and faster engagement for young people; a special JobBridge programme targeted at young people at particularly high risk of long-term unemployment, including, for example, early school-leavers and young people from marginalised communities; and a JobsPlus offer for selected young people at the four-month threshold of unemployment.  This will offer employers an incentive to recruit young people who face high barriers to employment before their period of unemployment becomes prolonged.  There will also be an earmarked allocation in the MicroFinance Ireland fund for business start-ups and a reserved allocation of places for young people on programmes such as Momentum, with 2,000 places reserved and T&uacute;s with 1,000 places reserved.<\/p><p>It is estimated that expenditure on these programmes for young people will be in excess of &euro;300 million in 2014.  This includes existing and new funding, including the EU funding that is expected to be drawn down.  The Cabinet gave its approval yesterday for this proposed approach and following from that approval, the plan is being prepared for transmission to the European Commission before the end of this month.  The plan will be published in January.<\/p><p>In response to the Senator's question on consultation, following the stakeholders forum in October to which she refers, the Department of Social Protection sought submissions from those who attended.<\/p> <p>Submissions have since been received from a range of bodies and individuals, including the South Tipperary Local Development Company, Wexford Local Development, National Youth Council of Ireland, SpunOut.ie, Ms Emer Costello, MEP, Youth Work Ireland, Tipperary Regional Youth Service, Education and Training Boards Ireland and a joint published submission from the Union of Students in Ireland, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Officials of the Department have also discussed the issues raised by the guarantee with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, as well as with the Employment Leadership Group, a group of over 100 HR directors and business leaders from Ireland's top companies with a specific focus on the problem of unemployment and on job creation.<\/p><p>Finally, the Department commissioned the OECD to provide advice on the implementation of a youth guarantee.  It was asked in particular to identify best international practice and how it might best be applied to Ireland.  The OECD made an interim presentation on its views to Ministers and officials from relevant Departments two weeks ago and will present its final report by the end of the year.  The OECD's interim report informed the draft implementation plan and its final report will be published along with the implementation plan in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800053#FFFF00300","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387388100,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I would also encourage engagement with the youth work sector and youth work organisations.  These organisations are best placed to reach those hard to reach young people who are not traditionally targeted in the programmes.  The youth guarantee gives us an opportunity to, once and for all, give these young people hope and give them a pathway to work.  However, that pathway needs careful guidance and I believe youth work organisations are best placed and have proven time and again that they can do it.  The Government cannot deliver this on its own; it should engage with stakeholders and not just consult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121800054#GGG00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387388100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator once again for raising the matter and for her personal interest in it, which I assure her is shared by all of us.
