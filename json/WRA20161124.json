This is 0.6 per cent higher than the level set out in the Estimates for 2016.  This increase in expenditure\u00a0reflects an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and\u00a0expenditure arising on\u00a0school building works.  In addition, an amount of &euro;220 million is included to fund a Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients.  In line with previous years, it is anticipated that the additional cost of providing this bonus will be offset by year-end savings across a number of Departments.  The Christmas Bonus will be funded through both voted expenditure and the Social Insurance Fund.  In addition, since publication of the Expenditure Report 2017, given the need to respond proactively to growing uncertainties for Irish based enterprise, additional funding is to be allocated to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2016.  This additional funding, which by fast-tracking the delivery of certain spending programmes in 2016 through an increased 2016 allocation, should provide the space for increased spending on Brexit initiatives in 2017 within the allocation for 2017 agreed at Budget time.

The Group recently presented for consideration and agreement by Government an interim report setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government at this time.  The report has been approved by the Government and is available on the OPW website, <\/p><p>The Government has agreed to key recommendations of the Group to introduce a targeted Voluntary Homeowner Relocation Scheme for those properties worst affected by last Winter&rsquo;s flooding, to further examine the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation and to continue the current strategy for improving the availability of flood insurance cover by prioritising spending on flood relief measures by OPW and relevant local authorities and improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry. <\/p><p>The National CFRAM Steering Group was formed in May 2009 to provide a forum to promote communication and coordination among key stakeholders in the implementation of the EU 'Floods' Directive, and for these stakeholders to provide their advice, input and knowledge on the overall direction and outputs of the National CFRAM Programme and related &lsquo;Floods&rsquo; Directive matters.  The Steering Group met on six occasions between May 2009 and November 2010 and the work was informed by the Pilot CFRAM Studies and the policy direction of the Interdepartmental Group.<\/p><p>During this period, the Steering Group provided input into:<\/p><p>- The Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment that provided the process to designate in early 2012 the 300 Areas for Further Assessment for consideration by the CFRAM Programme.<\/p><p>- The preparation of the CFRAM Brief that provided, inter alia, the appointment of engineering consultations through a procurement process and the appropriate governance structures for each of the six study areas.<\/p><p>- The preparation of the Statutory Instrument to transpose the EU 'Floods' Directive.<\/p><p>Robust governance structures were then established for each of the six CFRAM Study areas and these continue to meet on a regular basis.  The Steering Group was reconvened in November 2014 when the draft maps were being prepared for public consultation.  A further meeting took place in 2016 prior to the consultation on the draft Flood Risk Management Plans.  To date, the Steering Group has met on eight occasions and there have been over 250 meetings of the Project-level Steering and Progress Groups.  Given the study based governance structures, the OPW, as lead and competent authority for flood risk management in Ireland took responsibility for oversight and co-ordination of the CFRAM programme. <\/p><p>The Flood Risk Management Plans are a major step forward to help Government make informed investment decisions on flood risk management.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue support of flood relief is underlined in the provision of &euro;430 million to Flood Risk Management in the Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021.<\/p><p>Since last Winter, the OPW has accelerated its resources to complete major flood defence schemes.  This year there is a record of 12 major schemes at construction and a further 23 at design development stage.  These include schemes in Bandon, Crossmolina and Claregalway.  In addition, the OPW has approved &euro;4.3m to date this year in funding to local authorities for over 80 local flood relief projects under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  I have written to local authorities to encourage them to use this scheme to address localised flooding issues.  It has proven an ideal vehicle to deliver localised flooding solutions in both towns and rural areas.  All of these works will help in a very real way to protect against flooding and alleviate worry and hardship for so many more people.<\/p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the lead Government Department for the response to severe weather and flooding.  That Department has published a Review Report on the response to the severe flooding that affected many parts of the country during winter 2015-2016.  The report examines the preparedness measures in place for such events and the coordination and effectiveness of those responses.  The report draws together the learning points from the response activities and sets out a series of recommendations to improve the preparedness and response to future emergencies.  Many of these recommendations have been implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA08100","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA08300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA08200"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[36605\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA08300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has considered lowering the cost of registering rights of way under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that a Court Order under Section 35 of  the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 declaring the existence of an easement [right of way] acquired by prescription is required to be registered in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds as appropriate.

It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.<\/p>  <p>  It would remain the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity.

The important point is that Section 23 does not empower me to issue a direction to hold an inquest where the coroner does not believe that such an inquest is appropriate.  In relation to the particular case in question I am advised that the Coroner is of the opinion that an inquest would not be appropriate at this time.  In such circumstances the question of me, as Minister, directing an inquest does not arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA09900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA10000"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[36637\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400061#WRA10100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; stationed in Lucan, Ronanstown and Clondalkin as of September 2014, September 2015 and September 2016; her plans to increase the number of community garda&iacute; in these stations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Accordingly, there will be no suspension of ESIF funds.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In view of the Commission's considered opinion that that both Member States have delivered on their policy commitments, and that effective action has been taken to address their excessive deficits, we can support lifting the suspension of funds at this stage.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of flexibility more generally, it is clearly important that the rules are implemented in a fair and consistent manner and that all Member States are treated equally concerning the application of EU budget laws.  This is essential for continuing credibility.  However, some degree of flexibility should be allowed in certain circumstances, where this is appropriate and within the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For instance, the deadline for Ireland to correct its excessive deficit was extended on two occasions, in 2009 and in 2010, due to unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances.\u00a0\u00a0Ireland's excessive deficit has since been corrected in a durable manner and the country is now subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400062#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400062#WRB06100"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[36619\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400062#WRB06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>A person who disposes of a foreign life assurance policy is chargeable to capital gains tax on the profit of their investment or in respect of the growth in value of the policy.

An expansion of up to 0.5 per cent of GDP is recommended by the Commission.\u00a0 It is crucial to stress that the Commission recommends that this expansion be differentiated by country and, in particular, with reference to Member States' positions with respect to the fiscal rules.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, the Commission is recommending that Member States that are over-achieving their budgetary targets should use this excess fiscal space. \u00a0The rationale is that this spending in some Member States would support the recovery in the euro area as a whole as other Member States would be able to ramp up exports to those Member States implementing an expansionary policy.<\/p>  <p>  What this means for Ireland in particular is that the Commission is recommending that Member States that have not yet achieved their targets, i.e. a balanced budget, should continue on the adjustment path.\u00a0 In other words, Ireland should continue to implement the fiscal policy as laid out in the Budget.<\/p>  <p>  My Department broadly agrees with the Commission recommendation to the euro area as a whole.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p><p>I would advise that if there are children in the school for whom there are particular concerns the Principal should raise these concerns with the assigned NEPS Psychologist with a view to determining what course of action is appropriate to alleviate these concerns<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, a review of the DEIS Programme which commenced last year is currently nearing completion and a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion will be published before the end of this year.  The Review process includes the development of a new identification framework to assess the level of educational disadvantage in schools.  This new framework will assess all schools in the country, including the school to which the Deputy refers in his question,  and it will not be necessary for school to make an application for assessment.  Pending the completion of the Review, it is not my intention to make any changes to the current programme, including the inclusion of additional schools. <\/p><p>In relation to the new SEN model I might explain that the NCSE identified that the current model for allocating resource teachers to schools is potentially inequitable, because access to the range of professional assessments required for the diagnosis of low incident disabilities is not always readily available to those who cannot afford to access them privately.  The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.<\/p><p>The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.<\/p><p>A pilot of this new model was conducted in 47 primary and post primary schools over the course of the 2015\/16 school year. A review of this pilot has been completed and a report of the review is currently being finalised. It is understood that the review will indicate that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents.<\/p><p>Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources. Schools also welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need. In addition schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with Special Educational Needs.<\/p><p>As part the recent Budget announcements, it was therefore announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  <\/p><p>An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts.  <\/p><p>Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[36645\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of vacancies on boards or agencies within his Department's remit that currently exist; the number that have been filled since 8 May 2016; the number of these that were filled through the Public Appointments Service; the timeline for filling remaining vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[36836\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of vacancies on State boards in his Department; the number filled since he took office; the number filled through the Public Appointments Service; the timelines to fill vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 106 together.<\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister, forty two appointments have been made to State Boards of Bodies under the aegis of my Department. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of vacancies as well as the dates the vacancies arose in the State Agencies under the remit of my Department is provided in the attached table, which is publicly available on the Department's website. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that individuals may be nominated for appointment by various organisations arising from the terms in the relevant Statutes of the Body concerned and accordingly board appointments while made by me are not in all cases made at my discretion.<\/p><p>In line with guidelines for appointments to State Boards the process for the filling of vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of the Department is now typically managed by the Public Appointments Services (PAS), whereby applicants are made through the dedicated website www.Stateboards.ie.

The work of the Teaching Council is grounded in the values of professionally-led regulation, shared professional responsibility and collective professional confidence.<\/p>  <p>  The period between qualification and fully independent practice as a teacher is a vital stage of the newly qualified teacher's career.  During this phase the newly qualified teacher's development as a practising professional is facilitated by coherent and supportive induction and probation processes specified by the Teaching Council, which all teachers must successfully complete to achieve full registration.  The Teaching Council works closely with the Department to ensure appropriate supports for newly qualified teachers are in place and the Department funds the national induction programme for teachers, NIPT.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to facilitate newly qualified teachers in achieving full registration with the Teaching Council.  The minimum service requirement for probation for primary teachers has been reduced from 170 days to 100 days. <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act applicants for teaching posts in recognised schools are required to be registered with the Teaching Council. <\/p>  <p>  While the recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school or Education and Training Board, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012), Circular 31\/2011 details a number of measures for recruitment of teachers. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones.  Each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances, where relevant, that a registered teacher in receipt of a public service pension or an unregistered person has been engaged.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that, this September, 2,260 additional teaching posts were available in our primary and post primary schools due to additional funding secured in Budget 2016.  In addition, further provision has been made in Budget 2017 for 2,400 additional posts.  These posts, together with the measures outlined above, will enhance the opportunities for newly qualified teachers to obtain post qualification teaching experience to achieve full registration with the Teaching Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that a newly qualified teacher who is unable to complete a condition for registration within the specified period may apply to the Teaching Council for an extension to that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting of Personnel","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[36660\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will change the rules surrounding the Garda vetting process for teachers which currently means that a substitute teacher must complete a separate Garda vetting for each school that they work in; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>In April of this year, the Minister for Justice and Equality commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 (the Vetting Act) which put in place statutory vetting requirements for the Garda vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable persons, including those working in schools.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Act&rsquo;s commencement, \u00a0my Department published (in April 2015) a circular which outlined the advance preparations and actions to be taken by all school authorities and registered teachers so as to facilitate, as far as possible, a smooth transition to the statutory vetting requirements once they became operational.\u00a0 These included specific steps to be taken both by school authorities and registered teachers as to help ensure that teachers would be readily employable in substitute teaching positions arising in schools post commencement of the statutory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  When the vetting requirements were commenced in April of this year, my Department published a further circular which set out the statutory vetting requirements applicable to schools along with the practical arrangements in place to support the vetting procedures.\u00a0\u00a0This circular (0031\/2016) contains information about the limited exemptions to the requirement under Section 12(1) of the Vetting Act to obtain a vetting disclosure from the National Vetting Bureau prior to commencing an employment, including information about the exemptions that apply in certain circumstances to substitute teaching positions. <\/p>  <p>  Amendments to the Teaching Council Act enacted in 2015 also made provision for the Teaching Council to put in place a streamlined electronic mechanism for school employers to meet the requirements of the Vetting Act in respect of registered teachers.\u00a0\u00a0This mechanism ensures that once a vetting disclosure is obtained by the Teaching Council in respect of a registered teacher, that disclosure can, with the consent of the teacher concerned, be made available electronically to any school employer that requires it for the purposes of the Vetting Act, including where required in respect of substitute teaching positions.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Expenditure","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[36686\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400064#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the average per capita spending allocation to universities and institutes of technology; and the basis on which different per capita allocations are made.","asker":"1222","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>My Department allocates the total recurrent funding allocation\u00a0to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the HEA designated higher education institutions (HEIs)\u00a0including the Universities and Institutes of Technology.

The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>The RTB has 40 staff in place at present with sanction for an additional 11 posts.  The RTB is currently working to fill these posts.  In 2012, the RTB awarded a contract outsourcing its call-centre activities and the processing of paper registrations, allowing the Board to focus on its dispute resolution functions.  There are currently 34 people employed on the RTB account by t he outsourced service provider.<\/p><p>As the RTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes, there are statutory time periods laid down in the Residential Tenancies Act to provide for due process.  There are a number of factors that may delay the processing of a case including where adjournment requests are made or where there are difficulties locating a party to the dispute.<\/p><p>The RTB received 4,023 applications for dispute resolution in 2015, a 19% increase on 2014, when 3,374 cases were received.  In 2015, some 84% of cases were processed or closed within 3 to 4 months.  The RTB is continuously reviewing operations to increase efficiency and processing times continue to improve.  The RTB reports that currently 96% of cases are completed in 4 months or less &ndash; a considerable improvement when compared to the 84% achieved in 2015.<\/p><p>A telephone mediation service was introduced by the RTB in late 2013 as an alternative means to address disputes.  Processing times for telephone mediation cases in 2015 were typically 6 to 9 weeks.  Processing times for telephone mediation have improved further in the course of 2016 to an average of 6 weeks.  The average processing time for disputes referred to an Adjudicator was 14 weeks in 2015 and has improved to an average of 10 weeks in 2016.<\/p><p>Parties to a dispute can appeal the decision of an Adjudicator to a Tenancy Tribunal within 21 days of the date of receiving the adjudicators report.  Parties to the mediation process who did not reach an agreement or where the agreement has broken down may refer the dispute to the Tenancy Tribunal within 10 days.  The average processing times for Tribunal cases is 8 to 12 weeks from appeal to the issuing of the Determination Order.<\/p><p>The RTB&rsquo;s funding is derived primarily from a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations, as set down by Ministerial Order.  Since 1 July 2016, the RTB is entitled to retain 100% of the registration fee income to fund its activities.  The RTB also retains the fees it charges for its dispute resolution services.  In 2016, the RTB also received &euro;1.5m in funding from the Exchequer in relation to the planning and procurement of the new tenancy deposit protection scheme and &euro;0.35m to fund operational costs.<\/p><p>The deposit protection scheme will be commenced as soon as the necessary conditions are in place to support roll-out.  These are likely to include changes to the supporting information technology and contracts with outsourced project partners where appropriate.  Work in this regard is already underway.  Until the scheme is operational and ready to go live, there will be no change in the administration of tenancy deposits under the Act.<\/p><p>Details of the Board&rsquo;s income and expenditure are set out in its Annual Reports and Accounts, which are available on its website at .<\/p><p>My Department continues to keep the resources available to the RTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this matter.

An additional 51 units have been approved for leasing by two Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and are anticipated to become operational by the end of 2016, bringing the total number of operational units to 87.

This funding approach is being used to support the acquisition and construction of 55 additional units by three AHBs in Cavan and Monaghan. Delivery is contingent on AHBs securing the balance of funding required from either private finance or other borrowings.  If successful, it is anticipated that these 55 units will be delivered by the end of 2017.  Locations include Kingscourt, Clones and Carrickmacross.<\/p><p>The HAP is currently available in 19 local authority areas, including Monaghan County Council, and to eligible homeless households in the Dublin local authorities under the Homeless HAP pilot scheme.  Since Monaghan&rsquo;s commencement of the HAP statutory pilot scheme on 1 October 2014, almost 350 households have been supported to date and HAP support will continue into 2017 and beyond.  There are currently more than 15,000 households nationally being supported by the scheme and 10,690 of these tenancies have been set-up in 2016 to date.

Clearly, a substantial portion of the population may suffer significant unwanted reductions in living standards in their retirement years unless they begin to save for that retirement. <\/p>  <p>  Work is already underway on this reform.  Last year, a group was established, chaired by the Department of Social Protection and made up of senior officials from a range of public bodies and international pension reform experts, to look at the elements of a Universal Retirement Savings System and to produce a roadmap for the Government to consider.  The primary aim is to develop a system that provides for universal coverage and that also significantly improves adequacy of provision over time.  Initial work has concentrated on whether the best model would be one which is mandatory for all workers without supplementary retirement savings coverage or one which would automatically enrol those without supplementary retirement savings coverage while allowing an opt-out. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis of international systems has been undertaken which clearly demonstrates the importance of establishing consensus across political, business and civil society lines in delivering such a system.  Whilst there is much to learn by looking at the strengths and weaknesses apparent in aspects of other countries&rsquo; pension systems, there is no blueprint for reform that Ireland can implement directly and any solution must be tailored to fit the Irish situation.  To this end, consultations have been conducted and more are planned with consumers, representatives of employers, trade unions, the pensions industry and advocate\/interest groups as well as a range of Irish and international experts in this field.  Any decisions by Government will also be informed by the conclusions of the recent consultation process undertaken by the Pensions Authority aimed at developing measures to reform and simplify the wider pensions system. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400067#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400067#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[36755\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400067#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a review of a disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>I can confirm that this lady is currently in receipt of disability allowance.

To ensure that these targets are met, managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is\u00a0a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department.\u00a0 The\u00a0drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.\u00a0 In this regard, the voted expenditure report published with the end-October Exchequer statement outlines that gross voted expenditure of &euro;44,219 million to end-October was &euro;795 million (1.8%) below profile.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Expenditure Report 2017,\u00a0total gross voted expenditure for 2016 is now estimated at &euro;56.1 billion.  This is 0.6 per cent higher than the level set out in the Estimates for 2016.  This increase in expenditure\u00a0reflects an additional &euro;200 million of capital funding for necessary repair work to transport infrastructure arising from flood damage at the start of the year and\u00a0expenditure arising on\u00a0school building works.  In addition, an amount of &euro;220 million is included to fund a Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients.  In line with previous years, it is anticipated that the additional cost of providing this bonus will be offset by year-end savings across a number of Departments.  The Christmas Bonus will be funded through both voted expenditure and the Social Insurance Fund.  In addition, since publication of the Expenditure Report 2017, given the need to respond proactively to growing uncertainties for Irish based enterprise, additional funding is to be allocated to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in 2016.  This additional funding, which by fast-tracking the delivery of certain spending programmes in 2016 through an increased 2016 allocation, should provide the space for increased spending on Brexit initiatives in 2017 within the allocation for 2017 agreed at Budget time.  All of these additional amounts will be\u00a0reflected in the Supplementary Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of the under-spend versus profile at the end of October and the level of savings surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of 2015, it is expected that all Supplementary Estimates can be accommodated within the overall gross voted expenditure amount of &euro;56.1 billion set out in the Expenditure Report 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure Report 2017 sets out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58 billion in 2017.  This represents a year on year increase of under 3&frac12;%.  This represents a prudent level of increase as we continue to repair the public finances.  However, we have to be mindful of the considerable expenditure pressures facing the public finances and it is important that we continue to evaluate how we spend our money to ensure that limited resources provide much needed public services and social infrastructure.  Given this context, I announced on Budget day that a spending review will be carried out in advance of Budget 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Given the many competing priorities and demands for resources, there is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and\u00a0that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.\u00a0 The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).\u00a0 We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services.\u00a0 When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.\u00a0 It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates\u00a0in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased staff numbers reflected in the budgetary allocations for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a strategic review of infrastructural requirements was undertaken by my Department as part of last year's capital review.  This resulted in the publication in September 2015 of 'Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021', which outlined a &euro;42bn framework for infrastructural investment across Ireland.  The Plan prioritises spending on what were considered to be the areas of greatest need as the economy continues its strong recovery.  There will be a review of Government priorities within the Capital Plan in the context of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan which I announced at Budget-time last month. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400068#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400068#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[36714\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400068#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which the various agreements such as the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements remain intact in terms of public expenditure and savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, agreement was reached between public service staff representatives and public service employers\u00a0to extend the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016\u00a0(Haddington Road Agreement).

The Census asks respondents to declare their Principal Economic Status (PES), which classifies their usual situation with regard to employment, and includes the categories of employed and unemployed, amongst others. A detailed analysis of the change in 'PES' between 2011 and 2016 will be available at county level and below when the 2016 Census results are published in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400069#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[36823\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400069#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of full-time and part-time public sector workers in each of the years 2005 to 2015 in tabular form.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>The\u00a0following table presents data on full and part time workers in the Civil Service (including traditional part-time - i.e. 50% of full-time - and other work sharing patterns) from end 2006 to Q2, 2016.

It is expected that this mid-term review will be completed in 2017.  My Department published an eHealth strategy in 2013 which highlighted the opportunity for providing for a digital infrastructure to support health and social care to improve health delivery efficiency and underpin patient safety.  The strategy also recognised the need for further investment in healthcare Information and Communications Technology and while significant improvement in the capital spending for ICT in health since 2012 has taken place, further investment will be required into the future and this is recognised in the Programme for Government.  In recent months the HSE has submitted a business case for a national electronic health care record for Ireland which will provide for a digital platform across the acute, community and primary care areas allowing the connectivity necessary to support models of integrated care.  It is envisaged that the first acute hospital setting for an electronic health record will be the New Children's Hospital.

This review will be comprehensive, assessing current and necessary future bed capacity in hospitals as well as psychiatric, community, nursing home, long stay and rehabilitation beds. <\/p>  <p>  Further, the &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo;, which has provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness, became operational in October, 2016.  The Initiative sets out a comprehensive range of actions, across primary, community and hospital services, to increase hospital avoidance measures, facilitate timely discharge from hospital and increase hospital capacity.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Winter Initiative, 18 step-down beds have opened in the Mercy Hospital in Cork.  The HSE have advised that 28 of 55 additional acute hospital beds are expected to open in November\/December.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400072#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400072#WRM01600"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[36825\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400072#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical cards as of 1 November 2016;

This meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.   <\/p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Scheme.  Developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150m, it will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.  This is a cash flow support facility to improve the working capital position of viable primary agriculture SMEs, including farmers.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  Last week I welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.broadband.gov.ie<\/font><\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As you will see from the Map Belcarra, County Mayo\u00a0largely falls within a BLUE area and\u00a0will be covered by commercial operators.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and \u00a0entering their Eircode.\u00a0\u00a0Based on information provided by one commercial operator I understand that high speed broadband services is available to some 310 premises from the Belcarra exchange and that work on a further 185 premises has been completed and rollout is planned for these premises in early 2017.  This is however a matter for the company in question. <\/p><p>While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises,\u00a0the NBP aims to ensure that all premises can access high speed broadband.\u00a0 My Department is therefore closely monitoring the rollout of services in the BLUE area, including Belcarra.  I would encourage<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>consumers in\u00a0Belcarra who\u00a0cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">broadband@dccae.gov.ie<\/font><\/i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services<font color=\"#1F497D\">.\u00a0 T<\/font>his information will assist the Department in keeping track of progress in those areas.  If\u00a0it transpires that some premises will not be connected by the commercial telecoms sector, I\u00a0will consider\u00a0including them in the procurement process, as part of the State intervention. <\/p><p>My Department is now in\u00a0the formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

There are many external factors over which Ireland has no control.  Nevertheless, we have put in place policies that ensure we are anticipatory and responsive and build resilience in our enterprise base.  These policies are working.  Based on the latest CSO data released earlier this week, 189,500 additional people are at work since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs Process in 2012.  Over the last twelve months, an additional 56,500 are at work.  The unemployment rate is now down to 7.9%, from over 15.1% in 2012.  Over 72% of the additional jobs created were outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  To sustain the progress being made on job creation in the context of the UK decision to leave the EU, we have taken a number of policy and expenditure decisions, including those outlined in Budget 2017, to ameliorate the impact on Irish based enterprises and to ensure we remain on track to achieve the ambitions set out in the Programme for Government and in Enterprise 2025.  The Government will outline a full suite of measures in the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2017. <\/p>  <p>  As a policy framework, Enterprise 2025 does indeed remain relevant, in particular in the context of the events unfolding over recent months.  Enterprise 2025 sets out a framework to ensure that we have coherence across relevant government departments and complementary policies &ndash; this coherence and cross government commitment to job creation and sustainable growth remains crucial.  The actions set out in Enterprise 2025 focus on three main aspects:<\/p>  <p>  One: we are focused on achieving a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises based here in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity, and in attracting further investment;<\/p>  <p>  Two: we aim to focus investments in areas where Ireland can differentiate itself internationally &ndash; specifically education &amp;amp; skills; place-making; innovation and connectedness including trade &amp;amp; investment.  DJEI is working closely with DFAT in the development of a successor to our Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy and is engaged in the development of the successor National Planning Framework from the perspective of enterprise current and future needs;<\/p>  <p>  Three: excelling on getting the fundamentals right in terms of finance, cost competitiveness, tax environment and economic infrastructures.  The Government is confident that appropriate fiscal policies are in place that will help us to adjust to the economic effects of the UK&rsquo;s negotiated withdrawal from the EU over a period of two years or more.<\/p>  <p>  We are not blind to the potential implications arising from Brexit.  I secured additional resources in the recent Budget to support our enterprise agencies in their increased efforts to work with Irish and foreign owned companies in the context of Brexit.  In addition Budget 2017 introduced a suite of measures for agri-food, maintained strong support for the tourism sector with 9 percent VAT rate, and new schemes are under development relating to working capital.  One response may have been to reduce our ambition and the potential set out in Enterprise 2025, or to reduce the targets I set for our agencies over the coming year.  I do not believe that this would be the right response at this time. <\/p>  <p>  We will continue to focus on taking action in the right areas to support enterprise as set out in Enterprise 2025 &ndash; this does not change because of Brexit.  However, enabled by additional resources, the agencies will redouble their efforts in:<\/p>  <p> -  working with our Irish owned companies to grow scale and to compete effectively on international markets;<\/p>  <p> -  helping more Irish owned companies to export for the first time, and work with exporting companies to expand their international footprint beyond UK markets;<\/p>  <p> -  attracting FDI from a wider range of source markets &ndash; FDI that adds value to our economy;<\/p>  <p> -  helping a greater number of companies to invest in RD&amp;I for the first time and support already R&amp;D active companies to invest more in developing innovative products and services; and<\/p>  <p> -  helping locally trading companies to increase productivity, to innovate and to invest in management and skills development through the LEO network.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously we can expect that many fluctuating macro-economic, trade and employment forecasts will be produced between now and the UK leaving the European Union.  It remains to be seen precisely what the impact on the UK economy will be and much will depend on the new arrangements, including trade, to be agreed with the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, we will remain focused across Government in responding to the challenges posed by Brexit and we will not be distracted from achieving our longer term ambition for sustainable employment growth in the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400075#WRP01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400075#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[36788\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112400075#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 211 of 3 November 2016 and given that a dialogue process is under way with ICTU and IBEC to secure broad agreement before proposals are finalised in the area of zero- and low-hour contracts, the total number of meetings she has had to date with each of these social partners; the number of future meetings planned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>In addition to receiving written submissions as part of the public consultation process and subsequently, my officials have met with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) on 3 October and 3 November last, to hear their views on the draft proposals on the University of Limerick Study on the Prevalence of Zero Hours Contracts among Irish Employers and their impact on Employees.
