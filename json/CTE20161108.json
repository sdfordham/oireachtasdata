I wish the committee well in its work and hope that the institute will continue to enjoy a very positive relationship with this committee as it has done with its predecessors.<br\/><br\/>The statutory remit of the Marine Institute - I should know this by heart - is to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services related to marine research and development, that in the opinion of the Marine Institute will promote economic development, and create employment and protect the marine environment.  This mandate was further expanded to include the provision of services to support the development of the shipping and related maritime services sector through the Irish Maritime Development Office, which is a service area within the institute.<br\/><br\/>As can be seen from our annual reports, we operate under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and are governed by a board of directors under the chair of Dr. John Killeen.  The board maintains a strong focus on corporate governance and had good engagement with the executive management team, completing an annual review and update of the institute's strategic business plan in 2015, and it has recently commenced the process for the development of a new strategic plan for completion in 2017.<br\/><br\/>We provide a range of scientific and technical services to our parent Department as well as to a host of other Departments and Government agencies pertaining to Ireland's maritime domain, an area ten times the size of our terrestrial landmass.  We deliver these services through the efforts of a highly qualified and dedicated workforce of approximately 200 full-time and temporary contract staff.  We operate from world-class infrastructure including laboratory facilities in Oranmore, County Galway, and Newport, County Mayo, and the research vessels <i>RV Celtic Explorer<\/i>and <i>RV Celtic Voyager<\/i>as well as the unmanned submarine <i>Holland II<\/i>and regional offices in Dublin and key fishing harbours.<br\/><br\/>Our turnover is projected at &euro;45 million with 35% of this coming from a variety of sources outside our Vote, including competitive international research awards, charter income and funding from other Departments for service provision.  We support the implementation of the Government's integrated marine plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, through our work with the interdepartmental marine co-ordination group chaired by the Minister, Deputy Creed.  During 2015 and 2016, we have delivered key projects relating to national marine research infrastructure as well as international collaborative achievements in marine research, and a wide range of national scientific and advisory programmes.<br\/><br\/>On the research infrastructure front, we saw the successful installation in 2015 and commissioning in 2016 of Ireland's first ocean observatory in Galway Bay, with a 4 km subsea power and data cable deployed off the coast from Spiddal.  This collaboration between the institute, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SmartBay Ireland, UCC and DCU is a huge step in Ireland's marine research infrastructure.  It will enhance our ability to attract companies to develop and test ocean-energy technology in Ireland, allowing energy developers to monitor how their devices perform in the ocean, as well as providing unique real-time access to monitor ongoing changes in the marine environment including those related to climate change.<br\/><br\/>A major upgrade to the <i>RV Celtic Explorer<\/i>was carried out in 2015 and included the installation of state-of-the-art sonar systems for bathymetric mapping in deep and shallow waters and the installation of a deep-water sub-bottom profiler.<br\/><br\/>On the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance and the implementation of the Galway statement, in June 2015, an international team of seabed mapping experts led by Thomas Furey from the Marine Institute boarded the national research vessel, <i>RV Celtic Explorer<\/i>, to map a transect of the Atlantic Ocean between St. John's, Newfoundland, and Galway.  This was the first seabed mapping survey to take place under the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, a collaboration between the EU, USA and Canada, established by the Galway statement signed at the Marine Institute in May 2013.  Among the achievements of this survey was the charting of a mountain range with peaks higher than Carrauntoohil.<br\/><br\/>The Marine Institute is taking a lead role in this collaboration as the lead partner in the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance co-ordination and support action funded by EU Horizon 2020.  Further transects followed with international vessels, and the <i>RV Celtic Explorer<\/i>did a further transect in 2016.  Work is at an advanced stage with an international seabed mapping working group to prepare a campaign mapping the entire north Atlantic with the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance partners.  Ireland is regarded as a world leader in this arena in light of the national seabed-mapping programme led by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute.<br\/><br\/>Significant EU research funding has been leveraged by EU research organisations to support the implementation of the Galway statement with approximately &euro;140 million invested in a range of projects to date from Horizon 2020.  Major alignment efforts with Canadian and USA national funding programmes have been achieved.  Canada announced an unprecedented $220 million investment in an Atlantic Oceans Frontier Institute during September.  This is a collaboration between universities in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.  The Marine Institute is one of a very select group of international partners in this initiative.<br\/><br\/>Ireland continues to perform excellently in the marine-related funding programmes of Horizon 2020.  To date, Irish researchers, including those in the Marine Institute, have secured between 4.5% and 5% of available funds which is several times the expected <i>pro rata<\/i>earnings by Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We worked closely with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, operational programme for Ireland, particularly on developing biodiversity and data collection schemes.  The EMFF operational programme was launched in January 2016 and the Marine Institute was allocated funding of &euro;36 million for the new data collection framework until 2020.  This will support the largest fishery scientific efforts in the history of the State during the period of the programme.  Further important programmes were established under the EMFF integrated maritime policy element to support the work of the interagency marine development team to be established in the Marine institute-IMDO; and to support the provision of technical and scientific services from the Marine Institute to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which has the lead role in the establishment of marine spatial planning in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We maintained a strong focus on the delivery of key scientific services, including seafood safety, providing scientific and technical advice to the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, carrying out a range of monitoring programmes to support the EU legislation including the marine strategy framework directive, the water framework directive and the EU data collection multiannual programme.  Retention and expansion of our laboratory accreditation ISO certification has been important to ensure the highest quality in all scientific and regulatory advisory services.<br\/><br\/>Our role in ensuring the safety of Irish seafood involves supporting the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland by monitoring farmed finfish product to ensure residues of treatment chemicals are below regulatory limits; farmed and wild shellfish for the incidence of potentially harmful microbiological agents such as E. coli and norovirus, and biotoxins; and Irish waters for the incidence and prevalence of harmful algal blooms and environmental contaminants, with contaminant analyses also supporting EU requirements under the water framework directive and the marine strategy framework directive.<br\/><br\/>The Marine Institute houses three national reference laboratories for diseases of finfish, molluscs and crustaceans, and is the competent authority for ensuring compliance with fish health regulations.  We also support marine research nationally through our research and funding office and by providing access to the national research vessels, <i>RV Celtic Explorer<\/i>and <i>RV Celtic Voyager<\/i>through the ship-time funding programme.<br\/><br\/>We produce an annual stock book which contains the latest scientific advice on those stocks fished by the Irish fleet.  This was delivered to the Minister in November 2015 and was a key component of his sustainability assessment presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in December 2015.  It was also at the heart of the negotiations at the EU Council of Ministers in December, which set fishing opportunities for 2016.<\/p><p>We look forward to this year's discussions with the committee in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> We provide significant support for education and training across scientific disciplines and in the maritime and seafarers domain each year through programmes such as the strategic marine alliance for research and training, SMART, and the Irish seafarers education assistance scheme, ISEAS, in partnership with a range of higher education institutions.  We launched the Cullen fellowship programme in 2015 that provides research and training opportunities for scientists in marine and related disciplines leading to masters and PhD degrees.  We also target programmes at primary level, such as the Follow the Fleet and the Explorers Education Programme, as well as secondary levels, with targeted local science festival participation, school visits to the national research vessels and an open day at our Oranmore headquarters for transition year students annually.  We are expanding our use of video content to bring our work and the importance of our shared marine resource to a wider audience.  This includes the Galway Bay ocean energy test site and ocean observatory and the transatlantic seabed mapping survey.<\/p><p> The Marine Institute supports the work of the marine co-ordination group and the implementation of the integrated marine plan, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, HOOW.  This involved the provision of key support services for the work of task forces, the preparation of the annual progress reports and organising the major national Our Ocean Wealth Conference, now in its third year and attracting over 400 delegates annually, and the public engagement event SeaFest.  I recommend that members attend the conference on 30 June 2017.  The Marine Institute will house and manage the soon-to-be-formed marine development team, a team created to work collaboratively across development agencies and Departments to achieve the ambitions set out by the Government in the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth plan.<\/p><p> Recent independent economic reports on the performance of the Irish marine economy indicate it is outperforming the general economy and on course to achieve the HOOW turnover target of &euro;6.4 billion by 2020.  Turnover growth from 2010 to 2012 was from &euro;3.1 billion to &euro;4.2 billion, with a continued estimated trend to &euro;4.5 billion to 2014.  The recent OECD report published this year indicates the anticipated growth trends across the global marine economy from its current level at $1.5 trillion to an estimated $3 trillion in 2030;  it is important that Ireland continues to work in an integrated manner in order to take best advantage of global growth projections.<\/p><p> Under the aegis of the marine co-ordination group and as part of the implementation of Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, a major marine festival to generate public engagement about Ireland&rsquo;s marine domain was created.  In its first year of 2015, it drew 10,000 visitors to Ringaskiddy in Cork and last year in Galway it grew to over 60,000 visitors.  Plans are well under way for 2017 events in Galway from 28 June to 2 July across a campus stretching from NUI Galway to the harbour area.  Again, I take the opportunity to encourage committee members to participate.  The new national marine research and innovation strategy is a key action for the Marine Institute under the integrated marine plan.  There is also preparation of a new national marine research and innovation strategy for 2021.  This has been prepared in consultation with the marine co-ordination group and is now open to an online public consultation process in November.  We aim to complete the strategy by the year-end, if feasible, depending on the scale of public consultation.  We welcome the views of the committee on the draft plan.<\/p><p> On climate change and oceans, we can consider that half the oxygen we get in every breath we take has been produced by microscopic plants floating in the ocean surface layers and that 97% of all the water on this planet has its \"reservoir\" in our oceans, so one can begin to grasp the critical importance of a healthy ocean to the planet's life support system.  Our weather and climate are hugely dependent on the interactions of the Atlantic Ocean and the atmosphere.  With the reality of the serious challenges posed by climate change and its impacts both on the oceans and coastal nations such as Ireland, the Marine Institute is redoubling its efforts to participate in national, European and global scientific programmes to generate fit-for-purpose capability to forecast the major changes in our oceans and help mitigate their impacts.  We also participate in climate action groups with the Department and interdepartmental and agency climate-related scientific committees and advisory bodies.  We anticipate a significant societal demand for enhanced scientific capacity in this arena in the years immediately ahead.  One of the major reports to be produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change next year will deal with the interactions between the oceans and cryosphere.<\/p><p> Brexit poses significant challenges and complex issues for the entire marine economy.  The institute will place a high priority on supporting our parent Department with scientific advisory services in the period ahead as the Department continues to deepen its analyses of the likely impacts on the fisheries sector.  In addition, through the work of the Irish Marine Development Office, we will continue to assist the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in forming a comprehensive understanding of the likely impacts of Brexit on our shipping, ports and transport sectors, as well as the consequential impact on international trade.  This in turn supports our parent Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as they feed into the central contingency framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p><p> Recognising the contribution and quality of Marine Institute staff, the board, together with the executive management team, made employee engagement a key ongoing priority objective.  A Great Place To Work survey of staff was carried out, as well as a culture audit, and a number of initiatives were introduced focusing on enhancing employee engagement.  We have also achieved and maintained Excellence Through People standard accreditation in human resource management and this has been held continuously since 2005.  This accreditation complements the wide range of laboratory-based scientific services that are accredited by internationally recognised accreditation bodies.  Staffing levels were a significant pressure point for the organisation, particularly during the latter stages of the recent economic crisis, when they reached critical levels.  Through the dedication and sustained effort of the staff of the institute, we managed to maintain and in some instances increase core service delivery programmes throughout the very challenging climate of cutbacks and staffing embargoes.  The institute continues to liaise with Department to address critical competency and capacity gap areas in the context of the work force planning framework in the public sector.  We have seen some limited but very welcome recruitment from Exchequer resources in recent times and we have benefited to a greater degree from capacity growth funded from external competitive funding sources.<\/p><p> The Marine Institute has recently been honoured by two international awards.  In September, we received the International Co-operation Project award from Commissioner Vella, DG MARE, for our role as co-ordinators of the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance Co-ordination and Support Action.  Tomorrow, we will be the recipients of The Maritime Alliance - based in San Diego -  International Maritime Partner award in recognition of the Marine Institute&rsquo;s role in the creation and ongoing promotion of the SmartOcean Cluster in Ireland, which is a cluster of marine technology and ICT-based services companies and research centres.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee will appreciate from the above that the Marine Institute is a dynamic, internationally recognised organisation that provides a wide variety of services to our diverse clients.  I look forward to the opportunity to discuss matters of interest with the committee and to working with it in the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Heffernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for a very comprehensive opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>One of the responsibilities of the Marine Institute is to evaluate the environmental impact studies relating to aquaculture licensing.

One of the great delaying and frustrating factors for everybody involved in the arena in recent years has been the judgment against Ireland in the context of compliance with EU legislation.  Ireland found itself on the wrong side of an EU court judgment, which meant that Ireland had to undertake a significant body of new science surveying bay by bay across every area that was designated under those special areas of conservation, SACs, or special protection areas, SPAs.  That took a very significant scientific lift during the worst period of the fiscal crisis.  However, I am glad to say that by the scientific effort on the part of the institute, in partnership with several other agencies - including the Department's agencies represented here today and the National Parks and Wildlife Service - we provided the scientific basis for the creation of appropriate assessments, which was a critical step against the conservation objective.  The provision of those assessments bay by bay allows the licensing authority with confidence to deal with the license application and the progressive backlog.  We will have the vast bulk of all that work completed in the fiscal year ahead, which will cover the vast bulk of licensed activity pending or seeking renewal.  The backlog has been a significant source of frustration for everybody involved on the State side and the private sector side of planning for agriculture.  There is a very significant body of support in this regard, and I am sure BIM will articulate that in the context of support for agriculture developments in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, programme in the period ahead.  We are nearing the end of that tunnel of the pipeline of provision of appropriate assessments across all the key bay areas.<br\/><br\/>The key role the institute provides in the issue of coastal erosion is the operation of a coastal data buoy network.  Buoys M1 to M5 and M7 are <i>in situ<\/i>providing real-time, hourly, satellite-transmitted information on the state of the oceans.  We are increasingly building an integrated digital ocean picture from a multitude of data sources - fisheries, environmental and coastal.  We seek to be and will be increasingly strong partners in the national effort for long-term flood forecasting led by the OPW, in partnership with Met &Eacute;ireann, with which we operate the data buoy network.  We are very ambitious about the development of an Irish capacity to be in a global leadership position.  We argue that that is the capacity Ireland requires, given the scale of our marine resources, to understand what is being driven by climate change, what are natural challenges and the scale of the risks and how to mitigate those risks, be it coastal erosion, shifting of fish stocks or opportunities created by the changes.<br\/><br\/>One thing is certain: things are changing in the ocean and they are changing more quickly than predictions, not only for fish stocks but also for the survival of life on this planet.  Mankind needs to know that.  One of the benefits of the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance is that the scale of the scientific undertaking is bigger than any one country but that, because of the Galway statement, the EU, Canada and the US are all aligned to work together on the big lift.  If I were to simplify it, I would say it is a question of mapping it and observing it.  It is worth thinking, for example, how much we take for granted in how we are able to observe with the aid of satellites.  One can see one's back garden with the aid of satellites but one cannot see a mile under the sea floor.  A satellite cannot penetrate the ocean.  It can give one a picture of the ocean surface, the surface layers and the temperature and brilliant scientists are able to turn those temperature readings into an image of the sea floor.  However, the work on the transect from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Galway showed last year that a mountain on the sea floor was inaccurate on a vertical scale by between 1 km and 2 km and east to west or north to south by 2 km plus.  Over &pound;120 million was the original award for the contracts for the search for the Malaysian airliner which went down on 8 March 2014 and which has still not been located.  The search area has been increased by 50%.  The search company's gear hit a volcano and the company lost that gear because it did not know the volcano was in front of it.  These are among the best survey companies.<br\/><br\/>If water is taken away, the sea floor constitutes 70% of the surface of this planet, and less than 10% of it has been mapped.  However, Ireland is a world leader in mapping its marine territory and is so recognised.  It is great to go to international meetings at which Ireland is held up as the poster boy or girl for being able to do this.  We kept it alive with funding through the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources through the worst of the fiscal crisis because there was a real sense that this was an achievement by Ireland against a very tough backdrop.<br\/><br\/>For coastal erosion, the build-up of the science capacity and the integrated digital systems is important.  I mentioned the seabed cable in Galway Bay.  That is a very important first investment by Ireland to be a leader in playing in that big arena and to be able to make forecasts about the ocean.  The ocean will influence every sector, be it shellfish, safety, salmon production, mackerel or herring.  Nature will push us around a lot more than we will push it around, so we need to understand it.  It is a big piece of real estate with a huge volume of water in it.  We have a lot to offer regarding coastal erosion, but not exclusively in university centres such as the UCC centre, which is world-class and does fantastic work on design.<\/p><p>I would say most piers and harbour protection plans were designed or modelled there in tanks that model ocean energy devices for prototype developers.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue asked about the nature of the challenges.  Any agency could come in here and tell members it needed more resources, but set against the scale of Ireland's marine territory, a quantum step in our investment is justified and it would return to us.  An independently verified cost-benefit analysis on the seabed mapping exercise shows a return of between four and six times the original investment.  Creating knowledge and being able to use that knowledge pay back big time.  Given the scale of Ireland's resources, progressing the economic objectives in the integrated marine plan to get to the figure of &euro;6.4 billion will justify increased investment by the State when resources permit.<\/p><p> We have had to adapt to, react to and live with the reality of the fiscal crisis and I commend the team around me, and the staff at the institute, on the way they have demonstrated their ability to keep their cutting edge and to keep winning European money when the system did not even allow us to employ people with 100% funding from such resources.  We are in an era in which there is a welcome delegated sanction mechanism to replace the public sector.  We are competing very well for resources and creating employment opportunities and these are the primary initial pathways to growth.  We await the outcome of budget Estimates and provisions for next year.<\/p><p> My colleague will comment on the specifics on some of the work being done on the fish stocks.  Brexit will afford many more challenges than opportunities.  In some niches there may be opportunities, but we have many successful partnerships with Scottish, Welsh, English and Northern Irish bodies and they are very important to our scientific work as it is structured at the moment.  They are important for the work done through EU reference labs on, for example, seafood safety, and we are going to have to watch what happens very carefully.  We are doing a lot of analysis on the potential impact and we will be very busy in the years ahead in supporting several Departments with scientific advice, analysis and assessments as to the various ways it could play out.  There was a question on the potential for a partner in a research proposal to be lost to us.  EU-based scientists are worrying about how welcome they will be as leaders of research proposals within the EU or with a big partner if there is a risk to their eligibility or if their eligibility criteria remain unknown while negotiations are happening.

Dr. Heffernan said the institute was nearing the end of the assessment stages, but how near the end is it?  There are 90 bays.  Once data collection is completed and appropriate conservation objectives are set, there will be a requirement for the process to start again and for the science to be updated.  Has that been thought about?  Has the way the project is going to work into the future been considered?  One of the difficulties was that there were three agencies, the National  Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute and the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, and nobody really took ownership of the process or co-ordinated and drove it.  Does Dr. Heffernan agree that this needs to happen in the future?  There will be a need to update the science for each of the bays.  What planning has there been around that?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Heffernan also mentioned the Irish Maritime Development Office which was set up to provide services to support the development of the shipping related maritime services sector.  Will he expand on its role?  How will it interact with the Marine Survey Office in certifying seafarers?  Does he see a role for the institute in terms of the many farmer-fishermen who have left fishing and gained certification in England, through the MCA, to work on offshore wind energy construction but who do not have equivalency here in terms of the recognition of qualifications?  Is there an opportunity for the institute to develop something along those lines?<\/p> <p>  On the question of the Galway Bay offshore renewable research centre, what is SmartBay Ireland and what is the relationship between SmartBay Ireland and the Marine Institute?  How will the relationship develop?  There appears to be a lot of concern in Galway that a 35-year lease has been sought for the site, leading to a degree of permanency in offshore renewable energy construction.

Our ocean wealth is underdeveloped in comparison to Scotland and Scandinavian countries.  There are concerns as to the environmental impact of aquaculture and fish farms off the coast and as to the sustainability of our wild fish stock.  Inland Fisheries Ireland raised concerns about the impact of fish farms passing diseases onto returning wild salmon.  What is the position of the Marine Institute on this?  The concerns are legitimate because inshore angling is very important and it is very important to conserve fish stocks.  Dr. Heffernan said many issues were at play but some of the material online about the environmental fallout from fish farms causes great concern.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that onshore, rather than offshore, fish farms are preferable because it is easier to contain their environmental impact.  Can we not try to take this approach?  On ocean and wave energy, can the witnesses say how we compare to the work being done in Scotland?  I believe Scotland is far ahead of us.  Every time we try to develop a wind farm in this country, we are told to put it offshore or develop ocean energy.  What costs are involved in ocean energy and how feasible is it?  The Marine Institute has to take economic considerations into its work.  How close are we to developing this?  The most economically viable renewable energies are supported but they are still not as cheap as fossil fuels.  How far are we from ocean energies becoming viable and coming into the mainstream to feed our national grid?  Is it a long time away?  How advanced are they in Scotland?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Connolly said he would return to us with further information.  Is this in respect of the aquaculture review?  I understand the Department was undertaking a review, or perhaps the Marine Institute was doing so on the Department's behalf.

If we do not take account of environmental issues, we do not have sustainability and things do not last, meaning we pay a price in the long term.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses give an update on what is envisaged for the seaweed industry and seaweed harvesting?

If they are outside the Common Fisheries Policy, this will be a big question.  Might there be a Norwegian-style scenario in which the UK will tie in with EU policy on common fisheries?

The Deputy asked what is left to be done in terms of appropriate assessments by bay.  The number of relevant licences is diminishing the priority of licences.  In terms of scientific lift, the back of it is broken.  By year end, the estimates from the figures before me are that the vast bulk of it will be done.<\/p> <p>  The question on the updating is a very pertinent one.  It is something we will engage in.  I assure the Deputy and the committee that, as the service provider for carrying out the appropriate assessments, I felt very co-ordinated, very pushed and the team, the demand and pressure to get the work done was there constantly.  It was a national exercise.  We were in a bad place in terms of a court judgment so there was no easy out.  The scrutiny level from Europe was very large and the wriggle room was very minimal.

It has been applied for on a 35-year basis.  The 35-year term is explained on the basis that the overarching plan nationally, the Ocean Energy Development Plan, is couched in a 35-year timeframe.  The infrastructure that was invested in by Science Foundation Ireland and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in creating the test tank facility in the centre of excellence in Cork is predicated on the 35-year basis.

The science we undertake ourselves is very much focused on the services we provide which are very much at the interface of the governance of resource development, its sustainability and supporting its sustainable development.

We are involved in predictive systems working with shellfish farmers all over the country over the years investing in both the nationally funded and EU funded programmes that are progressively increasing our ability to predict.  The ideal scenario is that the farmer gets advice that the next three or four days or week, for example, are looking bad and if the farmer can get the product out of the water body, he or she can still get it on the market.

In certain quarters, there is an ongoing and very real concern about fin fish aquaculture.  The Marine Institute's opinion is that current practices in fin fish aquaculture in Ireland are at the forefront of sustainability and we are securing a very high value for organic and wild production of a modest tonnage in fin fish farming.

Ireland, bar no place on the planet, has the best combined advantage of wave energy, offshore wind energy and, to a lesser degree, tidal energy.  The published projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland give testament to this.  The sequence of what is likely to be commercially viable is: first, tidal; second, offshore wind; and third, wave.  This week, an Irish company is deploying a tidal turbine system which is potentially the most advanced in the world, in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, which has the largest tidal surge on the planet.  There is an Irish company at the forefront.  The Senator has rightly pointed out that the Orkney Islands are enjoying a potential leadership role in their wave energy test site.  However, it is on an offshore island.  Ireland will be increasingly competitive with the integrated package from the university based system in Cork, the quarter scale system in Galway Bay and the full scale system off Belmullet in Mayo.  We will be able to compete for those technology developers.  Only in the past week, an Irish based company is developing a quarter scale prototype in Galway Bay on the quarter scale test site, having taken it through the whole development system from Cork.  It was manufactured in Shannon Foynes and deployed locally.<\/p><p>I may be corrected if I am wrong, but I think the estimates are &euro;1.5 to &euro;2 million circulated within the Irish economy with each prototype that gets to the quarter scale.<\/p><p> On the seaweed industry, the issue of rights and protection is a licensing issue and beyond the scope of the Marine Institute.  We have invested, continue to invest and will continue to invest in the science around sustainability and harvesting techniques alone and in partnership with other agencies.  We look at the added value and biotechnology potential of seaweeds, which is very strong.  It is not only seaweeds, but a lot of other deep water ocean organisms and there is a significant body of research funded in Ireland to compete internationally in that arena.  We partner with other funding entities nationally and internationally on that.

The invitation specifically referenced a wish to speak about issues concerning the fishing industry and our annual report for 2014.  In that regard, I should note that our annual report for 2015 has been signed off and is being translated.  It will be available to the committee when laid before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  On the issues concerning the fishing industry, the most significant live issue for the sector, like many others, is Brexit; specifically how an island nation with a tradition of sharing waters with the United Kingdom will operate effectively after its departure from the European Union.  We are not yet in a position to know for certain, but it is clear that a hard Brexit scenario would place huge pressure on the Irish fleet by removing a huge section of its fishing grounds.  Like most other observers, we must await the shape the UK exit negotiations will take and see how the Common Fisheries Policy will interpret Brexit.<\/p> <p>  While decisions on Brexit are matters for the Government, BIM is contributing to an inter-agency and departmental group on the issue - the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee.  BIM is supporting the industry through economic analysis and mapping the supply chain for the top five performing species in our key markets to establish price margins at every point of the chain and how we can use this information to minimise the effects of Brexit in these categories.  From a market perspective, it is important to note that the industry has faced many challenges in the recent past, including that presented by the Russian ban on imports in 2014 and the massive fall in demand from our largest non-EU market, Nigeria, which accounted for 46% of fish exports in 2015.  It is a testament to the resilience of the industry that we surmounted these challenges, with exports increasing by 7% to &euro;564 million last year and the domestic market up 6% to &euro;350 million.  The Irish seafood sector is performing well and, in addition to the UK market, we have strong sales in the European Union, at &euro;388 million; Nigeria and north Africa, at &euro;98 million; and Asia, at &euro;47 million.<\/p> <p>  To provide some perspective on the global opportunity, seafood is and has been on trend for some time.  The macro drivers supporting consumer decisions are all in our favour &ndash; a growing population, an incessant drive towards healthy natural foods, a need for convenience, a demand for sustainability and traceability pressurising other protein choices.  There is scope for considerable growth, with the global demand for seafood projected to grow by 50% by 2030.  By 2050 the world&rsquo;s population will be more than 9 billion, 34% higher than today, and we are increasingly turning to the sea for a protein rich and healthy food solution.<\/p> <p>  While Irish seafood contributes &euro;1 billion in GDP to the national economy, the sector is not currently structured to leverage all of the drivers to the maximum.  Improvements are, therefore, required in the industry.  We know that it is fragmented at every level of the supply chain and that in many sectors there is an effective cap on production.  We also know that we must attract talent to the industry, that we should be leveraging our work on sustainability more, that we should be doing more to communicate that point of difference to international markets and that we could and should add more value to our catch and aspire to working with higher margins.  While knowing all of this puts us some of the way on the path to a solution, we have some distance to travel.<\/p> <p>  In the past year BIM has focused on developing an integrated and strategic approach to core priorities for the agency and the industry.  We have further developed partnerships with our sister agencies and outside expertise in order to deliver that streamlined approach and are engaging more effectively with our most important audiences, the sea fisheries and aquaculture sectors, to articulate our integrated approach.  That approach is based on the identification and prioritisation of four pillars of focus for the delivery of our services - skills, sustainability, innovation and competitiveness.  Each seeks to address a priority issue for the sector: addressing the skill needs of the industry and developing a pool of talent through training; building added value through the creation of a lexicon for sustainability; looking for opportunities to add more value to our product through innovation; and seeking to capture and optimise the value available in the market through greater competitiveness.  Each and every pillar is related, interconnected and, to a certain degree, dependent on the other. <\/p> <p>  Let me begin with the issue of skills.  Traditionally BIM has delivered training to fishing communities through its two colleges in Greencastle and Castletownbere, as well as through mobile coastal training units.  This year we will deliver 207 courses in 25 locations, catering for some 1,700 students.  While this is a significant effort, we know that more is needed.  To date, we have been focused on the technical skills required to operate in the industry, but we realise we must also address the provision of business skills, innovation skills and sustainability skills to ensure we support the businessmen and women who are seeking to grow the industry.  We are looking to develop a talent pipeline that will offer the industry relevant and recognised qualifications to support its needs from boat to farm to factory to shop.<\/p> <p>  With our objective to upskill and develop a systematic approach to training provision, improving safety at sea continues to be a priority for BIM.  With commercial fishing universally acknowledged as one of the most hazardous professions in the world, BIM developed and has successfully implemented the enhanced safety scheme, a programme of grant aid towards safety training and new innovative personal flotation devices, PFDs, with integrated personal locator beacons, PLBs.  Under this highly successful scheme, over 1,600 fishermen have been trained to date.  There is sanctioned grant aid for 1,546 PFDs with integrated PLBs.  To further promote the programme and encourage fishermen to wear PFDs while at sea, BIM initiated a major award winning safety awareness advertising and public relations campaign in January this year.  Entitled \"Live to Tell the Tale\", the campaign was born out of the stark fact that 53 fishermen and fisherwomen had lost their lives at sea in the past ten years and that last year alone four fishermen had lost their lives at sea.  Our research showed that despite more than 52% of fishermen personally knowing someone who had been lost at sea, over half of them did not wear a personal flotation device and that many of them could not swim.  As a result of the campaign which featured real fishermen David Massey and Gerald Copeland, the number of training places increased by 23%.  Thankfully, to date in 2016, we have had the lowest rate of fatalities at sea in the fisheries sector and, through the numbers enrolled on courses and signing up for PFDs, we believe we have helped to prompt a seismic change in attitude in the fishing community.<\/p> <p>  Our second pillar focuses on sustainability.<\/p><p>Sustainability has become a critical requirement for accessing higher premium markets and doing business with global food businesses.  Working in partnership with Bord Bia's Origin Green charter is central to our sustainability agenda.  We have aligned all our environmental management systems and accreditations for aquaculture, fisheries and processing to the Origin Green programme and our robust standards are a first stage of entry to Origin Green, ensuring that our industry is demonstrating high standards in responsible fishing, green processing and environmental management systems for aquaculture.<\/p><p> In fisheries, we are in a time of great change, with the implementation of the landing obligation and a stated desire to move to maximum sustainable yields on all our stocks by 2020.  BIM is driving the agenda in terms of studies on new fishing gear technologies that will work in line with the landing obligation to improve sustainability and fishing effort.<\/p><p> Our third area of focus is innovation.  We are looking to drive a cultural shift in industry in this space.  Innovation is a catch-all word that can have lots of different meanings.  Often, however, it is limited to adding value to products.  I would like us to be more adventurous when it comes to innovation.  Innovation is an attitude and a behaviour.  It is examining the things that we do everyday and challenging ourselves on how to do them better and differently.  Innovation has a place in every part of the supply chain and our businesses.<\/p><p> We have an excellent infrastructure in place to deliver expertise and technology to industry through BIM's Seafood Development Centre, SDC, in Clonakilty.  This facility is now offering seafood companies access to in-house seafood technologists to develop new and innovative products and packaging without having to commit to capital investment.  We have also further developed our research capability this year with Irish and international partnerships, including Teagasc and Nofima, a Norwegian research agency.  We are considering a ten-year plan to build our research capability in BIM and the SDC to offer industry the best Irish and international research insights that will drive their business.<\/p><p> Competitiveness is about supporting the creation of value and the attainment of maximum sustainable profitability.  BIM is systematically examining the essential conditions, or the natural endowments of our sector to achieve growth.  Four categories have been identified to help grow competitiveness: business environment; physical infrastructure; clusters and firm sophistication; and knowledge and talent.<\/p><p> Let me focus on clusters and relevant partnerships as one of the ways to build our capability in this area.  Our China council, in partnership with Bord Bia, has created a framework for discussion.  We are also in ongoing discussions with Teagasc to understand the learnings from producer groups in farming and with Norwegian research agency Nofima to benchmark our industry against the external community.  Transparency of information and open communication channels will be key to improving and making progress in this space.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the four pillars to which I have alluded are not the panacea to all the external issues that can affect this industry, but I am confident that they will provide a clear route to achieving the ambitious growth targets set out for the sector in the Government's Food Wise 2025 report and Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth: An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland.  The vision that we have signed up to is Ireland as the international leader in high value differentiated seafood products that satisfy growing domestic and international demand for nutritious, safe, responsibly and sustainably produced food.  This is an attractive vision.  Realising it will require investment.<\/p><p> The Government has clearly demonstrated its support for achieving the ambitions of the sector with an increase in BIM's annual budget from &euro;18.5 million in 2014 to &euro;39 million in 2016.  This increase is largely as a result of the &euro;241 million seafood development plan to be delivered under the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, EMFF, which will include a range of support measures for the Irish fishing, processing and aquaculture sectors.  Only last week, we saw the announcement of &euro;12 million funding under the EMFF operational programme to seven fisheries local action groups, FLAGs.  These groups, dotted around our coastline, comprise local actors from the fisheries and aquaculture sectors and others with a strong interest in fostering the development of our coastal communities.  The funding will be available to the FLAGs over the four-year period from 2017 to 2021 and is an eight-fold increase on the &euro;1.5 million that was available under the previous scheme.  As the State agency responsible for providing a range of administrative and technical supports to the FLAGs, we were delighted with the significant increase in funding for the programme.<\/p><p> BIM will also administer and manage the funds for a range of grant aid schemes under the EMFF, including &euro;3.4 million to 27 seafood processing companies under the seafood capital investment scheme towards a total investment of &euro;19.4 million.<\/p><p> At BIM, we share the collective vision for Ireland to become the international leader in high-value, differentiated seafood products that satisfy growing domestic and international demand for healthy, safe and responsibly and sustainably sourced seafood.  There was never a more opportune time in which to drive that agenda forward.  At BIM, the State has a dedicated and talented workforce with a high level of technical expertise that continues to deliver specialist and vital supports to the fisheries sector.  We have a clearly defined and integrated strategy built on the solid foundation of the four pillars.  At Government and Department level, we have the policy support.  With the EMFF, through the European Commission, we have the resources.  The market opportunity is there.  The vision is articulated.  The plan is agreed and the budget is secured.  We must now continue to work diligently to deliver on our promise for the benefit of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy.

I will start with Brexit, which will probably be the burning issue for the next three or four years.  It has two aspects in this regard, one of which is access to fishing waters in terms of the allocation of quota and so on.  There has been a great deal of talk about a hard Brexit, but the UK's fishing industry will still have to access waters outside its own.  A hard Brexit has the potential to have a negative impact on its industry and, similarly, ours.  A Norwegian arrangement is likely, whereby there are negotiations every year and a quota sharing arrangement is place.  Is this Ms McCarthy's view of what will happen post a hard, soft or middle Brexit?  There would have to be some sort of negotiation.  Can that arrangement exist without access to the Common Market?  The EU negotiates with Iceland and the Faroes on access to resources, albeit not successfully.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect relates to the import and export of fishery products.  We export &euro;71 million worth of fish to the UK annually, approximately 8% of our fisheries exports.  It is not very significant, although it is significant in value terms.  We import &euro;148 million worth of fish from the UK.  Regardless of whether there is a hard or soft Brexit, there should be a potential for our fisheries sector.  Has BIM considered this aspect in terms of offsetting some of the &euro;148 million in imports and how we might go about gearing up our indigenous industry to benefit?<\/p> <p>  What is BIM's assessment of the landing obligation in respect of whitefish?  The obligation is only starting to be rolled out, but how is it progressing, what are the likely challenges and how will they be addressed?<\/p> <p>  Has there been much industry engagement with the SDC in Clonakilty and the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, campus in Killybegs?  How can they develop and what is their potential?  This initiative relies a great deal on the industry engaging.<\/p> <p>  How is the National Inshore Fisheries Forum going?  Many of these bodies are fairly new.  How is the forum developing, how are inshore fishermen engaging with it and what is its potential?<\/p><p>In respect of the FLAGs, while the funding is an increase on the first tranche at &euro;1.5 million, we were extremely slow to develop fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, and only got in at the tail end of the last common fisheries fund.  How does the &euro;12 million compare with other member states and how their FLAGs are operating?  From what I see, many other states are better geared up to avail of that funding and develop it.  The FLAGs are to facilitate people who have moved out of fishing to develop alternatives.  How much can &euro;12 million leverage that over the period of the programme?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#N00400","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Tara McCarthy agus gabhaim comhghairdeas l&eacute;i as a ceapach&aacute;n.  I wish her the best in her new position.  Is Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, considering aquaculture onshore or is it doing tests to see if there is potential in that area?  I refer to a question I asked earlier of Foras na Mara.  Has the large-scale aquaculture that was envisaged for Inis Oirr gone away or is it being envisaged in another site or is such a huge offshore fish farm still on the BIM agenda?<\/p> <p>  The fishing industry is dying on its feet.  Fishermen tell me they are tied up in red tape, regulations and what they would see as the over-zealous implementation of EU directives.  Issues arising from the sub-segmentation of the tonnage and kilowatts of boats have been raised with us and these lead to safety problems.  There are fishermen in Ros an Mh&iacute;l who want to upgrade their boats but cannot because of the rules and regulations.  A boat sank off the coast of Scotland a couple of years ago.  The owners had wanted to upgrade that ship but had been held back by what they saw as EU restrictions being over-zealously implemented here and the fact that the penalty points system is very punitively exercised.<\/p> <p>  As the industry developers, one of the key partners BIM needs is the fishermen.  How is BIM addressing those issues with the industry to try to work with the State agencies to make sure they can continue fishing and that young people - who are leaving - will come into the industry?  The predecessor to this committee did a very good report on sustaining rural communities, one of whose recommendations was having a traditional licence for small-scale fishermen which would be free of quota.  Has that ever come up on BIM's agenda or is it something it would push?  There seems to be broad acceptance that the small fishermen do not impact much on quota but the paperwork involved in fishing from a small boat does affect them.  Does BIM have an input into the discussions on the quotas being implemented within the EU perspective?  When the quota is divvied up nationally, I am told the lion's share is taken up by a few big players with a small number of boats.  If that was redistributed even by a small percentage it would both benefit smaller pelagic vessels across the rest of the country, the west and south west in particular, and would feed into the fish processing industry in other coastal communities.  Does BIM have any comments on that?<\/p> <p>  We are told that the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013 is coming forward.  That is, I think, the Bill to deal with the licensing of the seaweed industry.  Has BIM been asked to comment on that because it is on the legislative programme for this session?<\/p> <p>  Mushroom companies have already gone out of business as a result of fluctuations in sterling etc.  I am sure some of the seafood producers are in an equally precarious situation and depend on British purchasers.  Does BIM have any indications from its work with the processing sector whether there are companies going to the wall or close to it?  If so, what can be done to support them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#O00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank all the members for wishing me luck in my new role.  We would agree with all the members in saying that Brexit is the biggest single challenge facing our industry.  That was why we circulated the map as part of this discussion because it shows the UK waters where we would traditionally have had complete open access and a hard Brexit would mean we would not have that access.  That is the most startling part of this issue.  Most of the food industry is talking about the effect of Brexit and access to the market.  From a fishing perspective it is more complex because it affects access to fish.  It is almost a double whammy.  Our role in the discussions on this is to understand its economics.  The Marine Institute will map and build the likely scenario for the stocks.  We then work on the economic effect of those stocks.  There may be 1,000 tonnes of stock but there is a big difference between a stock worth &euro;1 a tonne and one worth &euro;1,000 a tonne.  We also consider what stocks are important to us and which are important to the UK.  It would have been our ally in negotiations but that scenario is different now.  All we can do is build scenarios at the moment.  We can map the information flows and build negotiating positions that would be dealt with at a Heads of State level.  We will contribute to informing each member of those negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The statistics behind safety at sea are positively frightening.  The industry is much more dangerous than agriculture and the construction industry.  That is not a boast, it is a fact that we had to consider.  Our campaign was small and low budget but we tried to get to the truth of why a fisherman does not wear a safety jacket because it would seem illogical not to.  We learned that there is a perception that if the sea is going to take a fisherman, it will take him and if he falls into the water he is a goner.  A good fisherman does not fall into the water.  That was the battle we had in discussing this with fishermen.  We tried to tell them we were not trying to insult them by saying they must wear life jackets because they are not good but we asked them to live to tell the tale by wearing the life jacket.  We listened to the terrible stories we heard from fishermen's families.  When the body is lost nothing can move in respect of the will for that family for seven years because the bank accounts cannot be accessed.  We tried to play on the responsibility of the fisherman to live and tell his tale.  We learnt a great deal by using real fishermen who had fallen into the sea, not actors but people who could tell the story that resonated with the fishermen.  We are continually building the story behind it and are working out how to repeat it.<\/p><p>We are looking at avenues such as the Skipper Expo which we will revisit in March.  We had it as our highlight at the SeaFest in July.  We are trying to appeal to the broader communities to make everybody aware that wearing a life jacket is a must and the equivalent of wearing a safety belt when driving a car.  We have quite a degree of work and communication to do on that and we are still working on the development phases of it.  <\/p><p> I am probably going back and forth on the Brexit issue.  All arrangements are being examined as we build scenarios, whether it would be an Norwegian arrangement, whether it would be negotiated every year and what the likely negotiation positions would be, but the key stark fact is that English fishermen are communicating that seafood should be seen as the calling card or benchmark of success of Brexit, such that if they win in the seafood industry, then Brexit was right.  They are building their profile as well as a very emotional argument with the public in the UK to make the case that a win that everybody can benchmark is if they completely win all access to fish in their waters for themselves.  When we are dealing with that as an opening position across the table from us, all we can do is build cases and scenarios behind that to ensure that on our side of the debate fisheries is in no way seen as not being important and that it should also have a high profile.  It is by showing graphs like this that we can build it into everybody's agenda that fisheries has to be fought for at a very hard level on our side.<\/p><p> In the context of market breakdown, the UK is our industry's number two market for exports after France.  It is an important market for us but there is quite a diversity in our market profile in fish.  Unlike in the wider food industry where the UK accounts for 42% of our total exports, while it is our industry's number two market, it is at a lower level.  We have companies that would be very dependent on that market, but the difference in seafood is that often much of those exports are sold to spot auctions rather than being tied into retail contracts that would be in place in, say, the mushroom industry or the beef industry.  That means there is much greater flexibility when there are issues with sterling or with market access.  <\/p><p> Regarding the import opportunity, it is quite specific to seafood in that what we import, for the most part, is salmon, of which we do not have an Irish quantity.  We produce Irish organic salmon but often when we look at the supermarket shelves we see our consumers are buying non-organic salmon, which is imported.  It is challenging to see a win opportunity completely for that in the shorter term.  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Michael Keatinge, to deal with the land obligation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>People are aware that the former practice of discarding fish has now been discontinued.  That was a problem we faced for many years.  Much of the catch was thrown back because it might have been undersized and there was a legal requirement to throw it back but perhaps the more difficult issue to comprehend was to be found particularly in our whitefish sector.  Fishermen do not simply fish for cod; they will catch cod, haddock and whiting or when they fish for prawns they may get cod along with prawns.  If they ran out of quota in one species, they kept fishing for another species and threw back big healthy fish that were dead.  That is a major challenge.  One of the areas that concerns us as we go into the new regime, which will come fully online in the next two years, is that we could face what are known as choke scenarios, where when, for example, we would run out of cod we would still have prawn quota.<\/p> <p>  The main area in which Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, has been involved is gear technology in terms of how to develop a net that will optimise the catch to ensure that the fishermen are not faced with the dilemma that if they continue to fish the quota they have, having perhaps over-fished or exhausted their quota in cod, they will now have to leave the fishing grounds and go ashore.  It has been encouraging that all the fishing organisations have rallied around this.  There has been a huge new emphasis on examining how to effect that change.  This approach has been taken on board and in the past two years in particular, we have looked at a range of different fisheries based particularly on their importance.  We have looked at the nephrops or prawn fishery and in particular the problems we have in cod or whiting.  We are now able to show that it is possible to minimise unwanted catch.  It is not that the fishermen do not want the fish but if they catch them they will no longer have fish quota.  We are moving towards technical solutions.  It would be wrong to suggest that there will not be challenges.  I think everybody agrees that the practice of discarding was inherently a problem area.  Removing that practice completely causes another problem.  I believe we will see a combination of the technical changes we are developing in tandem with what we will call quota uplifts where we will get additional quota to account for what we used to discard.  I can see light at the end of the tunnel but the path ahead will be difficult.  We have noticed that one element has changed during the past two years.  We were doing technical trials for a long time but people were not buying into them.  However, now the writing is on the wall and fishermen are genuinely engaging with this process.  I believe we will see a way through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>With regard to the Seafood Development Centre, SDC, one of our big challenges is ensuring engagement from the industry.  BIM has commissioned an internal review in the past three months which my colleague, Donal Buckley, is leading.  We want to redefine how innovation is looked at by the seafood industry.  Building on what Mr. Michael Keatinge said, innovation is too often simply described as adding a sauce to a product and seen as the production of a ready meal or something like that but that is not what it should be.  We are seeking to reinvent the culture of innovation in our industry where we would be associated with the much more traditional approach to our product development rather than being best in the class.  We are seeking to benchmark BIM and the industry on where the flows of innovation and the white spaces of innovation are on which we should be working much more closely with industry towards further investment in our gear technology and helping the industry to adapt that technology.  That is no point in us doing great research and nobody using it on boats.  It must be relevant to the challenges our industry is facing.  It is a challenge that we as an organisation and our industry are facing up to where we believe, as I mentioned in my presentation, the four pillars are linked.  We believe innovation is key and engagement from industry will come, but it will only come if we support it through our education and training.  What we need to do and are mapping to do in our schools in Greencastle and Castletownbere is layering an understanding of the need for innovation into our basic training, and we have young people in our schools.  In that way we are training our industry to appreciate the business challenge that lies ahead.  We are looking at the innovation element of getting industry engaging with the SDC, whether it be in Letterkenny or in Clonakilty, as a longer-term challenge rather than a six-month challenge, but we are mapping the engagement levels all the time.

Small boats comprise 80% of our fishing fleet.  I am referring to the traditional currach and the traditional half-decker, the boats we would see not so much in Killybegs but in Belmullet.  This area accounts for approximately half the total employment directly on board boats.  It brings wealth to the corners of the coastline that many people do not realise or forget about at times.  For many years we had very effective, strong fishermen's organisations but they were largely associated with the bigger ports of Killybegs, Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Rossaveal and so on and the bigger boats in particular.  We tried some years ago to create a new initiative around the inshore fisherman or woman.  This time around we have gone for a very bottom up approach and, in tandem, with the fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, which are the source of investment, we have put in place local committees to deal with national inshore fishery issues at a regional level.<\/p><p>We have had six and will increase that to seven.  Each regional forum then sends two delegates to the national forum.  I am delighted to report there has been a deep engagement with the Minister.  The Minister has met the forum on several occasions.  For the first time, we now have got a direct link from regional groups, which can be inclusive, through the national forum directly to the Minister and the Department.<\/p><p> Our role has been soft.  We facilitate it through a secretariat.  Funding is provided jointly by the State and the EU to make it happen.  We very much left the industry drive this and set the agenda.  It has been a period of learning.  Where might this go in the future?  Moving away from cod, whiting, mackerel or herring, the EU tends to allow us manage non-quota species, such as lobster, whelk, crab, razor clam, nationally.  The EU really stands back and allows us to get on with it.  The forums will provide the mechanism to create new management thinking around those stocks.  Dialogue from the ground up, along with access to the Department and to the Minister, are all important in this regard.  The future is about more direct management of local fish stocks by the local groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>With regard to the fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, we did come in very much at the tail end of it the last time.

We did a comprehensive review of what happened in that last 18 months to ensure this round of FLAGs would be a productive one.<\/p> <p>  Within the review, we found that, although it had only &euro;1.5 million of funding attached, it was amazingly efficient in getting small jobs done in local communities.  This had an impact on a small job here or creating a full-time job or a part-time job there or making families stay in a locality.  Some fantastic individual stories came out of our FLAGs programme.  The EU has insisted the ethos of FLAGs must be from the bottom up.  It cannot be the State dictating to local communities what they should or should not be doing.  This is local communities managing their local areas, coming up with a strategy and deciding what areas should be funded.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the funding available to each of those FLAGs was announced by the Minister.  The designated FLAGs have been established and are now working towards the creation of a strategy to ensure they can implement those funds.  We are hugely confident of how much they can do when one increases the budget that significantly.  The fact they have been run by local individuals means that we will co-ordinate, help and take the learnings from putting in key measurable impacts.  This will ensure we are tracking what is being done, what will and will not work, what will create longevity and be true to the strategy they are developing.

It is one of the most fantastic and challenging aspects of being an agency established since 1952.  It has probably done a bit of everything over that period.  Focus is the key skill which we have to maintain.<\/p> <p>  Over the past year, focus has been the absolute priority in our organisation.  We want to be the best at doing the four key actions we outlined today.  We want to be the best at providing a talent stream to this industry.

If someone comes into the industry, how transferable are their skills?  How do we identify the future leaders of our industry?  What skills can we provide them with and how do we train people to be businessmen and businesswomen of our industry, not just driving a boat?  That is the key change.  This industry will not die on its feet if it has the best people working in it.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, sustainability has to be part of the DNA of our industry.  There is a significant amount of work being done in that space.  The industry is very poor at articulating just how much it is doing in this regard, however.

If we think we can do the same things we did in 1952, we will die on our feet.  How does one build the culture of innovation into our industry to allow it to manage within the constraints in which it must operate?  We are not challenged with implementing all of the controls.

Part of our role is to bring that additional information on the economic impact and sustainability of communities and to build it up along with the Marine Institute, which has responsibility for the scientific argument.

To think there is complete ignorance of the social impact would be unfair.

In the case of a surplus and where it is sustainable to do so, it should be possible for an area to capitalise on a product for which it is well known.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#S00400","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I can answer that question directly because I worked with P&aacute;draic White on the drafting of the report of the drift-net buy-out.  I can categorically say that the intention at the time was that where there was a surplus or a new surplus because of the removal of the drift-net fishery, it should be fairly shared out.  I would argue that the traditional fisherman, namely, the commercial sea fisherman, has not enjoyed any benefit from the surplus.  There is a massive surplus on the River Moy, none of which is going to the commercial side.  One could, in theory, have an upstream trap managed by a local community that would harvest the surplus for commercial purposes.  A question arises regarding what was the intention as set out in the original report.  The State invested &euro;25 million.  This had a major socioeconomic impact on the western seaboard, particularly in counties Donegal, Cork, Galway and Mayo.  People were very badly affected.  There has been some indication of fish returning to rivers where stocks were very low.

The breakwater at Greencastle Harbour in Donegal is half completed and while the harbour users group has very exciting plans, it is caught in a dilemma in that when it raises the issue with the Minister, the response is that the matter is one for Donegal County Council, which owns the harbour.  As I understand it, there are six harbours under the control of the Department and the lion's share of the funding is going to these.  The report references the work going on at Greencastle in terms of landings, tonnage and so on, which means that it is obviously viewed by BIM as significant.  However, it is not getting the investment it needs to develop industry there.  This is particularly worrying for the fishing community in Donegal and other areas closer to what will become British waters only.  Has BIM offered an opinion to Government on how harbours are funded?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to aquaculture.  BIM's report, The Business of Seafood, which is excellent, testifies to the growing contribution of the aquaculture sector in terms of job creation.  The witnesses will have listened to the proceedings of the previous session.  What is their view on the huge delays in decision-making around licensing such that, local community objections aside, decisions are made in a timely manner and there is a proper framework in place for the licensing system?  I am advised by the aquaculture industry that people are bewildered at the growth in the industry in other countries and the failure to deliver on the potential of the industry here.  Taking on board all environmental concerns there is a space for aquaculture in this State and we are not helping it to achieve its potential.  I would welcome a response from BIM on its engagement with the Department over the years to address these issues.<\/p> <p>  I commend BIM on and thank it for the map provided.  One cannot beat a map when it comes to showing the seriousness of a situation.  Lest anybody doubts the impact of Brexit on our fishing community, the position is clearly indicated on that map.  Perhaps BIM would elaborate further on its input in this area.  The opening statement made on behalf of BIM commenced with the issue of Brexit, which testifies to BIM's concern in that regard but I would welcome further detail around the negotiations that may evolve, BIM's experience at a European level and so on.  BIM has already made clear that Britain has said that control over its waters will be a key issue for it in demonstrating the benefits of Brexit.

At other levels, a number of industry liaison groups relating to the wider food issue have been set up and we participate on them.  Approximately three meetings of those groups have already taken place.  We also attended the Taoiseach's forum on Brexit on Wednesday last.  My colleague, Mr. Keatinge, attended that.

Sadly, there has been one death in the fishing sector this year in Ireland.  A fisherman was lost in Galway Bay late in the summer.  The good story, perhaps, is that this is the lowest year on record.  Indeed, so far this year the Irish fishing industry is the safest in Europe.  On the safety area, we are working on a programme to roll out safety signage at all the harbours and ports around the country.  With regard to the FLAGs in particular, we are supporting co-operation projects with the county councils.  Apart from Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal and Killybegs, all the other harbours are managed by the county councils.  It is a major task but as I travel around the coast, and I do so every weekend, I see the changes taking place.  Piers are being repaired.  I visit the little pier at Kilkieran Bay all the time, where there is seaweed harvesting and inshore fishing.  A small investment like that can be the difference between that harbour ending and jobs being lost.  However, the FLAG budget of &euro;12 million is limited.  We can do, and have done, certain types of projects with county councils.  In Greencastle, for example, we installed the chair lift to enable disabled sailors to participate in sport.  However, completing a multimillion euro project such as that mentioned is beyond our scope.<\/p> <p>  The Department has a direct role in six fishery harbour centres.  Putting it bluntly, and we know the facts in this regard, there has been major investment in the new harbour in Killybegs.  It is one of the finest fishery harbours in Europe and it has meant that we continue to attract foreign vessels.  They always fished off our coasts but they now come here and land.  Deputy Pringle and I attended the opening of the new fishmeal plant there.  This is a &euro;30 million investment by Norway, in particular, without any State assistance.  It will guarantee jobs and improve environmental confidence in the plant.  It is really making the statement that Killybegs is going to stay in place.  Likewise, there has been a major development in the fishery harbour in Rossaveal that will attract additional landings.  There has been major investment in Castletownbere Dinish Island, making it a premier port in the south west.  Dunmore East has had a major dredging programme in the last number of years and major work has been done in Clogherhead.  The new pier there was completed five or six years ago.  The Greencastle project is under way.  Yes, we would like to see it finished tomorrow, but hopefully it will be finished in due course.<\/p> <p>  There has been major investment.  With regard to the very small harbours, in the last seven years it has been challenging for everybody to find funds, not least the county councils.  My personal experience is that things are getting done and I believe the FLAG programme can assist that.  Of course we would like to see more of that type of activity into the future.  We are supporting co-operation with county councils for developments in a local area, provided that is what the locals want.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Leader, we sit on the Leader evaluation committees and they work with us.  I am unashamed to tell the committee that we wish to carve out a unique identity.  We want fisheries local action groups to be in place and proud of it.  That is not to say there is any competition.  We do not see them as just another little Leader.  We want them to be quite unique in what they are achieving.  We are probably unique in the European Union and this is possibly why we are a little slow to get it up and going.  On a map of the UK there is a FLAG programme in Wales and one goes all the way around to south Devon before seeing a little FLAG which covers approximately 20 miles.  There is another FLAG somewhere south of London.  Ireland refused to do that and decided that every inch of our coastline with the exception of the cities, where it is not allowed, would have a FLAG.  We were saying that every fisherman in Ireland will be in a FLAG, so it was a bigger challenge.  I believe we have done the right thing.  There is no fishing community in Ireland that cannot participate in the FLAG programme.  It is something of which we should be justifiably proud.  The European Union has looked at our model and has recognised that it can work very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Senator Mulherin asked about the Bord Bia link and the remit of the two agencies.  Bord Bia is the agency that is responsible for the marketing of all food and drink products.  Our agency is the development agency.  The marketing of seafood was transferred from BIM to Bord Bia six or seven years ago.  However, we work very closely with Bord Bia.  Two key areas of partnership are sustainability and innovation.  In the case of sustainability, Ireland is in the unique position of having a national programme for its food under the title Origin Green.  Looking at how that works in beef or dairy, there are quality assurance schemes that run from farm to fork in which Bord Bia looks at the traceability and so forth.  BIM runs the quality assurance and traceability schemes in seafood.  There was a remit for us to reformulate all of our schemes to ensure they were allowing Origin Green to communicate strongly for seafood.  We have set up a market advisory group that specifically calls out what seafood buyers are seeking in sustainability and what our schemes need to achieve to be able to allow both our processors and Bord Bia make those claims on our behalf.  We work in partnership in that way.<\/p> <p>  There is a second strong area of partnership.  As I mentioned previously, we have an agenda of introducing a culture of innovation to the industry.  We can do that from a technical perspective but if our insights are not informed by the market and the consumer, they could possibly be a distraction to people.  We have set very clear partnerships with Bord Bia in which it helps us on the consumer and market insights and informs us on our innovation agenda, to ensure the advice we are giving to people is practical and relevant to them.  In our seafood development centre we are in ongoing discussions.  In the last number of months Bord Bia has launched a fantastic thinking house concept in Clanwilliam Court and we are asking it to have an outreach programme to our centres in Clonakilty so that its consumer insight is just a touch of a screen away.  When processors go there they will have a seamless connection between Bord Bia and BIM on anything like that.  It is a very close working relationship but both agencies have distinct and specific remits within it.<\/p> <p>  Michael Keatinge addressed the funding of harbours.  With regard to aquaculture, we are not part of the licensing system.  We are working with industry in the space of facilitating, guiding and advising it through that.  There is nobody who has encountered that system who has not been frustrated.  They would like it to work much faster, and we are part of that as well.  We are in regular dialogue with the Marine Institute on the assessments and we have huge faith in the institute having the scientific advice.  We would not presume to touch that in any way.  We let those people do their jobs.  The Minister has announced that he will undertake a review of the licensing system and we will facilitate any requests made of us.  However, we work to our remit, and we are not a regulatory party in that system.  What we do all the time is talk to both the Department and industry on the challenges, what is the right thing to do and what must be done so there are no surprises from anybody.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the Greencastle school.  We are making a significant investment in Greencastle.  Michael Keatinge is best placed to describe it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>A point I would make about giving somebody a life jacket is that training is essential.  In terms of how we approach that, a person does not just get a life jacket.  He or she must do a day's training.  However, we recognise that if we are to change people's thinking around these issues, doing a training course in a swimming pool has all the realism of the safety of one's bath at home.  What we are putting into Greencastle will be a state-of-the-art, world-class simulator.  Essentially, it is a swimming pool with waves, thunder and lightning.  The idea is to get people into that pool and show them what it will be like if this ever happens and how all of it will unfold in terms of using the equipment, coping with water splashing in their faces and being able to set off their beacons.  It is part of the complete change Ms McCarthy spoke about in terms of how we look at skills and training.<\/p> <p>  Safety must be at the heart of everything, but we have a much bigger plan in terms of the college in Greencastle, the school in Castletownbere and the two mobile units, one of which is currently in Mayo bringing training to Belmullet.  Rather than trying to bring people from Belmullet all the way to Castletownbere or Greencastle, we bring the training to them.  We are embarking on a radical rethink of creating an industry that has the best talent but that also brings out the best talent.  We are literally looking at what we are offering.  For example, if a person wants to drive a fishing boat, for many years that person was required to have a certificate from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and we do the training to prepare that person for it.  However, we are saying that the fishermen of the future have to understand microbiology and food handling because they are storing a food product.  They have to be able to understand the scientific advice.  People getting ready for the seafood industry should be out on the boats with the Marine Institute understanding stock assessment and gear technology.<\/p> <p>  If we move across that into processing and aquaculture, I hope that when we are before the committee next year, we will be telling the members that we now have a ten-year plan that will radically change things.  We have said many times that in modern Ireland, school leavers in Castletownbere, Belmullet or wherever often went into fishing because their fathers had boats.  Those young people leaving school now can be whatever they want to be, and we must compete to bring them into our sector and offer them a whole-of-life career.  That is what we are about.  I am excited about this, and the colleges in Greencastle and Castletownbere and our facility in Clonakilty for the processing side and innovation will be at the heart of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Has Ms McCarthy completed her submission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Yes, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McCarthy and her colleagues for coming before the committee today and for the interesting discussion on their industry, the future of which appears very bright.

I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to meet them.  We very much welcome and value their interest in our work.<\/p> <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is the youngest and smallest State agency before the committee today.  The 2006 Act established the SFPA with a three-person executive of authority members at its helm, including one chair.  Our primary statutory role is as the regulatory agency for Irish sea fishing and seafood production.  We are charged with promoting, verifying and, where necessary, enforcing compliance with sea fisheries and seafood safety legislation.  We act as the guardians.  Our mandate covers all fishing vessels operating within Ireland&rsquo;s 200 mile limit, more than 2,000 Irish registered fishing vessels wherever they operate, and all seafood produced in Ireland&rsquo;s 170 seafood processing companies.  Under the Common Fisheries Policy we also play a substantial coastal State role for non-Irish registered vessels operating in waters under Irish jurisdiction.  Over 80% of the wild fish taken from Irish waters are taken by vessels from other member states.  Our Act gives us additional roles in collating sea fishing data, representing the State and providing advice on policy as regards effective control.<\/p> <p>  We maintain an inspectorate, currently with 58 sea fishery protection officers operating from seven regional port offices 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Our sea fishery role includes the inspection of landings and weighing of fishery products by operators at processing establishments to verify the quantities of each species landed.  We work closely with the Irish Naval Service and the Air Corps, which carry out all inspections at sea, as well as a national fishery monitoring centre under service level agreement to us.<\/p> <p>  In seafood safety our role is to ensure compliance with all relevant legislation, thereby providing robust confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s reputation worldwide as a source of high-quality fish and fish products.  As an official agency of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, we are responsible for the control of the food safety systems around all seafood from production by fishermen or farmers throughout the production chain as far as but not including retail.<\/p> <p>  We maintain Ireland&rsquo;s shellfish classification system which classifies production areas according to water quality in line with European food regulations and has ramifications for how shellfish may be placed on the market.  We also validate labelling and traceability systems, including DNA checks on fish species.<\/p> <p>  We are also responsible for providing health certificates detailing origin and traceability for every consignment of fish and fish products manufactured, processed or packaged in Ireland for export to a growing number of third countries.<\/p><p>Furthermore, we are responsible for providing health certificate detailing origin and traceability for every consignment of fish and fish products manufactured, processed or packaged in Ireland for export to a growing number of Third countries.<\/p><p> Since our establishment, our remit has broadened and our volume of work has grown.  On the fishery protection side, for example, we have developed and maintain substantial ICT systems to facilitate compliance of Irish fishermen with their obligations to have functioning vessel monitoring systems and electronic recording systems on board, and to facilitate transmission and receipt of such data across member states.  In addition, we provide the necessary regulatory resources to support the protected designation of marine areas according to environmental legislation.<\/p><p> One of our less visible outputs is our advice on policy regarding effective control.  While we do not formulate policy, our work helps to ensure that regulations can be applied effectively.<\/p><p> We are mindful of the burden of compliance and endeavour to assist industry where we can whether its with training for use of onboard monitoring systems, or in seeking selected derogations for the EU such as the weighting derogation obtained by us in 2012 that allows weighing to take place after transport, and typically at processing establishments, provided the SFPA is satisfied with the accuracy and integrity of those weighing systems.<\/p><p> We do not have the resources to be present at every landing or every shellfish farm every day of the week.  Instead we adopt a risk-based approach, devoting our time to those areas where we assess the highest probability of non-compliance.<\/p><p> When it comes to compliance, there is no doubt committee members have heard calls for a level playing field.  We completely agree that compliance expectations on fishermen should not differ regardless of vessel flag, fishing location or landing port.  The reality is that Irish fishermen have tighter quotas than many of their EU counterparts.  We devote substantial resource in representing Ireland at various EU fora promulgating our concept of a level playing field and one of compliance.  An industry built on compliance is the outcome we are working towards in our three-year Government endorsed strategy.  Support, advise, validate and enforce are the four pillars that provide a framework for our work to 2017 and our commitment to fair, effective and independent regulation.  The low levels of non-compliance that we find across sea-fisheries and seafood production are testament to the committed efforts of the majority of fishermen, fish farmers and fish processors to try to work within the law. <\/p><p> From time to time we have detected non-compliance.  Sanctions have a specific punitive role for the wrongdoer and a much wider deterrent role for others.  The dissuasiveness of sanctioning systems is linked to their immediacy and proportionality.  Would-be non-compliers need to know that non-compliance will result in sufficiently undesirable sanctions, proportionate to the extent of wrongdoing.  However, we have a limited regulatory toolbox.  In food safety we can issue legal notices with or without the publication of details, issue fixed penalty notices or fines or initiate prosecutions.  In our sea fisheries infringements, we prepare case files for assessment by the DPP with a  view to indictment and prosecution.  The national system for assigning points for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is being reassessed following various legal challenges. <\/p><p> We will use all the tools made available to us appropriately to sanction those who continue to flout the laws that have been designed to fairly distribute a shared natural resource.  The low number of instances when points were proposed or when case files were initiated show our view of how infrequently such actions for serious infringements are appropriate and when used have good effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Steele.

Has the authority made any proposals to the Department in respect of the Bill?  There is another Bill entitled the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction (Fixed Penalty Notice) Bill.  The authority works the system of compliance.  What improvements would it recommend for inclusion in legislation?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Steele mentioned prosecutions.  How many prosecutions have reached the courts since the authority's establishment in 2006?  How many prosecutions were challenged?  How many court cases were lost by the SFPA?  Was a cost incurred in losing the court cases?  <\/p> <p>  People who work in the industry have told me that anyone who challenges the system and challenges prosecutions being brought against them seem to be targeted for more common inspections after the fact.  How does the authority ensure such a situation does not happen?  <\/p> <p>  There is another issue that is raised with us.  In Ireland we tend to take directives literally and are over-compliant when it comes to implementing them.  How do we compare with Spain, France and Portugal, in particular?  Fishermen have given me anecdotal evidence that these three countries employ a much looser compliance system and they do not seem to be as strict as we are in Ireland.  The authority holds discussions with other agencies and I want it to ensure there is a level playing field.  Can compliance be relaxed as part of the new Bill?  We all want to ensure the industry is well regulated, maintained and that environmental issues are taken on board.  On the other hand, we want fishermen to conduct their work without being too fettered to directives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#V00400","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Steele for her presentation.  I will continue the same theme raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Any pelagic vessel that lands with over 5 tonnes can be inspected at any port in Ireland.  The inspection system for factory vessels differs in that they report what they have caught and landed from whatever port they arrive in and the information is sent to the authority.  I understand that to be the case but it may not be the situation.  How many times are factory vessels inspected at sea when in Irish waters?  How likely are inspections to take place?  At the start of this year inspections of these vessels that operated off the Donegal coast was topical.  The Department was categorical in stating that it would not conduct inspections and it would be left to the Naval Service to decide whether it was safe to inspect factory ships at sea.  Should we have a system of asking the vessels to come into safe waters for inspection?   Is it a feasible request?<\/p><p>The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, 2014 document that has been distributed to members indicates there were 1,457 fishing vessel inspections.  Is there a breakdown of how many of those vessels were Irish and how many were Spanish or other nationalities?  Will the witnesses explain how the information is exchanged with other EU member states on the quota situation of, for example, Spanish vessels or French vessels fishing in Irish waters?  Does the SFPA get accurate information on their quotas and how the individual vessels are affected with regard to quotas?  Does that information become a factor in whether the vessels will actually be inspected when they land at ports?  Any members who have fishing ports in their areas constantly hear the complaint about three or four Spanish vessels, for example, landing into Killybegs Port where the catch is loaded straight onto the back of a lorry and is taken away with no fishery officers present.  When an Irish boat from Killybegs or Donegal comes into port, four fishery officers arrive at the boat to inspect it.  I know this may be due to a requirement that pelagic vessels be inspected when they are landing over five tonnes but it is something fishermen find very hard to understand and to live with.  Reference was made to penalty points being suspended at the moment.  Is it the case that no penalty points are being issued?  Perhaps the representatives from SFPA can confirm this will be the case, subject to the conclusion of the court cases and before the new regulation comes into effect.  There was an issue regarding the Chinese market and mercury levels in crab meat and I do not know if it has been resolved yet.  Will the witnesses please update the committee in this regard?  My last question relates to oyster dredging in Lough Swilly.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has the role of issuing fishing licences to those vessels and the SFPA has an enforcement role and carries out the inspections.  Is this is the case?  There is a provision that the vessel licenceholder has to be on board the vessel at all times it is fishing.  Is that something the SFPA factors in for its inspections?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#V00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The representatives from the SFPA should elaborate a bit more on its environmental remit and in particular its protection of designated marine areas in accordance with environmental legislation, as Dr. Steele has described.

With regard to Deputy Pringle's point, if there is a diminution of water quality, for example, if a designated shellfish area experiences a diminution of water quality, does the SFPA go after whoever causes the pollution that affects the shellfish?  One of the jobs of work for Irish Water is to address the problem in some coastal towns where there is no proper sewage treatment or sewage systems and where raw effluent makes its way into bays.

The first question was about the scrutiny.  We hear this all the time as well.  The first thing one will hear at a port is \"How come more Irish vessels are being inspected than foreign vessels?\"  When we look at the statistics - which are in the annual report - and we take out smaller vessels, a vessel landing has a one in ten chance of being inspected if it is a foreign vessel and a one in 15 chance if it is an Irish vessel, when working on the inspections by numbers.  We work, however, on a risk basis; if a vessel has had a higher risk behaviour or has shown something that looks like there would be more cause for an inspection, that is how the inspections are done.  We do not have a target number per year of so many foreign vessels or so many Irish vessels to be inspected.  We work on a risk basis.  I will provide committee members with the statistics and the breakdown of how every single inspection is carried out but we are looking at ensuring marine resources are shared fairly.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to factory ships and how these might be policed.  We see risks in factory ships and we see huge numbers of risks in Community vessels fishing in Irish waters.  A Community vessel hails when it is coming in to Irish waters and then we will receive the information on what their catch is when they are fishing in Irish waters.  Then, when they exit our waters we no longer receive those reports.  Reports can be changed after they leave Irish waters.  We see this as a huge risk.  We have travelled to meet with the EU Director General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Machado and the Commission to raise our fears about the risks that are there.  The SFPA sits on a number of different compliance committees and with other Community regulatory authorities where we would discuss this issue to try to find solutions to these risks.  How do we police factory ships?  We police them by inspections.  The Naval Service will inspect them with at-sea inspections.  They are extremely difficult vessels to inspect due to their size and in rough weather conditions, it would not be safe for naval officers to go on board.  An inspection would also involve fishery officers going on board to check things.  We have had some successful cases.  We use the term \"factory ships\" but large-scale processing vessels would be a good way of describing them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>If one in ten inspections are on foreign ships and one in 15 are on Irish vessels, how many of these would be boarded?

We do try to ensure that the Naval Service does get to them when they are in Irish waters at least once per season, but it would be in the order of ten to 15 inspections per year.  I can get exact numbers of inspections for the committee but in round terms, there are two broad fishing seasons in which they are present in Irish waters, namely, at the very beginning of year and at the very back end of the year, which effectively is one continuous fishing season that straddles the calendar year.  We try to get to those types of vessels at least once in those fishing seasons.  At the initial implementation, the landing obligation was in pelagic fisheries.  We risk-assessed particular compliance risks on those vessels at that time and we had a specific targeted patrol where we got to 14 of those vessels in a six-week period.  This occurred in early 2015 and the weather was a lot better than in the instances we have spoken about.  We did a round of them all.  There is a finite number of these vessels and we got to them all at that stage.  It is, however, done on a risk basis, according to resources, and according to the weather conditions.  The decision on whether or not it is safe to put a RIB in the water and to board those vessels 200 miles off Killybegs is an operational decision made by a naval captain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016110800002#W00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses have any sense of what we are told about overfishing?<\/p><p>We are told that they hoover up fish, grade them and then dump the ones they do not need.

As we said, a substantial proportion of Ireland's work is in the area of fisheries control.  The vessels in question are not registered with us, which means that they do not land fish here.  There is a ping on the vessel monitoring system when they arrive in Irish waters and there is a ping every two hours.  Generally, we check with the flag state whether they are authorised to fish and for what and receive an answer from its national fisheries monitoring centre.  We then risk assess and generally try to target our available resources at least once per season, if we can, weather permitting.  We look at their electronic recording system, ERS.  At midnight we are told what they caught on that day while in Irish waters.  We do not know what they had on board when they entered Irish waters, but we will know what has been declared on that day.  We compare this, for example, to amounts declared for analogous fishing vessels alongside them.  For example, if a large pelagic freezer trawler is fishing and has authorisation to catch horse mackerel alone and there is another vessel alongside with mixed catches of mackerel and horse mackerel and it is only logging catches of horse mackerel, there is a risk.  The Senator used the words \"hoovering\" and \"dumping\", but I say there is a risk that species will be discarded.  We identify the risk in that instance and target it, possibly by way of an Air Corps aircraft overfly, weather permitting, or a naval inspection.  Those are the steps we can take and we do take them, where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  There are other steps we take after a vessel has left Irish waters.  We have a very close working relationship with our Dutch counterparts.  In general terms, the vessels about which we are talking are owned by Dutch multinational companies and fly the flag of various countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and various other member states.

A question was not raised about this area, but there is one issue about which we are very concerned and on which we have travelled to the Commission.  When the points system was running, we applied points to foreign vessels, but the member states involved did not apply them to the licences of the foreign vessels.

One of the points we have consistently made around this table, that we make in our input to European processes and in our submissions on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is that we are not told about this.  We work in the areas of seafood safety and sea fisheries control.  In the area of food safety, the audits of member states are published.  If a member of the committee asks me if Spain is compliant, I can quote what is stated in the audit report of the Spanish food safety authority, but there is no such publication when it comes to sea fisheries control.  We believe there should be such a publication as such transparency and ventilation would greatly help to counter the view expressed by members' constituents that there is not a level playing field when it comes to compliance.  I would challenge the view that a perceived lower level of compliance is an argument in favour of less compliance.  I would spin it around and say we all need to aim for compliance.  Our version of a level playing field is one that includes compliance.  We know when a member state has been subjected to punitive sanctions owning to non-compliance.  For instance, Spain lost almost all of its mackerel quota for two years running in 2010 and 2011.<\/p><p>Member states have been sanctioned.

The role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in signing health certificates for third country non-EU markets has grown.  With the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we have to sign a health certificate for anything that is going to Russia or China.  In this case, the certificate comes from China, the Chinese authorities write it and we sign our name to a number of attestations in it, one of which relates to the cadmium levels in crabmeat.  The wording of the Chinese health certificate means that the levels of cadmium in brown and white crabmeat must be tested.  When we test brown crabmeat, it is above the Chinese minimum level.  The Chinese authorities have imposed a cadmium limit because they have had pollution problems in the past.  Unfortunately, some people thought there was pollution in Irish waters.  This would have been an issue in the United Kingdom also.  We are working proactively with the industry on this issue.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority genuinely believes we can have coastal communities full of jobs and seas full of fish.  There is huge potential in the sea.  We have travelled with the Minister to China to resolve this issue.<\/p><p>The Minister has spoken there at length about the issue.  We have brought a group of Chinese import agents here to show them that the waters are clean and pure.  We are hoping to come to a conclusion that they will look at the water testing and monitoring methods in Ireland rather than measuring the natural background level of crab.  In the meantime, we have taken a proactive step in that if we sign the health certificates knowing the level is too high, we would be risking every single bit of Ireland's reputation.  This is because what they are looking for when they get a Government agency to sign a health certificate is for us to say it is okay.  We met the industry and, rather than have the Chinese close the market, we decided that we would proactively stop it.  We are actively working to reopen that market and are confident that it will be, and that there will be a solution for the Irish industry.  As those in the industry will be aware, we are positively and proactively working to get it resolved.<\/p><p> The next question is on oyster dredging and the Swilly inspection.

We send the same list to the EPA and let it know what is happening.  We have a fairly good dialogue there.<\/p> <p>  As for whether we go after the polluters, that is not our role.

The committee decided to review the current funding model for public service broadcasting to review the effect of advertising opt-out on Irish broadcasters and to consider other related broadcasting matters.  The committee may also look at media ownership in Ireland.  We are aware of the difficulties in the current television licensing system, of the very rapid changes in technology and of the reduction in funding through commercial revenues available to all Irish broadcasters.  Although this is the first meeting in which the committee will consider public service broadcasting, we have engaged with the Minister on the funding of public service broadcasting.  We received a letter from the Minister dated 31 October 2016 on this very issue.<\/p> <p>  Today, we are meeting officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We plan to meet RTE and other stakeholders at later meetings.  I welcome the following officials from the Department: Ms Patricia Cronin, assistant secretary, Mr. &Eacute;anna &Oacute; Conghaile, principal officer, and Mr. Dualta O'Broin, assistant principal.

I hope today&rsquo;s exchange will be of benefit to the committee members in their consideration of this important issue.  I will make a brief opening statement and, following the contribution from the BAI, my colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions from the members.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s appearance before the committee today is as a result of the appearance of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, before the committee on 21 September to discuss the Department&rsquo;s Estimates.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he would not be pursuing the introduction of a household broadcasting charge in the short term was discussed.  The Minister noted the interest of the committee members in the future funding of public service media and how we define that media and indicated that he would welcome if the committee were to come forward with proposals on the issue.  He also stated that the Department would facilitate the committee in any way in its consideration of these proposals.<\/p> <p>  Since then, the Minister has developed this view to take account of the need to have a wider conversation on the future of public service broadcasting.  For example, what is it we want public service broadcasting to deliver?  What do we want public service broadcasting to look like five years or ten years from now?  The Minister is very clear that he has a statutory obligation in relation to RTE and TG4.  However, while addressing the issues facing these broadcasters, he is clear that we must consider the needs of the sector as a whole.  If the sector is to thrive, we need to take account of all aspects of broadcasting, including commercial broadcasting, community broadcasting and the rapidly developing and expanding digital sector.  If consensus can be reached on what public service broadcasting should look like in the future, then it will be possible to start a discussion in earnest on how it is intended to fund it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, wrote to the Chairman of the committee on 31 October, setting out his views at a high level.  In that letter the Minister said he fully recognises the important role that public service media plays in a democratic society and the need to ensure it is adequately resourced if it is to continue to deliver on its remit.  The Minister fully recognises his obligations to our public service broadcasters but has asked the committee to consider the longer-term issues surrounding the future funding of public service broadcasting in detail.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly give a sense of the challenges facing the broadcasting sector.  Internationally, the broadcasting sector has been subject to enormous change due to the growth of digital and online technologies, resulting in the development of new modes of delivery and new business models.  As a result, traditional broadcasters, both public and commercial, are subject to increasing competition from large international players and new forms of content delivery and need to adapt rapidly to maintain their relevance, audience and commercial revenues.<\/p> <p>  The Irish broadcasting market faces the same challenges, as an ever-increasing number of non-Irish channels compete for audience share and advertising revenues.  The increasing importance of online platforms and the use of handheld devices is further impacting on Irish broadcasters&rsquo; audiences, revenues and, in the case of public service broadcasters, licence fee revenues.<\/p><p>The Minister&rsquo;s view is that Irish audiences need strong and independent public service media outlets that can hold their own in the face of increasing competition from international media and can continue to provide the Irish public with distinctive and high-quality indigenous programming that reflects our common experience and provides a much-needed Irish perspective on events and current affairs.<\/p><p> Discussions on longer-term issues like the future funding of public sector broadcasting and how such broadcasting is defined must not lose sight of one of the Minister's core beliefs, which is that the current public service broadcasters - RTE and TG4 - require a stable financial basis on which to operate as they face funding challenges.  As I have said, the Minister has a statutory obligation in this respect and he fully intends to support the broadcasters in any way he can.  The &euro;6 million achieved for public service broadcasting in budget 2017 was described by the Minister as the beginning of the process of reversing the cuts imposed over recent years.  As the committee is aware, the Minister is not simply looking at reversing these cuts; he is also considering the potential legislative changes he could make to provide some form of respite to both organisations by helping to improve the current TV licence model so that the high level of evasion is reduced.  According to the most recent figures, the current rate of evasion is 13.75%, which is unacceptable.  The committee will also be aware of the Minister's significant decision to agree in principle to tender for the role of TV licence collection agent.  This issue, like others, is being examined in detail by the Department because legislative changes will be required.  The Minister has made it clear that current payment method options, including the post office network, have to be maintained.  These changes will feed into a longer-term strategy, which the committee&rsquo;s work will inform.  In the short term, the Minister hopes to return to the committee in the coming months with proposals for legislative changes as part of the required process of legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p> I hope my remarks have gone some way towards describing the Minister&rsquo;s views and the steps being taken by the Department.  In light of the complexity of this subject and the range of views and priorities in this area, the Minister and the Department especially welcome the committee's decision to commence public consultation on this topic.  It is only by engaging with all sides of the debate that the central and core issues and values can be identified.  I would like to pass on the Minister&rsquo;s gratitude to the Chairman and members of the committee, as well as the Clerk and his staff, for making such rapid and comprehensive progress with this subject.  We look forward to engaging with the committee this evening and answering any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Michael O'Keeffe, who is the chief executive of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members for inviting us to address the joint committee this evening.  We are looking forward to making this presentation.  We are prepared to make formal appearances at the joint committee and to give briefings on any topics relating to broadcasting that the Chairman or the members might want us to address in the future.  We have done that in the past and we would like to continue to do so.  Our offer is open.<\/p> <p>  This presentation has a number of elements.  I will give a brief outline of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's objectives and activities to date.  I will look at some of the outcomes of the five-year review that took place in 2013 and the main elements of the next review.  I will touch on some of the issues pertaining to the commercial and community sectors and how we will deal with such issues in our next strategy, on which we launched a consultation last week.  The authority's statutory objectives and functions are set out in the 2009 Act.  One of our objectives is to facilitate RTE and TG4 in fulfilling their functions.  We have a range of functions that are associated with those objectives.  They are primarily concerned with how TG4 and RTE use public funding, but they are also concerned with the impact of their commercial and economic activities, particularly as they apply to or impact on the competing commercial sector.  Our activities are designed to show that the public service broadcasters are using public funding efficiently, effectively, in a transparent manner and in pursuit of their public service objects, as set out in the Broadcasting Acts.  That would be important in terms of the role we have with them.<\/p> <p>  Our broad regulatory activities in relation to RTE and TG4 can be divided into two.  Members of the committee will be familiar with our content-monitoring activities, which include assessing levels of compliance with various codes and rules and considering complaints about broadcasting matters.  These codes and rules, including programming codes, advertising codes, access rules and subtitling rules, apply to all broadcasters and not just to RTE and TG4.  Our more specific remit with regard to financing involves a number of processes.  We look at the broadcasters' statements of commitments on an annual basis, we undertake annual reviews and we do five-year reviews of both RTE and TG4.  I will give an example of the sectoral impact assessments we undertake when new services are proposed by broadcasters.  We undertook such an assessment and made recommendations to the Minister before the RTE News Now service came on stream in recent years.  Regarding economic activities, we look at how RTE is using its commercial revenue and its licence fee income.  In the last year, we were involved in the development of RTE's fair trading policy, which looks at how its commercial activities operate fairly within the commercial environment.<\/p> <p>  As I have mentioned some of the regulatory issues, I will move on to the five-year review, which will look specifically at public funding.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the authority to carry out every five years a review of the adequacy of public funding to enable public service broadcasters to meet their public service objects.  The presentation we have furnished to the joint committee contains a list of the things we do in that context.  We look at the delivery of public service broadcasting, ensure public service broadcasters are relevant to Irish audiences, examine the role of such broadcasters in the creative economy and assess the adequacy\u00a0of current funding and the question of sustainability.  As members are probably aware, the first review was completed in July 2013.  We will commence the second review in 2017 and this will be completed in 2018.  When it has been completed, we will make a report and issue recommendations to the Minister on the outcome.<\/p> <p>  Some of the five key recommendations in the first review were covered in the comprehensive scoping document that was prepared for the committee.  I suppose the one that stood out was the increase in public funding that was proposed for both RTE and TG4, primarily to increase content.  We placed a great deal of emphasis on the question of delivering culturally relevant content for Irish audiences.  We recommended that there should be an examination of the cost-effectiveness of RTE and we looked at whether there could be greater deployment of funding to support the independent production sector.  We made a number of recommendations regarding the rebalancing of RTE's licence fee and commercial funding.  We considered whether there would be greater scope for the commercial sector to benefit if RTE had less reliance on commercial income.  We suggested that further analysis was required before making a decision on the proportion of programming that should be made in-house or through independent production.  There are differing views on that point within RTE and the various sectors on the outside.  Some of the recommendations in the review were implemented and others are still ongoing.  Obviously, the funding issue has continued to arise in the annual reviews we have done since then.  With the exception of the provisions in the current budget to which Ms Cronin referred, the funding situation has not really changed for RTE and TG4.<\/p> <p>  We are beginning the process for the next review, which will start in 2017 and will report in early 2018 or the middle of that year.  There is a slight change in emphasis in the theme of that review.  The earlier review focused on transparency and efficiency, but we are now moving on to the greater challenges encountered by the public service broadcasters as they serve Irish audiences in the evolving digital environment.  We will look at future trends and developments.  We will examine the capability of the public service broadcasters to meet the challenges.  We will review the five-year strategic plans that we will ask the broadcasters to produce in support of our work.  We have identified a number of key areas on which we will focus, including the need to serve Irish audiences, creativity, the Irish language, funding implications and any legislative or regulatory changes that are required in support of all of this.  The process we will be undertaking will have a number of elements.  We will have ongoing consultation with stakeholders throughout the process.  We will engage in a range of pieces of research to analyse things like economic trends, international public service media organisations, the general media environment, audience behaviours and technological developments.  We will also look at their performance over the past five years.  We are hopeful that we will be able to issue a comprehensive report and make recommendations at the end of that period.  We hope the Government will be in a position to support our proposals at that time.<\/p><p> It is important to mention the commercial and community broadcasting service.  I should make the point that commercial community broadcasters are not public service broadcasters and the Act does not define them as such.  However, we recognise that the Act gives them a public purpose and requires that they fill many statutory duties, and they have many public service obligations within the programming that they are required to fulfil on an ongoing basis.  That is the distinction we make and we see there is certainly merit in many of the arguments made by them around the requirements they have.  There are significant challenges for the sector currently, including the general economic climate as the impact of the recession has been hard.  There is also the impact of online media, which is true across the board of traditional broadcasting, as it has changed the way things are.  We can see that in the advertising market with changes in audience behaviours.  It is also unlikely that the market will ever come back to the level it was at in an earlier stage.<\/p><p> We launched the consultation for our strategy last year and we have put the sustainability of all broadcasters as a central objective, putting it right to the forefront of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's concerns within that.  At our launch last week this was broadly welcomed by the commercial and community sectors.  We will examine a range of different funding models and make recommendations where we can to support those, both in legislative and other ways.  I should mention a range of other initiatives that I have not put in the presentation that we undertake which support the sectors.  There is the sound and vision funding scheme, a sectoral learning and development programme that puts up to &euro;500,000 back into the sector every year and we undertake significant research.  We are looking at some of the rules for linear broadcasters; for example, we may relax some of the restrictions in place in the advertising code so as to open additional sources of funding.<\/p><p> That is the work programme we have in these areas over the next number of years.  It was a very quick run through it but I would be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Before going to members I have two questions.  The Department referenced a tendering process for the collection of the television licence.  As we know, An Post is currently the Minister's collection agent and it is paid commission to collect the fee.  In light of Mr. Bobby Kerr's report and considering the different ways we can support the An Post network by increasing the amount of State services it can deal with, is the matter outlined in the presentation seen as a retrograde step?  It may take away services from An Post in that although it will be paid per licence fee paid into the post office, there is the potential after the tendering process that somebody else could be paid for the collection service of the television licence.<\/p> <p>  Much research on the commercial pressures on media coverage - both print and broadcasting elements - indicates there is influence and pressure on the operators from commercial influences.  A substantial amount of research demonstrates that commercial media does not provide voters with sufficient information on policy and political content.  I note Dr. Kevin Rafter of Dublin City University researched the issue comprehensively and argues that Ireland would not be reflective of what happens internationally with regard to commercial and public service news organisations as there is not much of a difference in the public service element.  Whether bodies are commercial or public, they provide similar levels of public service broadcasting.

Getting David McRedmond as chief executive of An Post to increase TV licences is a fantastic example of poacher turned gamekeeper.  That will not be easy.  It has to be legislated for.  It is hard to square the circle of keeping it the old way but the old way ain't working.  I presume there is another short-term measure we must consider, for example, cable networks having a must-carry obligation for stations such as RTE.  Flipping that, at some point they must pay because there is an inequity in areas where there could be an immediate return through a fairly easy legislative change.  Similarly, the provision for the sale of land in RTE, which I have been arguing for because the land there is under-used and it is valuable land which is badly needed for housing.  They are all short-term solutions, not structural changes.  I was very glad to hear Mr. O'Keeffe's suggestion that the next round of reviewing the public service funding is considering the wider scope of how public service is evolving in the digital environment and if I am reading it aright, this would include the commercial broadcasters in some way.<\/p> <p>  Do we have figures for how much advertising companies in the digital market, such as facebook and Google, would get in the Irish market?  Are there figures for what the international and domestic satellite providers gain here?  This would give us an understanding of who the different players are.  Digital advertising is a growing area.  RTE's figures for it are approximately &euro;16 million, 10% of its commercial revenue.  What percentage is that of the overall digital advertising market?  Are there ways of finding out what that market is?  <\/p> <p>  If I recall rightly there was a consultative event in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham before the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland - Mr. O'Keeffe is long enough in the tooth to remember it.  The event was innovative, bottom-up not just top table but a genuine communication between a variety of interests.  Would it make sense for us to host, or to do so in conjunction with the BAI and the Department, a similar public event to open up this question?  There are so many people with an interest in it, the public service broadcasters, the commercial TV companies, the newspaper industry, community radio and the content providers, the independent production sector, the advertising sector, satellite and cable providers.  The committee could bring in one after the other but a public event like that event in the early 2000s, at a point when we had to seriously reconsider our public service broadcasting, would be better.  We could host it in early spring and allow different people come and in a creative, facilitated way share different ideas and output.  It is such a complex issue with so many players involved an innovative forum might be better than a series of presentations here.  I would be interested to hear the Department and BAI's assessment of that.  I have seen it work for broadband policy in the Department.  If we facilitate it cleverly it is the best way of getting different views on a complex situation.  That might assist the BAI's funding review and allow us to carry out the review the Minister commissioned us to do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#F00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>We do not have figures for Google but we do have a figure for revenue from online advertising which has increased from &euro;100 million in 2009 to &euro;340 million at the end of 2015.

Finance is the central question.  The option of a household broadcasting charge was considered but we have moved away from it.  The figure quoted for online advertising is staggering.  How much is the overall advertising revenue in the broadcasting sector?  Are there any statistics on its decline or increase in recent years?  Can the Department and BAI indicate the shortfall in revenue from advertising, coupled with the fact that the licence fee has not increased and that there is approximately 13% evasion?

While not all sections of the media are guilty of this, analysis was carried out after the recent general election and published online about three months after the election which showed that the party I represent, Sinn F&eacute;in, did not get fair media coverage and was consistently exposed to a high level of negative coverage.  The broadcasting sector was not the worst offender.  One particular print media outlet was guilty of most of the negative coverage.  Let us forget which party I represent; let us just consider the matter from the point of view of fairness.  Mr. O'Keeffe outlined in his opening remarks the importance in a functioning democracy of having good public service broadcasting, and I think we all agree with that, but has any analysis been done of that coverage?  Have conclusions been drawn from it?  Are there safeguards in place?  I would like to hear Mr. O'Keeffe's views in that regard because it is important.  While every party might complain and shout that it does not get a fair crack of the whip, even in how interviews are carried out and so on, I think any fair analysis of the last election would show - and even opponents of Sinn F&eacute;in have commented - that the coverage we received and the way in which we were presented in many of the different media outlets were a long way from fair.  Sections of the print media, particularly Independent News and Media, INM, were the worst offenders.  I acknowledge that much of the broadcast media was very fair.  The interviews on RTE and so on were fair, but many other elements were not.

Were there evidence of non-compliance, we would take action.  We have commissioned some research on the last general election from a man mentioned earlier, Kevin Rafter, who is doing that piece of work for us at the moment and we should have a report on that.  It will look at the broadcast media because, obviously, the BAI is particularly concerned about the broadcast media.  We probably will have some information on that early in the new year.

I am interested in the BAI's thoughts on the position if these were to come under its wing in the future.  I am not sure whether they are at the moment.  What responsibilities and obligations might be imposed on them and what kind of supports might they be expected to receive?<\/p> <p>  My next question concerns a figure in the BAI's opening statement about compliance and evasion.  It is stated that the level of evasion from the TV licence is 13.75%.  That does not seem that bad a level of evasion.  The corollary of that is that we have a compliance percentage in the high 80s.  I am interested to know whether that is vertical or horizontal.  My understanding is that if there are multiple devices in a house, each theoretically must be registered under the new licence fee.  A person may have multiple addresses.  We had a conversation recently about mobile homes and holiday homes.  If someone has a TV in a mobile home in Wexford for a few weeks of the year, he or she is expected to have a licence for it separate to the licence for the device in his or her homestead.  It is also my understanding that if there is a second TV in a bedroom upstairs, a separate licence must pertain to that.  Regarding the evasion fee, is it the case that every household must have a minimum of one licence, so is it a horizontal stretch and 13.75% of households do not have any licence, or is it the case that 13.75% of all the licences that should be paid have not been chased up?  I am not sure that is clear.  I will clarify that if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a general point.  Deputy Stanley raised political broadcasting.  No one party has a monopoly on complaints.  The party I represent is not always best pleased by coverage either.  The coverage is a mapping back to a function of representation in the Oireachtas, and it was not always a fair representation in terms of the coverage received.<\/p><p>I am not sure whether it has improved in the new D&aacute;il.  It is probably too early to tell, although the broadcasting sector and RTE in particular are struggling with the minority Government arrangement.  A recent \"Prime Time\" debate fundamentally misunderstood the nature of our minority Government and, therefore, perhaps it is time RTE got up to speed with the reality around most of Europe and most western democracies.

We have not put the information in the public domain yet, although when the report on public funding for 2015 is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, members will see references to the research that was used to assess the performance of both RTE and TG4.

It would require additional funding to grow its listenership and to develop and respond to the challenges it faces in the digital environment.  We are probably also reaching a similar point more recently with RTE.  Hence the strategic focus of the five-year review on examining the funding requirements.  There is funding available which will allow broadcasters to hold their current position, perhaps with some difficulty, but there is a need for them to be able to respond and evolve in the digital environment with online content and content that is made available across a range of platforms.  Both current funding and capital investment are required to facilitate those types of development.  Critically, the forthcoming five-year review of public funding will aim to focus on those key questions and examine exactly what is needed to help the broadcasters remain strong in terms of providing culturally relevant content for Irish audiences into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Therefore, it is five and five.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#J00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We do not like numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22016110800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting.

Thank you for inviting me to this meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is an honour and a pleasure to be here.<\/p> <p>  As committee members are aware, we are facing a new challenge in Europe.  One of our main allies has decided to leave the EU.  I need not convince committee members of the profound effect of Brexit on our countries.  We will lose an important partner in the European Union, a neighbour with which we share many ties, including economic, cultural and political ties.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is a strong, open and competitive economy, like the Netherlands.  The UK is Ireland's first and the Netherlands third largest trading partner.  Ireland and the Netherlands are two countries very much affected economically if the UK leaves the Internal Market.  The consequences do not stop there, however.  Our countries have sizeable communities working in the UK whose fate is now uncertain.  Our countries will lose an ally on trade-oriented liberal policy making in the EU.  Further consequences loom for this beautiful island if Brexit sees a return to the borders of the past.  Of course, the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland is a sensitive issue. We fully understand this and we believe this should be taken into account when negotiations begin.<\/p> <p>  No matter how things play out, a deal for a new relationship between the European Union and the UK will be challenging.  For our economies, which have such links to the British economy, a long period of uncertainty is undesirable.  Uncertainty will delay investments and slow down economic growth.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we should allow the UK and the EU to prepare carefully for the negotiations.  We need an orderly process and we should not rush it.  It needs to be an inclusive process and member states need to be involved in the negotiations.  A final agreement should reflect the interests of the member states, including the economic interests of the Netherlands and those of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Until the UK has invoked Article 50, the position of the EU 27 member states, including the Netherlands, has been clear: there can be no negotiation without notification.  The new relationship does not have unlimited scope for negotiation.  For example, the view of the EU 27 member states is that access to the Internal Market is connected to the four freedoms.  The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Rutte, made this clear to the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, during her recent visit to the Netherlands.  The Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Bert Koenders, has also been clear on this point to the UK.  Moreover, he has reiterated this position in talks with the EU 27 countries and during his recent visit to Dublin two months ago.<\/p> <p>  While we are in this process, the 27 member states will stay on the same page, as underlined at the European Council last June.  Sixty years of European co-operation have built strong bonds of partnership between member states and the European institutions.  We must build on our strength and develop new ties with the United Kingdom.  We will do this together.  We will all benefit from a clear, united and swift approach in preparing for negotiations, which will start once the UK has formally notified its intention to withdraw from the Union.<\/p> <p>  The process for the Brexit negotiations remains unclear.  The upcoming Council meetings will bring more clarity to the internal EU 27 group preparations and the preferred negotiating process.  Much will depend on the UK in this respect and the eventual notification.  Like Ireland, the Netherlands is of course preparing internally for the upcoming negotiations.  Our ministers are in close contact with members' counterparts in the Dutch Parliament.  I am pleased to say we have a close working relationship with Ireland on the Brexit negotiation preparations.  During the coming period, committee members will probably also be in close contact with the other parliaments from the 27 EU member states, as well as the European Parliament, just as their Dutch counterparts are.  Furthermore, the Netherlands is looking forward to strengthening and broadening our bilateral relationship in the future.  Ireland and the Netherlands are natural partners in the EU 27 group, not only politically but economically.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to comment on Brexit and its effects.  It is the dawn of a new era.  It is the case that the British referendum results will have a major impact on the European Union and on individual member states like Ireland and the Netherlands.  However, the current turmoil also allows us to really think about the value of the Union and to re-energise our efforts to continue improving it for our citizens.  It gives us a reminder of the need to combine our powers and work on improving the European Union together.  Ireland and the Netherlands are like-minded countries here.  We are natural partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Thank you for the invitation.  It is a pleasure and an honour to be here.  It is useful to have an exchange about this pressing and important issue.<\/p> <p>  I wish to echo what has been said by the Chairman with regard to how this presentation will not set out the position of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, a position Slovakia holds at the moment.  This is because it has been agreed that there will be no negotiation without notification.  Since we expect Article 50 to be triggered only by the end of March 2017, there is effectively no role for the Presidency at this time.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is a little like a black hole in the field of astronomy.  We know that it exists and we have extensive theoretical wisdom about it but no one really knows how it works or what it does.  Indeed, one of the major problems of Brexit and its consequences at this point is the existence of such uncertainty and numerous variables.  Another fact is that the impact of Brexit will be different in respective member states.  Slovakia, Ireland and Netherlands have diverse degrees of attachment to the UK.  There is rather modest economic co-operation between Slovakia and the UK for many objective reasons.  These objective reasons are pretty much valid in respect of Ireland as well.<\/p><p>The overall trade exchange is less than &euro;5 billion per year.  That is what you produce in one month.  Many Slovak exporters will feel and have already felt the weakness of the British pound similar to Irish exporters but it differs from commodity to commodity and some commodities are less prone to be affected than others.<\/p><p> The UK was never one of the largest investors in Slovakia.  Its tenth place ranking is due rather to the sheer size of the UK economy rather than some extraordinary or strategic investor activity.  That has changed somewhat recently.  Range Rover invested &euro;1.5 billion in Slovakia.  To show the diversity and variety of possibilities of how Brexit will affect Slovakia, Brexit could be a catalyst for increasing the investment of Range Rover, especially if the process goes towards a hard Brexit.  However, that is only as a hypothesis and speculation.  An important point mentioned by my colleague is the relatively sizeable number of Slovak citizens living in the UK.<\/p><p> The biggest question for Slovakia is the overall impact of Brexit on the EU as a whole.  The Brexit vote is definitely an unprecedented moment in the history of the European Union but also in the history of the post-war multilateral system.  We know that we are going to lose the third largest member state, which has the fifth largest national economy in the world and is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.  I could continue listing the characteristics of the UK.  This is a reality we have to face but have to make the best of it.<\/p><p> The decision had much to do with internal politics in Britain but the vote should also be viewed as a wake-up call for the entire Union.  We should ask ourselves frankly why our citizens are withdrawing their trust from the EU.  After the referendum, the Heads of State of the EU 27 agreed to start a political reflection process and met informally in Bratislava in September.  The Bratislava summit was a unique opportunity for the leaders to have an open political debate without immediate pressure to present some instant solutions.  Such debate was badly needed because a European Council meeting in itself usually do not give enough space for a more strategic and in-depth discussion.  The ambition in Bratislava was twofold, namely, to provide the general diagnosis for the current situation and to agree on concrete areas of action which will have priority in the coming  months.  There were huge expectations.  At the end of the summit, some people were disappointed and said that the outcome was too basic and too simplistic.  However, starting a process is never something spectacular where one gets a big-bang solution.  Hence, I am not trying to sell the summit here as a game-changing event because that was never the aim.  Its purpose was not to craft a master plan for Europe because we cannot start a new grand design without solving the most pressing issues.  It was all about starting a new process, reflecting the new circumstances.  If members look at the declaration in the roadmap, they will find that the leaders conveyed several important messages that make the Bratislava summit a success.   To name a few, it was a strong political message of unity, it was a realistic recognition of weak spots and an agreement on concrete steps forward in the reflection process.<\/p><p> As for the process, let us stop looking for analogies.  Let us not talk about the Swiss, Norwegian or other models.  Future EU-UK relations will not copy any of the current models of the EU's co-operation with other states.  The UK is leaving the EU.  That is a unique situation and that is why future EU-UK relations will be unique.  It will not only be the final agreement with the UK that is important but also the negotiations process itself and the overall atmosphere during it.  It is obvious that there are political forces on both sides of the English Channel who may abuse EU-UK talks for their own domestic agendas, but the good news is that - members can take this from me as a representative of Slovakia - a peaceful divorce, a soft Brexit or whatever we want to call it, is possible.  We, as Slovaks, have an authentic right to say so.  We have had our authentic experience.  We made a valid divorce between the Czechs and Slovaks and the important element of it was the process.  Slovakia had a positive experience in the context of the splitting up of the Czechoslovak Federation, regardless of the many emotions and temptations to misuse the process.  The negotiations process was dominated by responsibility and good agreements.  Those settlements were favourable for both parties and, thus, later became an important base for the subsequent excellent relationships between the countries involved.<\/p><p> We are aware that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council have built teams for Brexit and appointed their own negotiators.  Michel Barnier was recently in Ireland and he will be in Bratislava in two days' time.  Each of these institutions will at certain points take part in the negotiations for the approval of the outcome and, furthermore, in many countries the final agreement with the UK will have to be ratified by the national parliaments.  Member states must have real influence and oversight of the process and the results of the negotiations.  Therefore, they have to agree on a correct negotiating mandate for the Commission.  The whole process should be completely transparent, with the full involvement of member states.  Further, it is important that there should be a regular reports on the progress of it.  For Slovakia, it is hard to overstate that member states must keep control of the negotiations process to the fullest extent possible.  Member states should be the decisive factor in the defining the parameters of a future EU-UK agreement.  <\/p><p> As for structures, an interdepartmental working group at the state secretary level from respective Slovak Ministries has been formed to analyse issues related to the United Kingdom's departure from the EU, similar to what is happening in Ireland or the Netherlands.  The task force in our case is led by our Minister for Europe, who is the state Minister at the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs.  The task force will focus on identifying sensitive areas of Brexit and on analysing its potential impact on Slovakia.<\/p><p> We note British statements about Article 50 being triggered by the end of March 2017.  At this point, it should become also clear what relationship the UK wants to establish with the EU.  Within the time left, the EU should prepare for negotiations in terms of the internal process.  We need to ensure that the entire process is under control from the very beginning so as to avoid doubts or misunderstandings for citizens and business. To achieve the common goals of the EU 27, we have to maintain unity among member states.  We will not accept any cherry-picking during the negotiations with the UK.  Access to the Single Market requires acceptance of all four freedoms, including the free movement of persons and the financial contribution for this access.  We do not see any room for compromises there.  After leaving the EU, the UK will not go anywhere; it will continue to be one of the closest political and trade partners of the EU.  Therefore, it is important to keep the UK as close to the Union as possible.  However, there should a clear distinction and added value between being a member and not being a member of the EU.

I have a few questions and I will conclude with a few points on which I hope there is general, if not 100%, agreement.<\/p> <p>  Ambassador Schellekens, said that Ireland and the Netherlands are absolutely natural partners in this process.  Through our history of European relations since Ireland entered the then EEC in 1973, we have demonstrated that in respect of a number of issues, as have the Belgians and those in the UK.  One of my greatest concerns - and I picked this concern up from what Ambassador Matulay said at the end of his contribution - is that the negotiations, once Article 50 is triggered, could be used as an excuse to be slightly vengeful.  We are annoyed with the UK for taking this decision.  I am very annoyed with the people and the Government of the UK for ever allowing this to happen.  However, we cannot shoot ourselves in the foot by seeking to make an example of the UK and trying to punish it excessively because that is something that could damage the entire EU as well as ourselves.<\/p><p>There is concern that too good a deal could give confidence to certain governments in the EU not represented at this meeting and certain parties that have the potential to achieve power in upcoming elections.  I am very wary of statements to the effect that we must have 100% endorsement of all four freedoms.  One priority must be to maintain the highest level of trading co-operation between the EU 27 and the UK post-Brexit.  We really need to be open to considering our red-line issues in that regard.  Even before entering negotiations, we must have an element of flexibility because countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have the most to lose if we decide to go for a harsh deal and be too forceful on the matter of trading.  We have to allow the UK as much access to the Single Market as possible, otherwise I fear growing levels of euroscepticism will become quite powerful in that area of western Europe where they have not necessarily taken hold so far.  How would the governments of both witnesses take a position on that?<\/p><p> Another concern both ambassadors mentioned is the rise of growing euroscepticism.  All around the world today, being the day that is in it, anti-globalisation and anti-free trade movements are growing and the narrative is becoming increasingly insular for many countries.  In return, I would argue that over the past ten years in particular, the EU has not helped itself.  It has become increasingly aloof, bureaucratic and removed from the citizens of Europe, as opposed to from the European Commission, so I wonder how both ambassadors feel this can be addressed.  How do we return the EU to being a wholly positive entity, which I believe it is, and how do we project that image of the EU so we can really attack and dampen down the rising levels of euroscepticism?<\/p><p> I would like to ask Ambassador Matulay specifically the extent of the Slovak diaspora in the UK.  What is its population level?  He mentioned that there are future opportunities for the Slovak Republic with the UK outside the EU regarding Range Rover.  If he is able, maybe he could expand on that and consider other areas for all European countries, especially those in central and eastern Europe which perhaps have less of an historical relationship with the UK than has Ireland.<\/p><p> Before moving on to one of my colleagues, one reason referred to in our own discussions on bringing the ambassadors and representatives of the other 27 member states before the committee was that it would be an opportunity both to hear from them and to discuss and lay out the priorities we feel, as Irish parliamentarians, should be going into the negotiation process.  Our No. 1 priority absolutely has to be North-South relations and I appreciate that both witnesses mentioned that point.  The Border has become literally a line on a map.  A return to a hard Border is not only something we feel would be damaging economically, but it could also have a huge impact on the fragile peaceful situation we have on this island.  We have come a long way in a short period, and many people have invested a lot of time and have made a lot of political sacrifices to make that happen.  The second priority is the retention of free movement between Ireland and the UK, which has been in place since 1922 and has to remain.  The third priority, which I stressed at the start of my contribution, is to maintain the highest level of access to the Common Market for the UK in order to allow us to continue to trade as freely as possible, even though we will no longer be able to trade as freely as if the UK remained within the EU.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to a couple of matters that are a little parochial but which the Irish Government is addressing on a European basis, and we would appreciate it were the ambassadors able to bring them back to their national governments.  I refer to the fact that Ireland has applied to be considered as a future location for both the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.  We would appreciate any encouragement from the European representatives in the Irish State to see that these would be great opportunities both for Ireland, the country that absolutely will suffer the most from Brexit, and for these agencies to continue to thrive.<\/p><p> We also have considerable concerns about the latest round of discussions on a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, and the fact that it is coming back on the agenda.  It is a huge issue for Ireland, as I know it is for the Slovak Republic.  I fear that if the European centralised authorities and certain larger member states continue to push that, it would be to the detriment of the pro-European feeling in smaller member states across the EU.<\/p><p> Finally, we need to look at how we might do our trade deals better.  I was delighted to see the approval of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, but it was done with much difficulty.  The opposition to it is a huge warning ahead of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations, which are in their 15th round.  We have no control over what will happen later tonight, but we have to put the EU on the best footing to get as many good trade deals with as many partners as possible across the world.  In order to do that, we have to make sure that the European authorities and member state governments approach these trade deals in a new manner to make sure there are increased levels of transparency, communication and buy-in from civic society, as well as the business community and the labour movement.<\/p><p> I thank both witnesses for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#E00300","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I very much welcome both ambassadors and thank them for their presentations.  I am very concerned by all the issues raised by my colleague, Senator Richmond, and my comments will follow on from what he said.  We have a unique relationship with Britain, which the witnesses acknowledge and which has existed since the foundation of our State.  I understand the United Kingdom's Ireland Act 1949 provided that in a unique relationship, we would not be considered a foreign country in Britain.  Mr. Matulay seems to indicate that Slovakia will take a very hard stance on the four freedoms.  Given that there seems to be agreement between the Irish and British Governments and accepted in the North that we could almost have a bilateral arrangement and that we would seek the blessing of the EU and all of its member states in that regard, does he not see any room for compromise on the four freedoms?  I noticed from Prime Minister May's visit to India that the question of visas came up.  I think the UK will need a larger workforce and it will have to give something in return for that.<\/p> <p>  We all will wish to hold Britain in the Single Market if possible.  In the context of the Netherlands, its elections next year and the fact that the UK might not have triggered Article 50 by then, I am not too sure of the precise date of the elections, but how will the various parties in the Netherlands react to that?  Coming into that mix will be the fact that there will be a Supreme Court decision in Britain, presumably by early next year, and we think at the moment that it is likely it will uphold the High Court decision.  How does Mr. Schellekens see that playing into the mix?  Because of the Netherlands being, like Ireland, so close to the UK, what opportunities does he see when the UK is gone?  What are the main priorities of the Netherlands?  Presumably the Netherlands, like Ireland, wants the UK to have access to the Single Market, but achieving that in the negotiations seems to be the difficulty.  However, as I think the Netherlands and Ireland have common agendas, I would be very interested in Mr. Schellekens' views and indeed the views of both witnesses as to their vision for a future without Britain in the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#F00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassadors and thank them for their dissertations.  I wish to raise a number of matters, the first of which is the duration of the negotiations that are likely to place from the moment they are activated.  There is likely to be a considerable shift in movement in the markets right across Europe that will be affected by the negotiations at various stages and the duration of the negotiations may have a negative impact on various countries which we have not yet anticipated.  To what extent do the witnesses see something like that happening?  For instance, we see already the shift in the value of the pound against the euro and negotiations have not taken place at all yet.  In the course of the negotiations, those differences are likely to be accentuated.  As the Chairman knows, I have always held the view that there should be one currency throughout the European Union.  I believe that for a union to work effectively, just as in the United States, the necessity for one currency was obvious from the very beginning.  There is a presumption on the part of some commentators that it is better to have different currencies within a union.  It does not work that way, unfortunately, nor is it likely to work that way in the future.  Regarding the countries outside the European Union but within the continent of Europe and the trading areas, there are likely to be huge pitfalls when dealing with the same trading people as in the past, which will impact negatively on one or the other, as the case may be.  To what extent has that been anticipated?<\/p> <p>  Reference has already been made to the necessity for what is called a soft Border on this island.<\/p><p>I do not know how feasible that is or how it would work because I cannot understand how one can have a Union and at the same time have no Union and breaches in the Union.  If that were the case every country within the Union would seek to avail of breaches to suit their particular circumstances, especially if there are fluctuations in the markets affecting one or the other.  A crisis might develop very quickly and the situation might come to a head.<\/p><p> Has anybody thought of any situation whereby, in the event of one or two years down the road there might be such dramatic movement in the markets as to make it very serious for the entire European Union, with a view to knocking heads together once again and inquiring whether this is a great idea?  I have in mind the writings of John Donne, \"No Man is an Island\".  Everybody should read that very carefully.  I will not do it now but I have done it many times in the past.  It is not a long poem but it was written a long time ago and it has more meaning now than it ever had before.  I emphasise the lines, \"If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less\".  That is a very poignant phrase in the poem and it has real meaning for us now.<\/p><p> I wish to make two other quick points.  Much has been made of opportunities that might exist for other countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands and various others.  We would be very foolish to assume there would not be an undignified brawl across Europe to encourage relocation of facilities from the UK.  That would not augur well for either the UK, the European Union or for the individual member states of the European Union.  To what extent has that been anticipated?  Everybody will see the opportunities for themselves at a particular time.<\/p><p> I have a point relating to smaller countries, which to my mind have more to fear from a broken down European Union.  The reason for the Common Market in the first place was very obvious.  It came at a time when the attention of Europeans was focused as a result of a particular tragedy, one we hope we will never have to face again.  It concentrated people&rsquo;s minds then.  There was a period of relative peace across Europe, of previously unknown duration.  Perhaps people have got tired of peace, quiet and progress and they think there are better things.  My colleague mentioned the possibility of people resiling from globalisation.  To my mind, the real issue has been a downturn in the global economy.  The world economies have taken a sharp downturn and the people of Europe, those within the European Union and outside of it, and across the globe have taken a hit in recent times.  At such times people have been known to become restless and out of that restlessness sometimes people make very foolish mistakes.  To what extent has the diplomatic service evaluated the potential danger in the direction in which we are going?<\/p><p> Another point is one I have mentioned on many previous occasions.  Everybody wants to feel they should nationalise Europe, which I presume means nationalising to their own idea of what it should be.  Until such time as we as Europeans &ndash; we are all Europeans &ndash; recognise and seriously espouse the concept that we are Europeans and we have something to offer to Europe as well as something to take away, we should not for one moment allow ourselves to be encouraged away from what has worked extremely well.  There are those who say it was not perfect, and it was not, but I warn people to consider what the alternative might be.  I will leave it to them to decide that for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#F00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Most of the questions have been asked at this stage but I will pick up on a few points.  I thank the two ambassadors for their presentations and for enlightening us on the positions of their respective countries on the forthcoming negotiations on Brexit.  The ambassador from the Netherlands in particular spoke about the close economic, social and cultural and political ties between his country and the UK.  It is the same here.  Both ambassadors raised concerns, which we share, about barriers to trade being erected and also our respective communities living in the UK.  Those are issues that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that both ambassadors agreed with the President of the European Commission and others that access by the UK to the Single Market will involve adherence to the four freedoms.  There are difficult negotiations ahead.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased that both ambassadors stated their appreciation of the Irish position on Brexit.  As Irish parliamentarians that is an issue we will raise at every opportunity.  We are all concerned about the barriers to trade, but as my colleagues mentioned, we are concerned in particular about the erection of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  We are also concerned about difficulties relating to the future of the common travel area and especially the position of the Northern Ireland peace process.  We are putting our case forward and I hope that some accommodation can be reached with Ireland because of those unique circumstances.  Leaving trade aside, I hope the other issues involving North-South relations will be recognised by all the member states of the European Union in the discussions and by the Commission as well and the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the briefing on the Slovak Presidency.  The ambassador has been in on a previous occasion.  We wish him well.  We followed the progress of the Bratislava Summit and the Brussels Summit and the Slovak Presidency is meeting the challenges, of which there are many, facing the European Union, and they are being worked through.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise is one other colleagues have also mentioned.  The Brexit vote did raise concerns about the future of the European Union and the European project.  We all recognise that the European Union has brought about peace and stability in Europe since the Second World War.  No doubt the ambassadors would appreciate that far more than we would on the outskirts of Europe.  That is a very positive thing.  However, as has been mentioned, there has been an increase in populism, extreme nationalism and the extreme left and right and opposition to globalisation.  They all relate to problems concerning sluggish economic growth, youth unemployment, disillusion with the European Union generally and the fact that it is seen as overly bureaucratic and not able to communicate its message well.  They are all problems that have led to euroscepticism.  I am interested to hear what the position is in each of the ambassadors' respective countries in terms of support for the European Union.  Generally speaking, Irish people are supportive of the European Union but that cannot be taken for granted the way global trends are going.  I wish to hear about the level of domestic popular support for the European Union in the respective countries of the ambassadors.  Perhaps they could indicate whether that is under threat given the global trends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#G00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassadors and thank them for attending.  I wish to start with a point that was made by the ambassador from the Netherlands.  During his presentation he said &ldquo; if the UK leaves the European Union&rdquo;, which is something that is quite common among all of us who are watching what is happening in terms of Brexit.  There is a vague hope that in some way this is an exercise that will fall flat on its face.  That argument got oxygen during the week when the courts said the issue must go back to the UK Parliament before triggering Article 50.  Is that something the ambassador believes himself or is it an indication of a vague hope held by the Netherlands?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about workers from other countries in the United Kingdom.  It would horrify us to think that workers would in some way have to be enumerated and a census taken of foreign workers in the United Kingdom in a post-Brexit era.  That is something on which I would welcome the views of the ambassadors.<\/p><p>I would particularly like to hear their views on the question of the citizens' rights that have come through European legislation over the many years since the European Union was expanded to take in Britain and Ireland.<\/p><p> We talk about a soft and a hard Brexit.  Every official I have spoken to and most politicians say we are aiming for a soft Brexit and that this is what we all want.  However, when we look at Article 50 and what is required to commence the process, it appears we need all of the leaders of all of the 27 states to agree, we need 20 of the 27 national parliaments to ratify the process and we need a simple majority of the European Parliament to pass the process before we engage in negotiations.  To me, that spells horror.  There are just too many strings to that bow, too many different things that can go wrong along the way.  If we do not get an agreed platform on which to commence negotiations within the next two years, then we are headed for a train crash, and that is the simple fact of the matter.  I would be interested to know from the witnesses' experience whether either of their countries, prior to the referendum, modelled how they think a Brexit or any exit would go and how they think the triggering of Article 50 would be handled in the event of any country seeking to leave.<\/p><p> We talk about there being no negotiation without the four freedoms.  We have immediately laid down criteria that, if a country is not prepared to sign up to the four freedoms, we are not really interested in a lot of what the country has to say.  Maybe I am picking that up wrong but I would welcome the witnesses' views on it.<\/p><p> I am interested in the vision of both countries for a post-Brexit EU.  We need to have some vision as to where we are going right across Europe.  Deputy Durkan referred to the fate of smaller countries, which are at risk as we go into this process.<\/p><p> I attended a conference recently where we spoke about Brexit and, shortly after that discussion, the issue of a European army came up.  As the witnesses know, a European army is anathema to the Irish Constitution, so we would have a difficulty with that and we may signal another exit if that particular agenda proceeds.  I am interested to know what is the view of the Netherlands and Slovakia on the European army, or whether it is something they have considered.<\/p><p> On trade, Senator Richmond mentioned TTIP and CETA.  The witnesses will be familiar with their own citizens on the ground.  The secrecy that exists around these trade negotiations has made the EU the monster it is seen to be by Joe Public.  There may be great deals but they are viewed with suspicion by citizens.<\/p><p> This brings me on to the next point.  We are members of the European Union.  Deputy Haughey noted the Irish people are very favourably disposed towards the EU.  However, while we are favourably disposed to the roads it has built and the various other things it has funded, I am not too sure any of us feel we are Europeans.  The reason for this, and I wonder if it applies in the witnesses' countries, is that we go to Brussels, sit with the Commission and negotiate hard for our country, and we then come home and blame the Commission for whatever came out of the negotiations.  We do not accept responsibility that we actually negotiated where we are going.<\/p><p> The negotiations we engage in tend to be an attempt at one-size-fits-all.  The issues of the Netherlands are not the same as the issues of west Connemara and the issues of Amsterdam are not the issues that Dublin or Bratislava faces.  If we want to maintain a European Union and if we want to kill off what is euphemistically known as populism, we have to get back to the citizens.  In his last visit here, the Slovak ambassador mentioned that this was one of the main issues for the Slovak Government during its EU presidency term, namely, to get back to the citizens.  Brexit has put us in a situation where, if we do not get back to the citizens and if we do not become truly committed Europeans, this entire process - the entire Union - is on the high road to disaster.  Brexit has given oxygen to everybody who ever wanted to destroy something that was, to my mind, very good.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses' for taking the time to listen to me.  I look forward to their replies on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#G00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat agus f&aacute;ilte.  The idea of today's meeting was to tease out ideas among ourselves and I do not know if this format is the best route.  I listened to both submissions.  The witnesses said the position is that there are huge challenges and we are into a difficult period, and that no negotiations are going to happen until Article 50 is triggered.  I would like to focus on what we are to do before then.  We know it is coming down the track and there is no doubt it is going to happen, so what do we do?<\/p><p>H. E. Mr. Schellekens said:<\/p><blockquote>Further consequences loom for this beautiful island if Brexit sees a return to the borders of the past.  Of course, the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a sensitive issue.  We fully understand this and we believe this should be taken into account when negotiations begin.<\/blockquote> <p>We all agree with that.  If we can agree that the Border is a particular difficultly for us, what can we do during this study period, if we want to call it that, or this false dawn before whatever happens down the track?  For example, would it be helpful if the different EU states came to look at the Border, the Irish peace process and the positive involvement of the EU in regard to that process?  We need to be build up a greater awareness among EU members in regard to the potential crisis that will impact on Ireland and its people.<\/p><p>People talked about borders but it is not just the physical borders but also the psychological borders.  One of the successes of the Good Friday Agreement is that, in many ways, we have eliminated those.  There is now co-operation and we work on an all-island basis to sell Ireland, and there is co-operation when Ministers from the North and from this jurisdiction travel to Europe, for example.  Do the witnesses see that as a possibility after the British exit?  We talked in terms of flexibility and, as an example of that, Denmark is a member but Greenland is outside the Union and still receives EU funding.  The EU became an active persuader for reunification in Germany.  In the event of Cypriot reunification, Northern Cyprus will be fully integrated within the EU and its seats in the European Parliament are currently allocated on the basis of the populations in both areas.  Therefore, there is flexibility.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses believe a similar flexibility or arrangement could apply for Ireland?  In particular, under the Good Friday Agreement, there is the inherent right of those born on the island of Ireland to be Irish citizens and, by virtue of that, to have citizenship of the EU.  Do the witnesses believe it would be helpful if there was an all-Ireland approach to these negotiations involving those in the Northern Assembly and the Government here?  Do the witnesses believe those in the British jurisdiction who want to remain within the EU - those in the North and in Scotland - are in a unique position in regard to these negotiations?  Would it be helpful if there was a common position coming from them?<\/p><p>I am looking at and listening to people coming from the Welsh Parliament.  There was a majority in Wales and they feel very strongly about what is facing them.  I am seeking ideas about what we can do in this interim period.  Is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s civic forum helpful?  Are the witnesses following it?  Would it be helpful to forward those civic society discussions to EU members?  I would be interested in teasing out such ideas today and seeing what we are missing out.  We are trying to bring people in and have the discussion.  The difficulty is that although everyone is waiting for the trigger to happen, we could do much in the interim.  Do the witnesses agree?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#H00200","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478624400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome both ambassadors and we thank them for their presentations.  Given that I am the last speaker, most points have been made.  The UK vote to leave the EU is unique to Ireland.  We would be very parochial advocating the point for all the reasons my colleagues outlined.  It is very important the message is reinforced, given that we will need particular assistance under a number of areas such as trade, business and currency.  While there have been many positive benefits and countries have done exceptionally well from being members of the EU and the eurozone, do the witnesses feel part of the negativity to the EU is because the EU is seen as disconnected from the people, is operating largely as a dictatorship and has policies that are not practical or fundamental to particular countries or zones where a one-for-all may not exactly fit, and people are feeling a bit annoyed about it?  Is this giving people who are opposed to the EU an opportunity to advocate?  In the recent UK referendum on Brexit, the EU sceptics who promoted Brexit are no longer to be seen as a fall-back position as to what to do and where their county goes from here and to be involved in the process.  Is the vacuum that has been created being fed into by the negativity and disconnect that is coming through from the EU?  As a national politician and a public representative, no matter where I go, I pick it up a lot.  In my previous job, when I travelled through Europe, I picked up that people felt there was a major disconnect and a problem, and that if it were not addressed, there would be more scepticism.<\/p> <p>  There is a major issue in the constituency I represent.  The food business is a major industry in Ireland and exports are a large part of it.  This applies throughout Ireland, including in my area.  There is a major problem with exports to the UK or going through the UK.  I have raised it here before.  The exchange rate is leaving it very difficult for companies to export and they are not in a position to go after the differential.  As a result, there is a problem.  How can this be dealt with for sustainability while the vacuum exists as the UK leaves the EU?  My colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, who is not here, has previously raised the issue of having an Irish representative on the negotiating team regarding the UK leaving the EU to articulate the difficulties, problems and complexities that affect Ireland.  There are many major sensitivities that will affect Ireland.  What are the witnesses' view and should it be advocated to assist in a positive way to try to deal with the fallout of what has just taken place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#J00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478624400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Those are a lot of observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2016110800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

All the other EU countries believe the four freedoms must be observed by countries that want to come into the Internal Market.<\/p> <p>  Almost all the members mentioned euroscepticism, and it plays out a lot in my country and in many other European countries, but not as much here in Ireland.  One hardly hears remarks that the EU is not good and that it should be different.  It is my personal opinion that euroscepticism among the voters is also inspired by politicians who tend to say the EU should do more of something or less of something, but never say the EU has been very good to them and still is and is very important.  They only mention the things they do not like, thinking this is appealing to voters.  This is my impression.  While I do not hear it here, it is the case in my country and other European countries.<\/p> <p>  Trade relations and the currency might be a major problem for the years to come.  My personal opinion is that after Brexit, things will calm down, eventually.  The Netherlands and Ireland have important trade relations with the US, which is not part of the EU, which has its own currency which can go up and down, and yet trade relations remain very good.  This will also be the case, eventually, after Brexit.  I said \"if\" the UK leaves.  It was not on purpose.  One could say \"when\".  I did not use the word \"if\" to have a positive outlook, although one never knows what might happen.  There might be another referendum or other elections in the UK, and Brexit might not happen.

For instance, Deputy Crowe asked what will happen in between.  Commissioner Barnier was here.  There is a lot of talk going on.  The Parliament also appointed its negotiation team.  The triggering of Article 50 does not mean we are frozen and not moving.  That is what we are not doing.  A lot is happening in Ireland, Slovakia and the Netherlands.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to set out some of the views and concerns of business on this crucial issue.  As members know, IBEC is the country&rsquo;s largest business organisation and the voice of Irish business on a domestic, European and international level.  We are working to support member companies right across the country and in all sectors as they manage the immediate currency shock and plan for the potential significant disruption that Brexit could bring to existing trading relationships.<\/p> <p>  Many individual businesses have been slow to talk publicly but the feedback from our members is clear and unambiguous.  Businesses are under threat and jobs have already been lost.  While companies are moving quickly to manage severe competitive pressures, an urgent, targeted national response is also required.  The exporting industries most affected by the sterling fall are typically jobs-intensive and deeply embedded in local economies.  This adds to the risk that some parts of the country will be disproportionately hit.  A review of the historical exchange rate and agrifood exports, for example, shows that a 1% weakness in sterling results in a 0.7% drop in Irish exports to the UK.  This has already begun.  Our most recent trade figures for the year to August showed the value of Irish food exports to the UK fell by 8.1% annually.  This represents an 18 percentage point downturn on the 10% growth in value recorded in 2015.  This fall accelerated to 14.5% annually in the two months since the referendum and has hit all categories.  If sterling stays at the &pound;0.90 mark to the euro for a protracted period, which is quite likely, this is likely to translate into losses of over &euro;700 million in food exports and potentially about 7,500 Irish jobs.  The retail sector is also particularly exposed as we approach the crucial Christmas trading period.  Currency movements have significantly increased the attractiveness of shopping in the North or with UK online retailers, thus depriving domestic retailers of important business.  <\/p> <p>  In the brief time I have today, I want to outline some practical steps we need to take domestically to protect and advance Irish interests during this period of great uncertainty.  In the first instance, we need to focus on areas that are within our control.  Budget 2017 introduced some welcome measures to address the competitiveness challenge of Brexit but a more comprehensive policy response is now required.  IBEC will be setting out key domestic policy priorities for the Government over the coming days.  First, it is vital that greater efforts are made to help viable companies to come through the Brexit transition, retain UK market share and diversify.  This could run up against state aid obstacles in the short term but Ireland will need to make sure its special case is heard.  Second, an intense focus on cost competitiveness is required.  As sterling drops and competitive pressures increase we need to be wary of runaway increases in labour costs and take strategic decisions which could avoid increasing already high costs on businesses in areas such as energy, regulation and insurance.<\/p><p>Third, potential trade restrictions post-Brexit and the more preferable tax treatment of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in the UK raise the possibility of Irish SMEs servicing that market from within the UK itself rather than by exporting from Ireland.  As such, the need to level the playing field in the tax offering for indigenous business has never been more urgent.  Whereas changes in the budget were welcome, they did not go far enough.  As we look to the medium term and some of the opportunities which may come our way, we need to ramp up public investment far beyond current plans and put in place a quality education system, public transport network, housing and public services needed to attract new investment and compete in a post-Brexit world.<\/p><p> Finally, the risks from Brexit will weigh heavily on the regions.  If we do not wish inequality of economic activity to expand post-Brexit we will need to address infrastructure deficits in the regions.  Key projects need to be expedited.  My colleague, Mr. Gerard Brady from the IBEC economics team, is with me today and will be happy to talk through some of these issues in more detail.  Early next year, the UK will trigger Article 50 and begin formal exit negotiations.  Ireland must play a central, collaborative and constructive role in what is likely to be a fraught process.  A hard Brexit, with the imposition of tariffs, restrictive rules on migration and the resulting disruption to trade flows, investment and the regulatory environment, would be deeply damaging to business and economic interests.  For this reason it is important to Irish business that the UK retains access to the single market on grounds as close to full membership as possible.  We need to support these efforts in negotiations.  The political settlement in the North needs to be afforded a special status, along with a continued commitment to the development of the all-island economy.  The common travel area between the UK and Ireland must be preserved.  Notwithstanding the profound challenges that Brexit presents, it is vital that we sustain and build on the very positive and mutually beneficial relationship we currently enjoy with the UK.  I thank the committee for its time and we look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arnold Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for inviting me to give evidence on this very important issue.  For those who do not know us, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce is the only organisation representing business activities with interests across our two islands.  Our <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre<\/i>is to champion, protect and grow the trade between the UK and Ireland, which is worth in excess of &euro;60 billion a year and sustains over 400,000 jobs, evenly spread across Britain and Ireland.  The UK is Ireland's largest two-way trading partner, supplying 34% of our imports and taking 16% of our exports.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce works on behalf of its members, large and small, North, South, east and west, connecting them to fresh business opportunities between and from these two islands, growing trade, investment and jobs.  We want to ensure that this work continues beyond the current political crisis that now faces us.<br\/><br\/>As the only organisation representing business interests in both Ireland and the UK, we are uniquely placed to see both the opportunities and challenges that Brexit provides, and there are both.  Currently we are seeing one of the challenges take shape in the form of the collapse in the value of sterling.  Fluctuations in currency are nothing new but the speed with which sterling has declined has caused a significant challenge for our exporters, particularly those in the agrifood sector who already operate with very tight margins.  The reality is that governments cannot magic away the serious impact of sterling's weakening on Irish exporters.  It is also not realistic to expect that businesses can simply open new markets that are slow, expensive and just plain awkward to trade with, compared with the ease of doing business with our nearest and most similar neighbours.  This is why I believe the best response to this challenge is to help our trading businesses to do even more together to offset unit value changes.  Most of them have scope to do just that if we can use our support resources to connect them to more partners, as my colleagues in the British Irish Chamber of Commerce are actively doing.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, the chamber is also working to help Irish businesses to secure a base within their nearest neighbour to protect themselves from any future barriers to trading with the UK.  With 53% of the UK's imports already coming from EU member states, there is substantial opportunity for Irish suppliers to replace some of that trade on a tariff-free basis by establishing directly within the UK sooner rather than later.  We should not waste a good crisis and there are certainly opportunities from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU that Ireland should be availing of.  In the short term, we are assisting UK firms to manage their need to secure an in-EU base for the future by establishing relationships or a base for their business activities within Ireland, as the best alternative base among the various bids for their business by competing EU countries.  We are also assisting other foreign direct investors to prefer Ireland over alternative locations.  We are working to assist Irish universities to benefit by partnering with British and Northern Irish universities to win valuable EU-funded research contracts for the future.<br\/><br\/>We need to have a well-founded national strategic plan if we are to take best advantage of these opportunities.  Brexit clearly hands Ireland a role to be a key base for both global foreign direct investment and UK-based firms and agencies.  The Government's decision to campaign for the relocation of the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority is welcomed by the chamber and is something that we have been active in supporting.  We are also working with national and local government to ensure fastest delivery of key resources such as housing, offices, international schools and regulator capacity.<br\/><br\/>There are very real opportunities for Ireland in the likes of the education and research sector.  By leaving the EU, the UK will cut itself off from &pound;1 billion per year in EU funding of its universities and research institutions.  If we adopt a genuinely strategic planning approach together, Ireland can position itself as a potential base within the EU for those researchers who are facing loss of their lead role on key research programmes or indeed outright exclusion from pan-European research consortia.  In order to achieve this we must ensure we reverse the current trend that sees our universities slipping down the global rankings through implementation of the Cassells report without delay.  This really is not the time to play party politics with a vital national resource and I urge all sides to grab this opportunity so we can emerge strengthened by opportunity rather than diminished by loss.<br\/><br\/>To get the best from Brexit, Ireland must look to our visionaries of the past, such as T.K. Whitaker, for inspiration.  Just 50 years ago, Ireland faced huge decisions from a much weaker base.  Not long independent, impoverished by a trade war with our neighbour and exporting our young alongside our animals, we had missed out on the industrial revolution and we had no natural resources other than our food, our brains and our work rate.  The choices made by our predecessors then shaped what we are now as a vibrant, resilient people, an economy and a community that has paid its dues and which now features the best growth rate in the EU.<br\/><br\/>We should think carefully now about what we would want our successors to say in 50 years about the choices we get to make now.  Brexit is a catalyst for a national strategic plan to guide our success and collective well-being for some generations to come.  We should work together now and look forward with ambition, optimism and faith in our collective abilities.  We should not only address the challenges and opportunities of the immediate aftermath of the UK people's decision to leave the EU but we should also ask why and what has changed to make a strong nation so decide.  Armed with that understanding, we can and must work together in our common interest knowing that we may be the first generation to be able to deliver comprehensive local and even universal well-being or the last to be given the chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Chambers Ireland is the largest business network in the State.  With members in every geographic region and economic sector in Ireland, we are well positioned to understand the concerns of businesses from all areas in the country and represent their views.  We also work very closely with our chambers in other jurisdictions.  The Northern Irish chamber is a member of Chambers Ireland and we are working very closely with it as we see that work as valuable.  We are also working extremely closely with European Chambers of Commerce to profile the case for Ireland within this Article 50 and subsequent negotiations.  I also welcome the opportunity to be able to bring Mr. Paddy Malone, the public relations officer of the Dundalk chamber, to the meeting as he can give us a real sense of what is happening on the ground in Border areas that will be most impacted immediately and in future.  With that in mind, I will pull some extracts from my supplied submission to ensure Mr. Malone gets some time to speak.<\/p> <p>  Following the UK's vote in June to exit the European Union, there continues to be a large degree of uncertainty as to what will happen next.  We have already seen significant market and currency volatility and we have a great concern about the lack of understanding about whether the departure will also entail leaving the Single Market and the customs union as well as the consequent impact.  It is also very clear that the interruption and likely reduction in trade between Ireland and the UK will have a disproportionate impact on our indigenous firms, especially our exporting SMEs, which are very reliant on the UK as a primary market.  There are also supply chain issues for Irish companies that may not even realise they have an exposure in this area.<\/p> <p>  We have been very vocal over the past few years about the need of the Irish economy to retain competitiveness to grow and that remains more important than ever.  Due to the existence of a land Border between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, the Irish position is unique.  Mr. Malone will address issues such as the number of people transferring across the Border day in, day out just to do their jobs.<\/p> <p>  From our network of chambers there is a sense that Brexit will provide some opportunities for Ireland.  If we can enhance Ireland's competitiveness relative to the UK and other EU member states, we may well see the opportunity for foreign direct investment companies choosing to locate operations here as well as expand indigenous companies.<\/p><p>While we cannot control the negotiations or the effects of Brexit, we can ensure Ireland is an attractive location for investment and continues to be an excellent environment in which to do business.  In that regard, we need to focus on competitiveness and infrastructure, to invest in our transport network, education and training systems, as well as on the cost competitiveness of our enterprises, particularly costs which can be impacted by the Government, child care costs and housing.<\/p><p>  We do not believe it was ever possible to Brexit-proof a budget as we do not know what Brexit will involve.  We would like to see, however, a focus on credit export, how we can free up new credit opportunities and different products used in different parts of the world, including export credit guarantee schemes, to help companies export into new markets.  We also call on the Government and elected representatives to support the European Commission's trade strategy.  Trade agreements with the US and Canada will be necessary.<\/p><p> We accept the UK exit from the EU is only one part of a much broader set of challenges to the EU economy such as migration, youth unemployment and climate change.  We must make great efforts to communicate the uniqueness of our situation going forward.  The Government cannot solve this in isolation.  The private sector stands ready to add its support.  We have to control the controllables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it.  Dundalk is more exposed than any other town to Brexit.  To emphasise how important this issue is to Dundalk, Thursday is the tax deadline and, as I am a chartered accountant, I had to work until 4 o'clock this morning to be here today.  Last year, I addressed an Oireachtas committee on the all-Ireland economy.  Its report came out in January and much of the work done in it is of relevance to this committee's deliberations.<\/p> <p>  The issues I wish to raise are local, as distinct from the national issues which have already been raised.  Every day, 3,000 commuters travel back and forward across the Border in our region.  Across the entire Border, 30,000 people commute.  They are attracted to PayPal, eBay and others on the southern side and to First Derivatives, Glen Dimplex and others on the northern side.  What time does one leave work to pick up the kids from a cr&egrave;che if one is going to encounter a PSNI, Garda or customs checkpoint?  This will disrupt the whole region and the way it works.  We are trying to integrate the region between Newry and Mourne District Council and Louth County Council.  The first memorandum of understanding between two local authorities from two jurisdictions was signed between these two councils.  This is a development of which we are proud but now it will be demolished.<\/p> <p>  Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, will face significant delays, and subsequently extra transportation costs if they have to cross the Border.  This will also bring challenges to the supply chains which already exist.  Instead of looking to the North or the South, we are going to lose trade automatically with that situation.<\/p> <p>  We are worried about the PEACE IV dividend.  The British Government has said it will stop sanctioning PEACE IV projects beyond 2019.  We are seriously concerned that the peace process has not been embedded sufficiently to allow it to stop prematurely like that.<\/p> <p>  We are already aware of one research project in Dundalk working in conjunction with a Portuguese research institute and Queen's University Belfast.  The Portuguese institute has indicated that if Queen's University Belfast is going out of the EU, it will have to find a new partner.  While that might offer opportunities for other Irish universities, it similarly offers threats as well.  If we want to do research properly and develop the next generation of products, this has to be seriously tackled.<\/p> <p>  The retail sector will be decimated if sterling drops to between 90p and 93p to the euro.  We faced this problem since 1979, when the link with sterling and the punt was broken.  We faced it again in 2008 and 2009.  This one is different in that it could well last for a longer time.  We suggest central government introduces some form of rates remission scheme and direct subsidy into the Louth area.  At the moment, Louth has already the poorest collection of rates and Dundalk is the poorest within that.  Over 40% of rates have not been collected for years.<\/p> <p>  The SME support which Mr. Arnold Dillon spoke of is critical.  However, it should not be directed at export-oriented companies.  Companies in Dundalk effectively face import substitution by trying to tackle companies coming from Newry.  In the same way Enterprise Ireland and others are geared towards encouraging exports, an import substitution company serves the same purpose.  We would strongly recommend that the Government does not just look simply at export-oriented companies but considers small indigenous companies, which are the lifeblood of any town.<\/p> <p>  Dundalk is ranked number nine of the nine gateway towns in the Republic, based on a 2013 Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government report.  That cemented the findings of a report commissioned by Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and Louth County Council which showed Dundalk was the poorest of the nine gateways in 2011.  In that report, Newry was ranked the second poorest town in the North.  Only Strabane, which is the poorest in the UK, managed to beat it.  The area has been decimated by the serious underdevelopment of economic activity since 1920.  The one area which offers a chance for both areas, North and South, is its tourist potential, especially at Carlingford Lough.  However, it has been grossly underutilised.  Belfast thinks of Derry as a region.  Dublin thinks of Galway and Cork.  No one thinks of Louth or the North.  Up to 60% of the population is within an hour's drive of Carlingford Lough but its tourism potential is not well utilised.  If we are going to tackle Brexit, we need to think of Northern Ireland, the Border counties and how they are going to suffer.  That long-term dislocation is going to be significantly severe for the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for giving their time presenting to the committee.

The circumstances are that the syndicates that represent those research transactions already established under Horizon 2020 in the UK and other projects are consortia partnering doctoral researchers in particular universities.  The UK wins over &pound;1 billion worth a year of EU funding from that source and more industry-related co-funding for such projects.  It is not just that universities get the money - as we know from universities in Dublin and the regions - but that campuses for innovation spring up around the fact that serious research is being done on a given life science or technical project on a particular campus.  There is a complete ecosystem, namely, a cluster of enterprise and innovation fostered by the fact that there is a core research faculty on the campus.  In the UK's case, this is funded by EU money.  That money is up for grabs for projects that have already been approved but in respect of which funds have not yet been drawn down.

On another thought I have had, the delegates deal with both sides of the business.  Many businesses which import are seeing the upside of the sterling crisis.  Would it be possible to match some of these businesses, through a business incentive scheme, with sustainable businesses which are under serious pressure because of the fluctuations in sterling?  \"Tax break\" is a dirty phrase, but perhaps pairing or some other type of mechanism might be used to enable certain businesses to be matched, perhaps a stronger business with a weaker business which is struggling because of fluctuations in the sterling but which is not likely to go out of business.  They could be paired in some way to try to ride out the fluctuations.  Perhaps they might look at a joint return on a short-term basis.  Some of the businesses represented by all of the organisations before us are getting on well because of Brexit, while many others are suffering and on their knees.  Perhaps some type of incentive scheme might be rolled out by the Government to help weaker companies.

The reality is that smaller businesses are very exposed on the currency, which is an immediate concern.  I will roll this into the second part of the Senator's illustration.

For businesses exposed to the slump in sterling and exporting to the United Kingdom, Enterprise Ireland suggests developing other markets, but for the reasons I outlined, this is much slower than we would like.  The counter-intuitive solution is to do more business in the United Kingdom.  With organisations such as the chambers of commerce, we are instruments in introducing some firms to additional partner businesses on the UK side which can help them.  A very simple example is a call centre.  In this country we are very good at running call centres with which we service many major UK businesses.  They work on a margin of 15%.

Additional funding is required for market diversification.  This would allow companies to explore new markets and new opportunities in the context of potential new trade barriers being erected into the UK and to alleviate the existing currency barrier because of the fall in sterling.

A critical element of the plan is how to execute it, so that it does not just sit there.  We have to have it fully thought through and must come up with the interface between the private sector, the State and civic society to get the plan executed line by line.  Second, and this can be done right away, is to get an unambiguous message out internationally that Ireland is open for business.  Many people are spinning against Ireland, against Dublin and against the regions by saying that we could not take the new business as we do not have the offices, the houses, the schools and the regulatory capacity or the second runway for that matter.  We need to get out there and tell the world that we are wide open for business and the capacity that is needed for incremental business will be on-stream by the time that level of business can come here.  We need to bid for other agencies in addition to what we have done already such as the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.  There are many more such agencies in the United Kingdom.  We should not be shy, as other European capitals are bidding for these agencies and we should bid too.  We need to deliver the actual resources, such as housing.  The good work has started but we need to get on with it at an even faster rate.  We need to progress big infrastructure projects such as water for Dublin or a balanced water regime for Ireland as a whole that recognises that the whole country both has and needs water and to ensure that we are not thinking in the short term but in the long term as well for the future industrial policy and employment needs of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>We could replicate a lot of Mr. McGrane's list, but let me add that the national planning framework is critical and we need buy-in from all elements of society to deliver it.

We believe we need to put the right infrastructure in place to facilitate growth for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I call Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>First, well done to the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.  I am not a member of this committee but I sit in whenever I get an opportunity to attend the meetings.  The committee is inviting groups to discuss the potential economic impact of Brexit, which is really important.  I chair the only entrepreneurial organisation for the Thirty-two Counties of the North and South of Ireland.  We have 172,000 people employed and they are all in well paid work.  Frankly, we often resent broad-brush statements made from time to time on zero hours contracts and so on.  That may happen in some cases but it does not happen in the vast majority of cases.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about joined-up thinking.  I see the Chairman and members are pulling things together, which is really important but I am still very concerned about joined up thinking.  I believe many SMEs are looking at moving, in fact I chaired a board meeting this morning and a number of companies are looking at moving their base from Ireland to the UK.  For example, a company from Wexford with a staff of between 280 to 300 staff is moving their head office to the UK.  It is more effective for them to work from the United Kingdom than from Ireland because of the regulation, challenges and difficulties and the extra support that companies get in the UK and Northern Ireland.  I believe this is an issue that need to be seriously addressed because we will lose our indigenous companies.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses from IBEC and the chambers of commerce on tourism.  A significant issue in regard to tourism is that 42% of all the tourism income comes from the UK.  When one considers that the UK may be going into a semi-recession and that foreign exchange is going in the wrong direction for us, that will have a significant impact.  In my view this is particularly true for its impact on tourism businesses, such as bed and breakfasts, pubs, bars and so on in rural areas.  They are not able to avail of funding and support from Enterprise Ireland.  In that regard, what would the chambers of commerce and IBEC think of getting the SMEs which are members of their organisations to do a self-audit?  Have they a tool for a self-audit?  I accept that mentoring and so on is great on a one-to-one basis.  I believe if small businesses did a self-audit and reflected on it, one would see the trends in different regions, similar to Dundalk and the Border counties.  I am delighted that Mr. Paddy Malone is present.  It is fabulous that Mr. Malone is here, because he raised a particular case in point that needs to be looked at.  Quite frankly there are slightly different issues in different parts of Ireland.  I believe that IBEC, the Small Firms Association, ISME and the chambers of commerce are in an ideal position to carry out an audit and give the results to this committee, so that it can help us in the joined up thinking and making things happen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O00800","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Gerard Brady like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I will respond to the first two questions and Mr. Arnold Dillon will speak on the internal organisational work we are doing.<\/p> <p>  On the question of companies moving from Ireland to the United Kingdom, that is an issue that we have brought up again and again.  We tend to think of inward investment but we will see many growing companies, in particular mid-cap companies in the food sector that are thinking about their next steps, that will move by acquisition, partnership or expansion into the UK.  That is feedback we have been hearing loud and clear.  What can one do about that?  One issue is the size of the UK market, and there is nothing we can do about that apart from trying to get the best deal for the UK we can in the negotiations.  Tax is a major issue, in particular around capital gains tax, and the subjects of taxation of the self-employed and taxation share options have come up.<\/p> <p>  In regard to tourism, we are doing work that we will probably publish sometime before Christmas on the impacts on rural areas.  The impacts are very different depending on what region one is in.  The impact on the Border region will be very different from the south east, but they will both be severely impacted.  The retention of the 9% VAT rate will be a help but there will be pain, particularly in areas that were not traditional tourist areas but where there has been a great deal of recent promotion to attract tourists.  The promotion of the west has been successful but it will suffer because British tourists go into tourism areas that other tourists do not visit.  I think about 20% of the tourists visiting the midlands are UK-based but in Dublin, only 3% to 4% of tourist are from the UK.  <\/p> <p>  We will meet all our regional committees in the next couple of weeks.  We had the committees tell their experience to Deputies in the past couple of months.  At a business planning level. many companies have not got very far yet.  The more resources they have, the better prepared they are.<\/p><p>Hedging is probably the best example of it.  We conducted a survey of approximately 450 companies two weeks after the result.  Only 25% of exporters had cover, that is, hedging, pricing contracts, forward guidance on pricing, etc.  Most of that would only last three to 12 months from the time we surveyed them.  The first and second quarters of next year will see a great deal of pain.  People are protected where they have pricing contracts, but they tend to be the ones who export a lot.  They will have to start planning on how to deal with UK retailers in particular seeking price changes from them that will deeply affect them.  An increase in redundancies in the first and second quarters of next year is our expectation.  Mr. Dillon might discuss the internal aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#O01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":364,"content":"<p>As part of IBEC, we are trying to support companies by providing as much information as possible on what is happening.

Recently, it published a position paper on the development of infrastructure and tourism initiatives on the west coast.  That is the sort of work that we are trying to do.  Mr. Malone has mentioned already, and will continue to mention incessantly, the Carlingford area in Dundalk and how we have to treat it as a single region rather than two sides of the Border.  We are involved in trying to bring tourism initiatives and in opening up what Ireland has to markets other than Britain.  The chambers of commerce are focused on trying to establish links with their respective diasporas in other jurisdictions.

If subsidies or supports to export-oriented companies are being considered, companies involved in import substitution should also be considered.  A company in Dundalk that is stopping a business from Newry entering the area is equally as valuable as a company in Waterford that exports to France.  I have not seen this sort of thinking often when dealing with local enterprise offices, LEOs, or anything else.  I know of a company that is involved in import substitution, but it cannot get a grant.  It has been told unofficially by Enterprise Ireland to tell Enterprise Ireland that it can export.  The owner will not do that.  The company might be in a position to do so in five years' time, but it cannot do so now.  Any targeted approach to support SMEs cannot be targeted towards export-oriented companies only, particularly along the Border.<\/p> <p>  The self-audit idea is an excellent one.  I will revert on it.  Mr. Talbot and I agree that we will consider it.  We will pick up on the idea specifically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>It is understandable that we view the matter in terms of losing our indigenous companies, but we can save the Irish part of the business if we help part of it to be stronger in the UK.  If it does not take a strategic action like opening up some of its business, it may lose the rest of the business.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on Senator Reilly's question.  There is an opportunity, as many UK companies need to get a base inside the EU.  Some of our businesses have to save themselves by putting some of their operations inside the UK and, in compensation, there is tremendous opportunity for Ireland to be the next best EU alternative for UK-based businesses.<\/p> <p>  To add to the points made by others on tourism, Tourism Ireland is an all-island body.  We need to consider some of those structures born of the peace process and how they stand in a Brexited context.  In the meantime, they do excellent work.  There are one island, two countries and three tourism agencies.  Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way has worked well and runs all the way up the west coast.  Ireland's Ancient East seems to expect that, while the vikings did not stop at the Border, the tourists would.  We might consider what we are trying to do in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On a serious note, there are still plenty of English tourists coming to Ireland.  Center Parcs is opening a 1,000-job resort park in County Longford that no Irish business was going to open.  It is still intent on building that business to bring English tourists to Ireland over the long term.  We have plenty to offer.  We just need to work smarter and sell not on price, but on this island's unique experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McGrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and engaging with the committee.

As our submission is on the record, we do not intend to read through it.  The key risks we have identified from Brexit are currency fluctuation, access to credit and domestic competitiveness.  Allied to that, the potential departure of the UK from social chapter legislation would have a further effect on domestic and international competitiveness.  In that context, I remind the committee that at the current exchange rate, the UK minimum wage of &pound;7.20 equates to &euro;8.08.  It is obvious that each-way market access across the Border and into Great Britain is very important.  Our interests in negotiating the British tariff arrangements are not necessarily the same as the interests of our large trading partners on the Continent, such as France and Germany, because our export mix is not the same as the export mix of other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The extent to which a soft or hard Border and Border controls will be imposed will have an impact on access to the UK.  We ask the committee to bear in mind that it will also have an impact on transit from Donegal through Northern Ireland to Irish ports and on land-bridging through Great Britain.  It is clear that we do not want large-scale customs and tariffs to be imposed.  We are also concerned about the impact of Brexit on the action plan for jobs that was published previously.  In the longer term, we believe the Government must reconsider and reconfigure this country's policy in the area of foreign direct investment, bearing in mind Ireland's future position as the last remaining English-speaking country in the EU.  We are encouraging an \"Ireland first\" determination to exploit the opportunities arising from Brexit that are best suited to our economy and our workforce.<\/p> <p>  We are asking the committee, especially on behalf of small businesses, to bear in mind when it asks us questions about the impact of Brexit on small businesses that a certain amount of this is unknown.  Many of our member companies and small businesses are transacting business with larger businesses.  The committee will hear from representatives of larger businesses later in this meeting.  We do not yet know what the extent of their exposure will be in areas like forestry, tourism and business and agriculture supplies.  We participated in the all-Ireland dialogue last week.  We believe that forum was successful in identifying most of the streams of work that are necessary to plot a detailed Brexit strategy for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We ask this committee to encourage the Government to take a more streamlined approach to the planning and management of the Brexit issue.  This should be based along departmental lines and should start with the Departments that are most affected.  I refer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which this committee marks, and also to the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If this does not happen, trade associations like ISME and the businesses we represent will simply end up regurgitating the same information in duplicate to many Departments and committees.  We would like the Government to spare us that fate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonnell.

I would like to refer briefly to four issues.  First, I will share some of the statistics we have.  We have done a number of surveys.  We did one before the vote and we closed another one a couple of weeks after the vote.  We are about to go out with another one in a week or so.  Second, I will speak about the anecdotal evidence we are picking up.  The comments of the previous speakers have confirmed much of what we are hearing anecdotally.  Third, I will set out what we are recommending.  Fourth, I will discuss an initiative for action we are pursuing.  I think it might address certain issues.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on some of the headline statistics in our presentation.  Some 92% of our members are saying that Brexit will have a harmful effect on Irish exporters.  Some of 89% of our members are doing business with the UK.  Some 82% of those who are exporting to the UK are doing business in England.  I remind the committee that these results go back a couple of months.  When we asked our members whether they were planning to decrease or increase their level of trade with the UK over the following six months, 31% of them said they were planning to increase it.  Those results might be a little different when we undertake another survey in the coming weeks.  We also found that the weakened value of sterling has had an impact on 65% of the businesses surveyed.<\/p> <p>  When we did this survey in March - I think that was the first time we did it - we found that 68% of our members were pretty much unhedged at that stage.  That figure dropped to 49% within two weeks of the vote.  When we spoke to many of the banks the morning after the vote, they told us that much of the coverage was out until the first quarter of next year.  The committee needs to be aware that a lot of cover on sterling comes off in the first three months of 2017 and, as a result, we will probably head into a perfect storm at that time.  Our members' single biggest concern is currency instability.  They are also worried about the introduction of Border controls, the impact on economic growth, customs procedures, dual regulation and the reintroduction of tariffs.  It is not just the tariffs that would affect the physical trade but it is also the time delay and the need for companies to employ people with the skills to fill out the paperwork.  Someone mentioned to me that the return of borders would increase the cost of doing business by 14%.  I should mention in that context that our organisation does not believe the British Government's view on immigration is reconcilable with the existence of a soft Border with Northern Ireland.  We believe those two positions are irreconcilable at the moment.<\/p> <p>  When we asked our members whether they were planning to invest more in Ireland, 19% of them said they would increase their investment in Ireland and 11% of them said they would decrease such investment.<\/p><p>On whether companies plan to increase or decrease employment, the split is even.  On the level of pain experienced because of fluctuations in the currency exchange rate, it is the big issue for companies, but in the longer term the big issue will be competitiveness.  The first point at which there is pain for a lot of companies is 85 pence sterling, with 90 pence being the next point.  As we are now in that zone, the point of pain is a big issue.  We have completed an exercise, a copy of which is included in the presentation, on the correlation of movements in the exchange rate with exports to the United Kingdom.  They are correlated with each other.  Exports to the United Kingdom dropped during the first eight months of the year.  <\/p><p> We asked companies if they were planning to consider different markets as a result of the vote.  In response 54% replied \"Yes\".  The main markets they are considering are the USA, Germany and France.  There is a lot of talk about and interest in the German and US markets.  We need to be cognisant of the fact that it is a lot easier to do business in the United Kingdom than it is in any other country in the world.  That is why so many of our exports are to the United Kingdom.  Anecdotally, what we are hearing is that the immediate impact has been on the exchange rate, with which, as I said, companies are currently struggling.  <\/p><p> Companies are also examining their sources of supply.  If they find they can purchase raw material cheaper in the United Kingdom than here, they are switching their source of supply.  <\/p><p> The next piece is sub-supply.  I think this is going to have a huge effect in rural Ireland.  We have visited companies around the country and know, for example, that there are a number of businesses with a couple of hundred jobs that are using widgets made by a company down the road that maybe has ten or 20 jobs.  These businesses can now can have the widgets made cheaper in the United Kingdom.  This will impact considerably on local SMEs.  It is not only those who are exporting but the entire supply chain that is being affected.<\/p><p> Earlier one of the IBEC representatives spoke about Irish companies examining whether they might shift some of their production or services to the United Kingdom.  That is an issue on which we have also been picking up since February.  There is a more positive tax system in the United Kingdom where it is cheaper to find employees.  The support the British Government provides in unemployment black spots and so on is generous.  <\/p><p> Without going into our recommendations in detail, the immediate recommendation concerns what can be done in dealing with currency and cash flow lending issues.  Reference was made to a fund that was available in 2008-09.  If it is reintroduced, we will need to ensure funds will be available to all Irish businesses, not just companies supported by the Irish agencies.  That is a big issue, as is cash flow lending.  In our pre-budget submission we called for a national hedging plan.  We have since been told that it would breach state aid rules, but it might be an easier way to try to help companies.  We felt the NTMA could manage the risk and that the SBCI and the national banks could farm out the money.<\/p><p> The next piece is much more detailed and deals with cost competitiveness issues and others relevant to the National Competitiveness Council and whether we are living up to our potential in this regard.  The longer term picture involves how competitive we will be with other countries.  On Brexit, there is no magic bullet.  It has been suggested we seek to export to markets in Japan, China and other places and although it will be more difficult to export to these markets than the United Kingdom, we need to start to build a long-term ability.  <\/p><p> How we spend our resources overseas is another issue that needs to be examined.  It is quite expensive to send public servants overseas in terms of housing provision and educating children.  Working with local partners is another way to go.  There are organisations in China which will give companies and governments greater access to local expertise.  That needs to be done.  We have in place a public-private initiative known as the national export hub, in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, InterTradeIreland and some local enterprise offices are involved.  On the commercial side, companies such as ABP, AIB, DHL and PwC are involved.  Two years ago, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, we travelled all around the country and engaged with approximately 800 people on the issue of export competence.  We have since taught 20 companies how to export.  The difference between what we are doing and what other State-run organisations are doing is that the training we provide is delivered by the commercial partners involved.  Rather than have a consultant speak to companies about how they should go about borrowing money, AIB is engaging with them on what they need to do if they need to borrow money.  DHL is teaching them about logistics.  It is a live initiative which, as I said, includes some Government involvement and support from commercial partners.  We could do a lot more with it if it was funded because we use the funding available to employ people to help companies.  Through the national export hub and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade we are connecting companies with, say, ambassadors overseas.  We are connecting companies through our network all over the world and helping them to grow.  I wanted to ensure everybody was aware of this initiative.  As I said, there is Government involvement, although to a limited extent, but it is an initiative on which we could build.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeever.

We have been engaging a great deal with Departments, particularly the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance, to find practical, short-term solutions to the problems arising from Brexit.  There are many people with good will who are acting to deal with them.  What we need is a cohesive national strategy in order that we all know who to whom we should talk.<\/p> <p>  There are 238,000 businesses in Ireland, of which 98% are small in that they employ fewer than 50 people.  In more than 21 counties they employ more than 50% of the workforce.  It is important that in this analysis we also look at their needs.  We need to realise that the agencies have for many years been working to try to increase exports, but the figure for total exports still amounts to only 6.4%.  While there has been a massive effort made to diversify beyond the United Kingdom, this has not yet been achieved.  We need to be realistic about where we were before Brexit in trying to get companies to internationalise.  That is difficult and tough to do; therefore, we need to look at the issue in the context of the removal of Ireland from the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  Like many organisations, we also engaged in an analysis after the vote which indicated that the main issues of concern were exchange rate movements, which have since come to pass, the cost of exporting and pricing.  Small companies do not tend to have sophisticated instruments such that when we asked our members about hedging, 85% stated they had no hedging mechanisms in place, while 87% stated they had no pricing agreements in place.  Even though they are the suppliers, in terms of the relationship between them, it is very much the case that the companies to which they are selling are dictating the terms of sale and payment.  That is an issue for consideration.  Some companies did identify positives.  While recent discussions have been very much focused on the negatives, we need a separate strategy for how we can use exchange rate movements in our favour, how we can win in-bound investment projects and the better pricing relationships we might be able to negotiate in certain sectors.  <\/p> <p>  We are all here as business bodies which represent their members.  There is huge disengagement and an air of unreality in the business community.  People still do not have contingency plans in place.  Most think this is not going to affect them.  The message we need to get out is that it is not only exporters but also the sub-supply chain, the retail sector, the tourism industry and so on that will be affected.  We need a plan for all of these sectors.  The companies that do not know that they are going to be impacted on are probably the most vulnerable.  At least, exporters are trying to put a plan in place.  We need to take an holistic view.  There are a number of priority and other actions that should be taken in the short, medium and longer term, bearing in mind the fact that in most businesses the margins are pretty tight, particularly in small firms.<\/p><p>Sterling has devalued 18% since the date of the vote but 28% since last December.  I do not know anyone in business who makes more than 30% and, therefore, everybody in this market is loss making at this point and it is a question of how long they can hang in there.  I have included one e-mail from a member in the submission, which will give the committee a flavour of what his company is trying to do.  It is a food company in the midlands which employs just under 50 people.  It has had to let go &euro;2.7 million in revenue.  It cannot afford to service existing contracts because they are so loss making.  It is not just about the raw agricultural products market; prepared consumer foods are low margin businesses.  We have had huge success in this market but with most of those products, it is not a question of being able to go to France or Germany.  Irish and British tastes are the same; we consume the same types of food.  Those foods are not eaten on the Continent and, therefore, there is no market for them.  If we want to have a food sector in two years, we have to act now.  When Brexit happens, we will secure many competitive advantages but if we have not kept this sector going for the intervening two years, companies will not be around to compete with British imports in two years.<\/p><p> That means we need to push hard on state aid rules.  Every time we talk to Government officials, we are told we cannot do that repeatedly.  It is time to reframe this into what can we do.  We have to take this to the EU and make the case that this is an exceptional time and Brexit will have an exceptional impact on our country.  The temporary state aid rules which they were well able to introduce in 2009 during the financial crisis should be invoked once more.  We should be allowed to use those and develop schemes such as the enterprise stabilisation fund.  State aid takes time.  Even if we were to get a scheme through, it would take six to 12 months.  In practical terms, we are realistic in the short term and we need to focus more on innovative financing measures because they are not subject to the same rules.  Some companies will simply need cash to help them while financing instruments will help others but all the options need to be considered now.  Whenever a decision is taken, there will be a long chain to get it through.<\/p><p> With regard to low cost financing measures, the budget provides for a scheme in the agriculture sector.  That is attractive and I understand from the SBCI that it will have products in the market by January.  We need to examine that as a model to see whether such low cost loans could be made available to small companies.  We have had ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance for the best part of four years about export credit insurance.  We have conducted surveys for officials and they have all this analysis.  They are meant to bring forward an export finance product and we would like to see that.  If we have done all this work, let us get those products go to market and have a sense of urgency.<\/p><p> It is important to realise that this is not just about exports.  Our supermarkets are hard to deal with as a supplier.  They will replace Irish products with cheap UK imports and, therefore, a national public awareness campaign needs to be run about the impact of that choice and about the fact that consumers choosing to buy those cheaper products will kill off the food sector at the same time.  Much of the time, this is a public consciousness issue about raising awareness and that needs to be done in the lead-up to Christmas.  Cross-Border shopping is a particular issue but this will be seen in every shop.<\/p><p> Similarly, we have had on ongoing discussion about why more companies are not trading online.  It will be a &euro;20 billion market in the next five years and most small companies do not have an online presence and do not have the capacity to take orders online.  The online trading voucher scheme is a successful model but that is restricted to micro companies with fewer than ten employees.  Most retailers have more employees than that.  Measures we know will succeed in the short term need to be ramped up to give people a broader reach in terms of their marketplace.<\/p><p> The top issue for our members immediately after the decision for the short, medium and long term was the freedom of movement of people and that border aspect will be critical.  Colleagues have referred to the renewed cost focus in terms of cost competitiveness and the tax competitiveness issue versus the UK.  When the UK leaves the EU, it clearly will not have state aid or be subject to public procurement directives and it will be out there to compete with us.  We need to be conscious of that as well as the opportunities open to us from being within the EU market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for their presentations.

I did an interview for a food magazine in the UK and I was talking about our price competitiveness position in the UK, but they are worried that the UK supermarkets will eventually have to put up prices and they will have no choice but to do that.  They are all talking about the end of January and February as the time when the renegotiations may happen.  The Unilever effect may force more suppliers to talk to the supermarkets in the UK.

We have some members who have, for example, purchased companies in the UK in order that they can move stuff across and match up their costs and revenues.  Of course, that is what they will do.  They face a serious hedging problem.  The main problem is if a company's revenue is down significantly because of currency, either that is replaced or costs are reduced or a combination of both is used.  One of the obvious questions is what should be done.  On the cost side, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, produces three key reports every year.  In the first instance, we should apply the same rules as the Action Plan for Jobs process, which is that when a report of significance is produced, there should be responsibilities, timelines and actions to implement its recommendations.  If currency goes the wrong way by 24%, a business has to reduce costs in the medium run.  In the short run, clearly currency and working capital supports have to be provided.  The bottom line in the food sector, for example, is if companies are to continue to do business in the UK, their cost base will have to reduced by at least 15%.  We have NCC reports talking about that year after year but nothing is done about it.  Now is the time we have to do something about this, take it seriously and apply some rigour to the process.  There are two issues - the currency and the export credits on the revenue side and the NCC issues on the cost side.<\/p><p> There is a third issue that the committee could consider.  It has been a very long time since we have had a Culleton or Telesis report.  We need to have a strategic review of Irish industrial policy from top to bottom.  IDA Ireland is advocating foreign direct investment, which is great, and Enterprise Ireland is advocating for exporters, which is also great.  Enterprise Ireland also looks after the micro-enterprises.  The vast majority of employment in this country, however, is not represented by anybody.  I am sorry to have to say that but it is the truth.  There is no advocate within Government.  There is no agency but there should be.  I would be saying very strongly that we need to start thinking about those who create most of the jobs in this country and help them to get better and stronger and to start thinking about exporting and other activities.  That is another issue.<\/p><p> The term of the Action Plan for Jobs normally finishes at this time of the year.  It may be finished already.  Perhaps we need to review it and Brexit-proof it.  I am not sure whether that has been done.  There is a lot of work to do and we need to get ourselves organised very quickly.  Quarter 1 of next year is when a lot of stuff will begin to fall off the back of the truck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Coghlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I appreciate the stark message and warnings the delegates have provided.  Some chilling words have been said.  Some of our producers and exporters are not aware of the problems they will face down the line.  As Mr. McKeever said, if products can be bought more cheaply in England, the guy down the road, the small business, will be really hurt.  Many of these people do not see the problem staring them in the face.<\/p> <p>  We are trying to solve this problem and determine how we can cope with it.  We are examining costs and talking about the co-location of businesses, action plans, training and other measures we have heard about today.  However, the real elephant in the room is the currency.  I am curious to learn from all those who operate at the coalface whether they or their organisations would contemplate staying in the European Union but reverting to a punt, with some possible link to sterling or the euro?  I refer to some type of floating punt currency.  We may be trying to solve everything else instead of tackling the real problem.  This problem will not go away.  If we stay within eurozone, which I presume we will be doing in the short term, and if we deal in euro, we will have to contend with the value of sterling going up and down.  The UK is the market to which we export most.  Perhaps we should go back to basics or to where we were before the euro.  Perhaps we should consider a floating currency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#T00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Who would like to reply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I have not been working with currencies for a number of years.  The question of whether we should have a floating currency linked to sterling has come out of left field.  I will answer in a slightly different way from that which might be expected.  The extreme volatility we are currently seeing in the currency market is likely to continue.  Right now, much of the bad news we have heard is probably priced into it but we do not know what will happen in the next few months.  I am not sure whether I advocate a floating punt because, as a country, we have very small reserves by comparison with the European Central Bank.  In answering, I am thinking completely left field also.  We could find ourselves in circumstances in which the punt could become extremely devalued if the economy were to come under attack.  From an exporter's point of view, it might be a good idea.  From an importer's point of view, it would not be good.<\/p> <p>  Could I expand a little on the currency piece?  I mentioned that we came up with a national hedging strategy.  I had seen something like it done in another country approximately 20 years ago.  The export credit insurance risk of the country, as a national phenomenon, was managed by a particular entity using synthetic options.  One could have a vehicle in the NTMA, perhaps, that knows how to manage the risk.  Rather than pouring &euro;200 million, &euro;300 million, &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million into an enterprise development fund, could it be poured in to manage a set of options such as those I describe?  Somebody needs to pick up the telephone because there has to be a different approach with Brussels at present if there is to be a breach of state-aid rules.  It is possible that a hedging strategy could be put in place at national level and that a reduced or subsidised rate could be given, particularly to smaller businesses.<\/p> <p>  On hedging, we have all mentioned different kinds of statistics.  Our figure for what is on hedge is approximately 50% but we have range of companies in it, from small to very large.  It is done in a very peculiar way in this country in that a company, unless it is very sophisticated, is relying on its bank.  When I worked in the banks, foreign exchange procedures were such that when amounts of sterling came into one's hold account, the trader rang and said it was in and asked whether one wanted to trade on that day.  One checked the rate and if it was not favourable, one decided to wait and wait and wait.  The professionalism associated with understanding currency risk does not exist in smaller businesses, so we need to have an action plan on that.  In small businesses, the trusted adviser is the accountant.  Smaller accountants, in particular, do not understand that the management of the risk needs to be built strategically into one's business management.  Therefore, it is not about the rate of next week or month.  We are all talking about the first quarter next year.  It is a question of determining the risk associated with the currency being valued at X, Y or Z next March, April or May and what one should do about it.  Unfortunately, the organisations that know about this stuff, namely, the banks, do not command trust.  I have stood up publicly in a chartered accountant's house and asked whether they could develop a continuous professional development programme to help smaller accountants and businesses to understand the exchange rate movement.  I am sorry I did not answer the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>A sensible honest answer to that question is that it depends.  I am an old enough to remember the exchange rate mechanism crisis and what happened to mortgages in the country at that time.  Do members recall that crisis?  A major consideration for an export company is whether the balance of its trade is in the eurozone, sterling zone or elsewhere.  There are countries in Europe, such as Denmark, that have their own currencies.  Effectively, it ends up being a euro surrogate.  They are managing it a little bit.  It sounds like I am trying to avoid answering the question but I believe that we should at least have a contingency plan.  The committee will have heard much talk about what could happen to Italy, for example.  If the euro is to go through another huge crisis and sterling actually starts to look attractive again as a reserve currency, would it not be great to have a contingency plan for circumstances in which we had to opt for the punt mark II?  Would it not be great to know that we had printing presses identified that would be able to run off the currency quickly?  Would it not be great to know that we had somewhere to store it?  A few hundred tonnes of the currency would do.  We have the place to store it.

There was a lot of food for thought - pardon the pun.  I am acutely aware of some of the issues the delegates have raised, particularly in respect of food producers.  Even some of the bigger ones, with perhaps 300 people working for them, have a major fear of cheap imported products.  North County Dublin has approximately 35 to 40 farmers or horticulturists who produce approximately 65% of the vegetables in the country.  They are always at loggerheads with the retailers.  They fear a time when the 40-footers will start coming in with the cheap produce and put them out of business.  In five years, when the 40-footers stop coming, perhaps, the skill set will be lost.  That is a real concern.  Some suggestions have been made on what the Government might look to.  Clearly, there is a great deal of work to be done in trying to achieve what has been described and keep within state-aid rules.  Obviously, the Taoiseach has already made it very clear that he has presented Ireland's case as a very special one, particularly in light of the Border, the peace process and our exports to and relationship with the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Callan.

A very interesting point was raised about possibly looking at more innovative forms of financing and getting away from thinking about hedging.  For example, something like invoice discounting where one actually gets paid in real time is a hedge in and of itself.  By moving or shifting one's logic away from normal overdrafts and term loans into alternative financing methods, there could be a natural hedge and it might give those sorts of products a lift.

Staff cuts in the pats five years have been in the region of 20%.  I have spoken to people at a high level within that organisation who have told me that they are very concerned about a knowledge loss that has occurred.

In terms of our focus and approach to these things, the Department tends to view them through the lens of the agencies.  What we are really trying to say is that there is a much bigger cohort of businesses out there that we need to look at if we are designing supports.  We certainly need expertise, knowledge and practical assistance on the ground.

We could be more creative in not just relying on our agencies but figuring out how we could engage those people better to work on our behalf and create joint business propositions in their countries.  That might be an option also.<\/p><p> In terms of the comments about the joint labour committees, JLCs, it is part of my submission around cost competitiveness.  Going back to the point about eight years of recession, my biggest concern when the recession hit was that there was a lot of fat, so to speak.  Businesses were able to cut costs.  They renegotiated their energy costs, input costs and so on.  The point about smaller companies is that they are price takers, and labour costs ended up being one of the few areas under people's control so what did we see?  We saw people lose their jobs, redundancies and people put on short time because wages were simply uncompetitive.  As we got into the recession we saw that industries that had the flexibility negotiated voluntary decreases to allow people stay in their jobs.  We need that level of flexibility.  The problem with measures like the joint labour committees, which is my fundamental question, is that they existed when we had no labour law.  We now have 40 labour law measures and whether someone employs one or 4,000 people, they still need to know them all.  Equally, we have a National Minimum Wage Act.  If we have a national minimum wage across the board, why do we need these additional agreements on top of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>So that people will get paid more than the minimum wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#V00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Yes, but in contract cleaning that cost is simply passed back on the users of that service.

I was not aware that was in the Small Firms Association, SFA, submission but I am glad he raised it.  I will give the Senator an example of the difficulty it presents, and this is what is called the issue of cost transmission.  The recent arrangement on contract cleaning lifts the minimum wage in that sector and gives a planned series of rises over &euro;10.  The interesting aspect is that it does not apply to workers in the hotel sector.  In terms of what will happen, therefore, small contract cleaning businesses employing cleaners in hotels will lose those businesses to hotels which will employ people on a generic contract where they will do that work at minimum wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#V01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1478622600,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I could not agree more.

I am trying to be helpful in terms of the position the Senator represents to his membership, and I know he has a difficult furrow to plough from time to time.  Very good research was done this summer in University of Washington, Washington state, where there was a substantial increase in the minimum wage from $9.50 to around $11.  When they analysed the effect of what actually happened - this is what is called cost transmission - the ability of certain businesses to recover that hourly increase did not exist.  While the hourly rate increased, the total amount those workers got fell.  What the Senator would call P60 earnings dropped because those businesses had to maintain the total cost of manpower.  That is what happened.  Unfortunately, that is what happens in the real world.  I regret to say we will see more of that, especially if the United Kingdom, about which we are very concerned, gets hyper-competitive in that area.  That is a real concern.  We are afraid that what is happening on the minimum wage and the so-called living wage front will put more people on social supports rather than in employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#V01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I call Mr. McKeever to conclude and ask him to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016110800002#V01700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478622600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Briefly, there were two questions on Enterprise Ireland, EI, and our national export hub.  In terms of whether Enterprise Ireland have more resources, there are two sides to that.  We need more resources in our external facing piece.  There are already a number of resources there.  We are not very well co-ordinated across our embassies.  In terms of the EI people, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia, that starts with a collective approach here in Ireland where there may be a governing board sitting over all of those agencies.  There are more resources and by putting them together we would get more out of them.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Callan said, EI does not cover every company in the country.  One of the reasons the Irish Exporters Association exists is because we provide them with a good deal of support.  Do they need more resources?  They could get the skill set right.  Another question is whether they need expensive internal resources or could that be farmed out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our national export hub, we would welcome further discussion on that.  We use the funding to employ people to be able to help small businesses in the main.  It is our small business proposition.  Next year, we will have two very large events in different parts of the country and we will then start working with companies in a very hands-on fashion to teach them how to export.  Enterprise Ireland has chosen not to be involved in that programme with us but the Department of Foreign Affairs is involved in it with us.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, come in and out of it.  In fact, we are developing a piece for the LEOs and we will be launching something with them.
