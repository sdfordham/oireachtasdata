The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015 provides statutory recognition of the 'national transition objective' &ndash; the goal of pursuing a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. \u00a0In order to facilitate the achievement of this objective, the 2015 Act provides for the development and submission to Government of national mitigation plans and adaptation frameworks which must\u00a0take account of, inter alia, the need to promote sustainable development in performing functions related to these measures.<\/p>  <p>  I intend shortly to initiate a public consultation on a new Clean Air Strategy for Ireland.  The initiatives on climate action and air quality are key steps in progressing national policy in support of transition to a low-carbon, competitive and environmentally sustainable future.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030, sets out a long-term vision to guide Irish energy policy and actions to be taken in the energy sector from now until 2030, in order to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce our fossil fuel dependency.  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place to accelerate the development and diversification of renewable energy in Ireland including the REFIT schemes which underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies.  Two new renewables support schemes are also under development including\u00a0a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) aimed at increasing renewables in the heat sector and a Renewable Electricity Support Scheme aimed at providing support for renewable electricity.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning waste, my Department is actively engaged in the on-going discussions on the EU action plan on the circular economy.\u00a0 The circular economy aims to replace the &lsquo;take-make-dispose&rsquo; model of production with a more sustainable one that champions recycling and renewables, the reduction of emissions and waste, minimum extraction of virgin raw materials and the reuse of valuable components and materials.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Our Sustainable Future &ndash; the Framework for Sustainable Development in Ireland, which was launched in June 2012, identifies some 70 measures to be implemented across Government and tasks a high-level inter-departmental group with ensuring that the vision set out in the policy document is translated into clear and effective action.  The report on implementation of the framework published last year described how Ireland continues to move in the right direction generally across the spectrum of sustainable development goals.\u00a0 As economic activity increases, maintaining the focus on sustainability in parallel with economic recovery and growth will be critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC00400"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[38628\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to safeguard existing fixed wireless broadband networks in view of the ongoing tendering for the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>In October, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to auction spectrum in the 3.6GHz band (Wireless telegraphy (3.6GHz Band Licences) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.\u00a0 532 of 2016)). \u00a0The\u00a0liberalisation of this band is an EU\u00a0requirement and the\u00a0release of spectrum in this band will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and\/or fixed wireless services, leading to\u00a0better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in the process for allocating the spectrum which is now underway.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.\u00a0 The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published\u00a0projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to\u00a0have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).<\/p>  <p>  According to the latest GHG inventory published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in November 2016, emissions for 2015 are estimated at 59.84 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq),\u00a0which\u00a0is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015, which was enacted in December 2015.\u00a0 The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.\u00a0 Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the\u00a0Act.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to launch an initial\u00a0non-statutory public consultation process\u00a0shortly\u00a0to inform preparation of a draft National Mitigation Plan.  This draft Plan\u00a0will then be subject to a further statutory consultation, followed by submission of a final plan\u00a0to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce GHG emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.\u00a0 The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond this date and out to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the efforts outlined above to address the challenge to comply with the 2020 targets, in the likely event that a gap to target still exists in 2020, retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 can be offset against the deficit.  If this\u00a0does not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase\u00a0 notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.  Should the need to purchase carbon units arise, funding options\u00a0will be considered\u00a0in due course and will have regard to a number of matters, including the need to comply with the fiscal rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[38630\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to encourage the development of the electric vehicle fleet and electric vehicle charge points here.","asker":"1294","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets all Member States a binding target that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector must come from renewable sources by 2020.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial\u00a0investment by the telecommunications sector\u00a0and through\u00a0a State intervention in those\u00a0areas where commercial investment has\u00a0not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area, comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one that will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.<\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services Provision","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[38572\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of times the mobile phone and broadband task force has met; the action points that have been acted on from these meetings; the number of phone companies he has met since the task force was established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1276","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile phone and broadband networks are not always delivering the services people expect.\u00a0 Telecoms operators have however rolled out high speed broadband services to approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland over the last number of years, and\u00a0mobile operators have\u00a0 invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.

This framework has, in my\u00a0view served consumers well over several decades and ensured that householders can get an affordable fixed voice service, regardless of where they are located.<\/p>  <p>  Currently there are no universal service obligations (USO)\u00a0for high speed broadband provision in Ireland and the European Telecommunications Framework does not facilitate the imposition of a high speed broadband USO.  The National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to every premises in the country, through a State intervention in areas where such networks are not available.  The winning bidder(s) in the procurement process will be required to build out a wholesale, open access, high speed broadband network.  Under a 25 year contract with the Department, they will be required to connect any premises within the Intervention area that requires a high speed connection.<\/p>  <p>  Thus National Broadband Plan will deliver the network which will be required, to connect all premises.  While USO alone could not be expected to deliver new high speed broadband networks of this scale, I am of the view that where high speed broadband networks are available, USO could provide a very useful tool to ensure that all premises within a network area can get a connection.  This is particularly relevant in cities and towns, where commercial operators have already deployed high speed networks, but for technical or other reasons, some premises still may not be able to obtain services.<\/p>  <p>  I am in discussion with ComReg as to whether a universal service obligation (USO) may be a viable instrument in such instances, i.e. in areas where a high speed network is available but individual premises cannot access such services at an affordable price.  This is similar to the arrangements which are already in place for fixed voice.<\/p>  <p>  I have also raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level.\u00a0 In September, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have asked the Commission to consider a specific provision in the new framework that will allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.<\/p>  <p>  There are no provisions in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services.  Mobile operators are however rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce is considering issues which will facilitate better delivery of mobile voice and data services.  In October, I signed regulations which will allow ComReg to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.<\/p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.\u00a0 ComReg in turn will make plans to auction this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to discuss with ComReg, how the allocation of spectrum in the 700MHz band could facilitate greater penetration of mobile voice and data services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[38614\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600058#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his Department's definition of carbon neutrality and sustainable food production, in view of the fact that these terms are often used in tandem with each other with regard to Ireland's climate change mitigation obligations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The EU and wider international position on carbon neutrality is not well developed and lacks clarity\u00a0of definition at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the process of defining carbon neutrality from an Irish agriculture and land use perspective, a number of scenarios are being considered and the definition ultimately approved will have to be robust on scientific, technical and environmental grounds, and compatible with present and anticipated future requirements under EU and International law.<\/p>  <p>  This issue was examined by NESC in its 2012\u00a0report, \"Ireland and the climate change challenge: connecting \"How Much\" with \"How To\"\".

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to \u00a0commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the \u00a0remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,00 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. <\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.

The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect to publish the report of the Taskforce \u00a0in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed in early 2017 to allocate spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.

It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up\u00a0in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to\u00a0allow ESB to enter the\u00a0telecoms market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.4m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 400,000 more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated.\u00a0Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012.\u00a0At least two operators\u00a0have announced ambitious\u00a0fibre-to-the-home roll-out plans, one\u00a0of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy.<\/p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project. Since then, my predecessor and I have held media briefings to flag key milestones in the development of the Plan. These include: <\/p><p>-  November 2014 - the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map and launch of a public consultation.<\/p><p><font color=\"#1F497D\">  -  <\/font>June 2015 - the publication of the draft Intervention Strategy along with 7 expert reports which are supporting the delivery of the procurement.<\/p><p>-  December 2015 - the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and formal launch of the procurement process, with the publication of a detailed Project Information Memorandum and Project Information Notice in the Official Journal of the EU. <\/p><p>-  July 2016 - the decision by Government in relation to the ownership model for the\u00a0network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies to be brought forward as bidders in the procurement process. <\/p><p>-  July 2016- the\u00a0establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that\u00a0regular progress reports on the development of the plan, at the key milestone stages outlined, is important in order to inform the public of progress.<\/p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll<font color=\"#1F497D\">-<\/font>out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and \/ or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

The Garda National Drugs Unit works closely with dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units and other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am informed that so far 24 of these probationer Garda have been assigned to the Waterford Division. It is expected that drug law enforcement  activities and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.<\/p><p>The following table gives a breakdown of the number of Garda members assigned to the Waterford Divisional Drugs Unit in each of the years 2008 to  2016 as of 31 October 2016.  I have requested details of the number of Garda assigned to the Waterford Divisional Drugs Unit for the years 2006 and 2007 from the Commissioner and I will write directly to the Deputy when this information is to hand.<div><table><tr><th colspan=\"2\"><div>Waterford Divisional Drugs Unit<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Year<\/div><\/td><td><div>Strength<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2013<\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2014<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2015<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2016<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Retirements","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[38536\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans regarding raising and or abolishing the mandatory retirement age; and if there are plans underway to progress the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014.","asker":"1243","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>In my role in the Department of Justice and Equality, I have responsibility for equality legislation, which provides for retirement ages in line with the relevant EU Directive provision that differences of treatment on the grounds of age are permissible if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I have no Ministerial responsibility for retirement age issues generally either in the public sector (where mandatory retirement ages are a feature of public sector employment law) or the private sector (where there is no statutory retirement age).<\/p>  <p>  The Bill to which the Deputy refers was a Private Members' Bill and I am not aware of any plans to advance it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Procedures","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[38548\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the advice that can be given to a person (details supplied) looking for information on a High Court case that was taken against that person's company by the Central Bank in 1999 and 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a litigant cannot be represented before the courts by a lay person.

Details of solicitors who hold a current practising certificate\u00a0and professional indemnity insurance in Meath are available on the Society's website www.lawsociety.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I presume that when the Deputy refers to &ldquo;a voucher for a legal board office solicitor&rdquo; he is referring to a voucher for free legal advice issued under the Abhaile scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, in October 2016, I launched Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. An important component of this scheme is that free legal advice is available to insolvent borrowers who are in danger of losing their family home.  The free legal advice scheme operates on the basis that persons make applications to their local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) office to avail of the Scheme. There are no means or merits criteria applicable although a person must meet three criteria for admission to the scheme:<\/p>  <p>  The person is insolvent (as defined under s. 2 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012: i.e. the borrower is &lsquo;unable to pay his or her debts in full as they fall due&rsquo;), and <\/p>  <p>  The person is in mortgage arrears on the home in which they ordinarily reside (their &lsquo;principal private residence&rsquo; (PPR)  as defined by s. 2 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012), and<\/p>  <p>  The person is at risk of losing that home (i.e. they have received from the mortgage lender repossession proceedings, a letter indicating that such proceedings will issue, a letter indicating that they are deemed non-cooperating, or an invitation to consider sale, surrender or other loss of all or part of the home).<\/p>  <p>  If a person is admitted to the scheme, they will be given free financial advice either from the MABS office, a MABS dedicated mortgage arrears advisor, a PIP, or an accountant. If the MABS office or their financial advisor identifies that they would also benefit from free legal advice, they are given a voucher and a list of solicitors who have agreed to provide free legal advice under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  If a person who has been issued a legal advice voucher is having difficulty identifying a solicitor or redeeming a voucher they should contact the Legal Aid Board. It is important to note that while the Legal Aid Board administers this free legal advice service, the solicitors who provide services under this scheme are private practitioners and do not work in Legal Aid Board offices (law centres). <\/p>  <p>  The scheme covers legal advice but does not extend to legal aid in the sense of representation in court.  However, a duty solicitor service at county registrars&rsquo; courts is available as part of the Abhaile scheme.  The duty solicitor cannot come on record for the borrower nor may they draft the court documents needed to defend repossession proceedings. The duty solicitor may speak on behalf of the borrower but the applications they can make are limited to seeking an adjournment so that the borrower can either apply to a Legal Aid Board law centre for civil legal aid or obtain representation privately.  <\/p>  <p>  If such a person applies for services to a Legal Aid Board law centre in connection with the defence of repossession proceedings, the application will be considered under the normal criteria that apply under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Missing Persons Data","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[38694\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the details of all missing persons from the State and the dates of their disappearances in tabular form;

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural - has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

To build on this early success I was pleased to announce last week that I am sending our fourth mission to Lebanon to arrange for a further 260 refugees to come to Ireland. This is in addition to an earlier commitment of 260 refugees due to arrive in the first half of 2017. The total additional commitment of a further 520 refugees in 2017 in effect doubles our original commitment to resettle refugees under this two year programme. <\/p>  <p>  This latest decision reflects the Government's commitment to welcome vulnerable refugees fleeing war and conflict and is another positive step towards meeting our overall commitment to accept 4,000 persons.  It also takes account of the slower than anticipated arrival of asylum seekers from Greece and Italy as a result of operational difficulties experienced by all countries in the initial establishment of the Relocation strand of the IRPP in those countries. However, following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve. Ireland has provided the Greek authorities with a full timetable for the acceptance, by end September 2017, of the entire cohort of asylum seekers allocated to Ireland under the relevant Council Decisions. Ireland has to date accepted 131 persons under the relocation strand. A further 127 persons are scheduled to arrive later this month with regular substantial monthly arrivals from Greece thereafter. The Greek programme is now working very well and Ireland expects to meet its full obligations to Greece. <\/p>  <p>  The relocation of asylum seekers from Italy to Ireland has been hampered by technical issues which have been the subject of discussion up to ministerial level. It is hoped that the issues can be resolved in the near future which will allow the numbers being taken in under the IRPP to increase further.<\/p>  <p>  An All Party D&aacute;il motion approved by Government on 10 November last called on the Government to work with the French authorities to identify up to 200 unaccompanied minors previously living in the unofficial migrant camp in Calais and who have expressed a desire to relocate to Ireland.  My Department is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on all matters arising from the commitments agreed in the recent D&aacute;il motion. Both the French and British authorities and relevant NGOs have been contacted and information is awaited from NGOs in respect of children identified as wishing to relocate to Ireland. It is essential, if Ireland is identified as a location of choice for these young people, that services are in place and can cope with any such arrivals. We must ensure that we maintain the highest standards of international protection and care. The legal pathway for entry must also be robust to ensure that our actions fully comply with international best practice and protection law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Status","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[38816\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600060#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on amending legislation to restore citizenship by birth here without reference to a person's parents' status; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of victims.

This process is ongoing. AIB s review has found the bank fell short on its\u00a0 obligations to some customers.  In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.  Approximately 50% of the impacted customers are EBS and the remainder AIB.  You will note that AIB s CEO Bernard Byrne recently told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach that, based on an assessment of the work done to date, 14 customers may have lost their homes as a result of having the incorrect rate applied to their mortgage accounts.  AIB is contacting these customers to agree appropriate compensation measures.  The process involved an examination of tens of thousands of accounts and is being conducted in accordance with Central Bank of Ireland guidelines.  As the review progresses, AIB is commencing refunds to customers who overpaid interest and is paying compensation.  Details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will establish an independent\u00a0appeals process.  An independent third party, KPMG, is reviewing key aspects of AIB s work.  The overall review will take some time to complete.  AIB has put in place a customer Freephone Helpline 1800 235 460 (Mon-Fri, 8:00am-7:00pm) to assist with any queries its customers may have.&quot;<\/p><p><b>PTSB<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;On 28 July 2015, Permanent TSB Group announced details of its Mortgage Redress Programme (MRP).  The MRP was established to address failures by Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages Limited (a Group subsidiary) in respect of 1,372 Tracker mortgage accounts.  The Group determined that of this population, had the Group s failure not occurred, 22 customers (all Permanent TSB accounts) may have avoided losing ownership of their property.  In making this determination, the Bank considered all relevant information available to it, including information relating to the customers affordability as set out by them in any completed Standard Financial Statements, the repayments that the customer was making to their mortgage at the time, the repayment amount which would have been due had the appropriate Tracker interest rate been applied to the mortgage account, the suitability of any alternative repayment arrangements and any other relevant information held by the Bank.  Of these 22 accounts, 10 were Home Loan accounts and 12 were Buy To Let accounts.  All of these cases (bar one where the property was repossessed having been abandoned) were customer led sales or voluntary surrenders.  Each loss of ownership customer was offered a comprehensive redress and compensation package, which included the redress of the mortgage account, a significant minimum compensation amount (&euro;25K for BTLs and &euro;50K for Home Loans) and the compensation may also have included a write-off of any outstanding shortfall balance on the account, a refund of any repayments made to the account since the loss of ownership, a payment in respect of any increase in the property value from the date of sale and in the case of certain Home Loan customers additional supports where the customer is approved for a new mortgage which would be on the appropriate Tracker interest rate.  Each Loss of ownership Customer also has the right of appeal to an Independent Review Panel.PTSB is also participating in the industry wide Tracker Review as detailed by the CBI earlier this year. PTSB is fully co-operating with the review which is currently underway.&quot;<\/p><p><b>BOI<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;In 2015 the Central Bank of Ireland announced that it would conduct a Tracker Mortgage Examination with all lenders in Ireland.

These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.

I am assured by Revenue that they attach a high priority to combatting the smuggling of controlled drugs and are very active, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in targeting this criminal activity and those responsible for it. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue deploys two Customs Cutters, two large-scale X-Ray scanners and several mobile scanners.  Revenue currently deploys seventeen detector dog teams, nine of which have drug detection capabilities.\u00a0 I am advised by Revenue that the cost of training a dog is estimated at &euro;25,000 and the time to train a team is 8 weeks.\u00a0 The number of dog units is a matter that is kept under ongoing review by Revenue in light of intelligence and overall assumption of risk by them.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the risk focused approach to the discharge of its role in relation to illegal drugs importations, harbours and inlets along the coastline are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis from the point of view of the potential for smuggling.  This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, aimed at encouraging members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities etc. to notify Revenue in confidence of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through a confidential 24\/7 Drugs Watch free phone facility.

In particular, Revenue attaches importance at national level to having good working relationships with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service.  A Joint Task Force arrangement is in place to enhance and support these relationships and there is regular contact and cooperation between these agencies.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the number of their officers assigned permanently to airports represents only a small part of the overall effort made by them in conjunction with the other State agencies.  Revenue places a strong emphasis on a strong intelligence-led risk analysis focus at regional, national and international level and it deploys whatever resources are required to the areas of highest risk.  The Joint Task Force fully supports this flexible approach.<\/p>  <p>  In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including drug smuggling.  This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has assigned a Europol Liaison Officer to Europol Headquarters, a Revenue attach&eacute; in London and a Country Liaison Officer to the Maritime Operations and Analysis Centre Narcotics in Lisbon.  At national level Revenue has signed over forty-three Memoranda of Understanding with various organisations and with international travel and trade service providers. <\/p>  <p>  This pooling of intelligence between the agencies at national and international level accords with best worldwide practice and enhances the focus on counteracting drug trafficking and the dismantling of drug organisations. Revenue has a permanent resource at the main airports comprising officers, trained sniffer dogs and technological supports such as scanners.  These are supplemented by specialist staff and supported by Gardai as required.  At regional airports and smaller airfields, there are regular, random and targeted interventions, based on information from the intelligence network described above.  Overall, Revenue staff are flexibly deployed to airports and other demands as needed, so that the effective resource is much larger than the 214 staff who are permanently assigned to the main airports.  Revenue is satisfied that their staffing and organisation are satisfactory and are effective to the highest international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600061#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":210,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 114 and 115 answered with Question No. 112.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Powers","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600061#WRF02850"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[38513\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600061#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the procedures which are applied by the customs division to detect ingested drugs on passengers arriving here via ports and airports, further to the Supreme Court ruling which found that passengers cannot be asked to provide a urine sample; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that suspicion of ingestion of drugs would be based on direct indicators such as intelligence, interview with the passenger, or obvious illness or discomfort.\u00a0 Supplementary and indirect indicators would include searches of baggage or the person, baggage scans, detector dogs, profiling and passenger behaviour.\u00a0 If the level of evidence-based suspicion is high, the Gardai are invited to consider whether the person should be arrested on suspicion of having ingested drugs.\u00a0 Any necessary further tests are then carried out by the Gardai at a suitable place of detention. <\/p>  <p>  The relevant Supreme Court Judgments (DPP v Gormley and DPP v White, judgments delivered together on 6 March 2014 by Mr Justice Clarke, Supreme Court record numbers 107\/11 and 92\/12) significantly clarified the rights of suspects both in interrogation after arrest, and in the taking of samples after arrest.

The report cautioned that reliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by reductions in public expenditure.  The report specifically recommended against providing reliefs for those who had paid stamp duty.  The reasons given were that such relief would not be targeted on need; that the tax structure was known to house purchasers at the time of purchase; that the selling price of the property may have been affected by the stamp duty paid and that the stamp duty revenues would have been spent on the provision of public services.<\/p>  <p>  While some taxpayers had a significant Stamp Duty liability, they may have been able to claim mortgage interest relief on interest of up to &euro;20,000 per annum.

If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.\u00a0 The first of what is expected to be a series of\u00a0meetings is scheduled for this week\u00a0 between the GMIT executive and the HEA to discuss a number of issues\u00a0relating to the financial position of the Institute including those which are specific to the Castlebar campus.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial\u00a0difficulties\u00a0being experienced by a number of the\u00a0IoTs.  The Financial Review of the Institutes, recently undertaken\u00a0by the HEA in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the IoT sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future, makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IoT sector\u00a0can be addressed.  These policy recommendations will feed into the work being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so. \u00a0In seeking\u00a0to address the issue in the short term,\u00a0I have\u00a0for the first time in nine years secured\u00a0as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector.  In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee\u00a0and this consultation will form\u00a0part of the process\u00a0of formulating a plan for the future of the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0will include\u00a0an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.\u00a0 In this context it\u00a0will\u00a0identify key elements of the new funding model\u00a0and of\u00a0the expected impacts including those\u00a0on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  The policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work\u00a0by the Oireachtas Committee\u00a0in relation to the Cassells report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600062#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600063#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[38419\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600063#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the action his Department will take to increase pupil capacity in a school (details supplied) in order that the problems outlined by a person will be addressed.","asker":"1281","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of an application for major capital works from the Post Primary school referred to. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is currently reviewing the demographic demand in the area serviced by the schools referred to.\u00a0 As the Deputy may be aware my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.

It included an examination of\u00a0the impact of decline in the State grant in the years since 2008 and looked at projections assuming a static State funding environment.\u00a0It has made a number of policy recommendations which will feed into the work on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs\u00a0which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation. If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial\u00a0difficulties\u00a0being experienced by a number of the IoTs. The Financial Review by the HEA\u00a0was based on the assumption that static Exchequer funding coupled with continuing growth in student numbers could make a number of Institutes unsustainable. The Report recognised the need to examine the underlying sustainability issues that existed across the sector and highlighted the need for a review of how funding is being allocated given the significant changes that are occurring in the higher education sector.\u00a0It makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IOT sector\u00a0can be addressed.\u00a0The Report clearly identified the need for a review of the present funding model and I have asked that this be completed as a matter of urgency. <\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.\u00a0In seeking\u00a0to address the issue in the short term,\u00a0I have for the first time in nine years secured\u00a0as part of Budget\u00a02017, additional funding for the sector. In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July, outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.

The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0will include\u00a0an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.\u00a0In this context it\u00a0will\u00a0identify key elements of the new funding model\u00a0and of\u00a0the expected impacts including those\u00a0on employers.

While originally just for widows, an equivalent payment was subsequently introduced for widowers.  More recently, with the introduction of civil partnership, my Department extended an equivalent support to surviving civil partners from 2011, when the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force.  The scheme now also includes bereaved spouses of legally married same-sex couples.  <\/p>  <p>  While the introduction of marriage equality legislation is a welcome step forward, it cannot have the effect of making previous relationships, which ended through bereavement before its introduction, marriages in the legal sense.  It is not possible legally to retrospectively marry people, or to make them civil partners after the death of one of the couple.<\/p>  <p>  There is no age criteria attached to the Widows, widowers and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, or criteria requiring such a marriage or civil partnership to have been entered into before a certain age.  Provided a person was legally married or in a civil partnership at the time of the bereavement, and provided the other conditions such as PRSI are met, a person may qualify for a payment.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the State pension, a pensioner&rsquo;s partner may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult if they are wholly or mainly maintained by them.  This payment can be made regardless of whether they are married, in a civil partnership, or simply cohabiting.  A cohabitant is one of two adults (whether of the same or opposite sex) who live together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship and who are not close relatives. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600067#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600067#WRM02800"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[38322\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600067#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a domiciliary care allowance in respect of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from this lady on the 21st July 2016.

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.<\/p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows\/Widowers\/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).<\/p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rate of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.<\/p>  <p>  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.<\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  The changes did not impact upon whether someone qualified for a pension, nor whether they would qualify for the full rate.  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.<\/p>  <p>  The principle that the rate of a State pension contributory should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to so that we can fund such pensions into the future.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would not just have penalised those who had paid into the system over the course of their lives, but it would also have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not generally receive reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10 m annually.<\/p>  <p>  In 2008, the maximum personal rate of the contributory pensions was &euro;223.30, and the maximum rate for the non-contributory pension was &euro;212. Despite negative inflation in the intervening period, these payments have already been increased by &euro;10, before taking into account a further &euro;5 increase next year.  While reverting to the 2008 rates of payments would be of benefit to pensioners who have significant other means and who contributed less to the Social Insurance Fund, it would be of no benefit to those who contributed to the system all their lives, nor would it be to that half of our elderly who rely solely on the State pension for their income.  I am satisfied that the across the board increases, which benefit everyone, have been a more appropriate approach in Budget 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[38500\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to outline the compensation he is putting in place for former workers at a company (details supplied) with unpurchased pensionable years as part of their overall compensation package; the details of such compensation; the way in which and when it will be paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>I do understand that the members concerned are anxious that these matters are settled in a timely manner.

There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.<\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced. This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.<\/p>  <p>  The principle that the rate of a State pension contributory should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to so that we can fund such pensions into the future.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not generally receive reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10 m annually.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN03350"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[38753\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when payment will commence in respect of a carer's allowance application that was awarded after an appeal on the part of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>As a result of an appeals officer&rsquo;s decision, carer&rsquo;s allowance was awarded to the person concerned on 5 December 2016 and the first payment will issue to her nominated bank account on 8 December 2016.

The funding standard is a wind-up standard, and is intended to approximate the monies needed to secure the benefits if the scheme was wound up and the accrued benefits bought out.  Any reduction in the funding standard would not improve a scheme&rsquo;s ability to pay the benefits as they fall due.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance it is the responsibility of the trustees of a pension scheme to ensure compliance with the funding standard and other obligations set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The existence of the funding standard is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded.  The responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.<\/p>  <p>  Public companies are obliged to report on any defined benefit schemes in their annual financial statements.  The basis of these calculations is defined in the relevant accounting standards and is independent of the Irish funding standard.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the independent body responsible for regulating the funding standard.  If a scheme does not meet the funding standard, a funding proposal must be submitted to the Authority in accordance with the time limits detailed in the Pensions Act.  It should be noted that the Irish funding standard is less demanding in comparison to almost all other European countries.  Accordingly, I have no plans to review it.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority requires that, in setting investment policy, the trustees of a DB scheme must have regard to the need to satisfy at regular intervals the minimum funding standard set down in the Pensions Act.  However a number of steps have been taken to reduce the risks to pension scheme members caused by market volatility.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 required a DB scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; by 2023.  This function of this &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; is to provide some protection and long term stability for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Additionally, and in appropriate circumstances, the regulator may approve scheme funding proposals that provide for the recovery of their schemes funding over longer periods that was previously the case.<\/p>  <p>  In order to provide increased investment options for pension schemes the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 and 2011 introduced the option for trustees to purchase sovereign annuities.  Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities or the underlying bonds benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the funding standard.  Buying sovereign annuities for the pensioners has the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the funding standard and provides additional funds for the other members of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The situation of defined benefit funding is being actively monitored by the Department and the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600068#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disablement Benefit","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[38802\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will reopen an application for benefit in respect of a person (details supplied) with a view to granting them the benefit; and if he will expedite a positive response.","asker":"1248","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>Disablement benefit is one of the payments under the occupational injuries benefit scheme operated by my Department.

I want to pay tribute to Ms Murad&rsquo;s extraordinary bravery and her leadership in campaigning to protect and uphold the rights of her people. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to record my absolute and unreserved condemnations of the vile and criminal acts committed against the Yazidis by the terrorist group Daesh.  These crimes continue to this day, against Yazidis held captive by Daesh. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2015, Ireland addressed UN Human Rights Council on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry report which stated that the crime of genocide had been committed against the Yazidis, saying &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s report details unimaginable crimes. The suffering of the victims of Daesh&rsquo;s terrorism and hatred is laid bare before this Council in the report. This Council and the membership of the United Nations have an inarguable duty to end these crimes and work to achieve justice and accountability for the victims of these crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has long made clear its full support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Together with over 50 Member States of the United Nations, Ireland co-sponsored a proposed resolution to this effect in 2014. Ireland regards the failure of the proposed resolution as a breach of the Security Council&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Charter. Ireland repeats its call for the Security Council to uphold international law and act on this report by referring the situation in Syria to the Court. It is intolerable that the terrorist perpetrators of the most heinous crimes would be granted impunity by the action of any member of the United Nations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland urges that all States engaged in countering Daesh in Syria and Iraq should place the protection of civilian populations, especially minorities at particular risk from Daesh&rsquo;s murderous ideology of hate, as a priority in their instructions to members of their security forces  .&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  I have previously informed the Oireachtas that it is our policy that the responsibility for a legal determination of the crime of genocide is a matter for a legally competent and internationally recognised court.  I regard the report of the Commission of Inquiry and its findings of genocide as authoritative and I repeat our long-standing demand that the Security Council fulfil its obligations under international law and act to ensure that the Yazidis can seek accountability for Daesh&rsquo;s crimes before the International Criminal Court or another legally competent international tribunal.  There can be no impunity for the horrific crimes committed against the Yazidis. <\/p>  <p>  Given the continuing conflict and the ongoing threat of terrorism in Sinjar and Nineveh, the resettlement of the Yazidis and other minority populations in their ancient homelands remains too dangerous to implement immediately.  However, this must be a priority for Ireland and its international partners, together with international action to ensure the protection of these populations after their return to their homes. <\/p>  <p>  Funding from the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, has been provided to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people inside Iraq, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have been displaced internally, or who have fled to neighbouring countries.  Funding is channelled through Irish Aid&rsquo;s NGO partners and UN organisations, who are best placed to respond, and is used to provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed access to food, health, water and sanitation services, with a particular focus on the protection of children, women and the most vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>  So far in 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;1.5 million to Iraq, channelled through the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund, to provide life-saving assistance to the estimated 10 million people affected by violence in Iraq.  The Humanitarian Pooled Fund supports the implementation of the Iraq Humanitarian Response Plan, which aims to meet the critical needs of displaced people. In Erbil and Dahuk Governorates, in particular, this includes members of the Yazidi community. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in October, the Irish Government dispatched 80 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies under the Rapid Response initiative.

We support the aspirations of the countries involved in the accession process, including Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed the publication by the Commission of the latest annual progress reports on each of the five candidate and two potential candidate countries on 9 November.  The detailed reports give a &lsquo;state of play&rsquo; assessment on the preparations for Union membership in each accession country across the acquis communautaire and set out guidelines on reform priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Serbia was granted candidate status for EU membership in March 2012, and accession negotiations were opened in 28 June 2013, during the Irish EU Presidency.  To date, four chapters have been opened, including the two &lsquo;fundamentals first&rsquo; chapters on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights (Chapter 23) and on Justice, Freedom and Security   (Chapter 24) in July of this year.  It is expected that further chapters will be opened before year-end. Serbia has finalised rule of law action plans, reached key agreements with Kosovo, and been pro-active in developing regional co-operation with its neighbours.  It has also embarked on an ambitious economic reform agenda.<\/p>  <p>  We are pleased with the substantial progress made by Serbia so far on its European path, and we agree with the Commission&rsquo;s report that there is still a need for further reform, including in the areas of public administration and the business environment.  The Serbian government has demonstrated their commitment to EU accession at political level by making it a priority goal in their programme for government.<\/p>  <p>  Montenegro was granted candidate status in 2010.  Accession negotiations began in 2012, and 24 chapters have been opened.  The Commission&rsquo;s report recognises the considerable work on alignment with and preparation for the implementation of the acquis, which has already taken place.  It acknowledges the constructive role which the country plays in enhancing regional cooperation.  Advances in the rule of law have been made and the legal and institutional framework have been strengthened.  The report recommends that Montenegro should now focus on its economic and monetary policy.<\/p>  <p>  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as it is called in the EU negotiations (though we use the name &ldquo;Macedonia&rdquo; in our bilateral relations) has been a candidate country since 2005.  However, the opening of accession negotiations has been stalled, first as a result of difficult bilateral issues with neighbours and then by the ongoing political crisis.  It is now contingent on the continued implementation of the Pr&zcaron;ino agreement (2015) and substantial progress in the implementation of the \"Urgent Reform Priorities\".  Having been postponed twice already this year, elections are now scheduled to take place on 11 December.  We hope they will be free and fair and that the renewed opportunity they represent for the country to mitigate the divisive political culture in Macedonia and enhance its capacity to implement much needed reforms will be seized. <\/p>  <p>  Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 and was granted candidate status in 2010.  However, negotiations were halted after elections in 2013 and in March 2015 the then government requested that \"Iceland should not be regarded as a candidate country for EU membership\".  Elections took place in October 2016 and no change in Iceland&rsquo;s EU aspirations has yet been signalled by the new government.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s progress reports are still being examined in detail at official level and it is hoped that Ministers will be able to reach agreement on an appropriate response at the General Affairs Council on 13 December.  For the sake of completeness, the countries which will be under consideration, in addition to those mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, are Turkey and Albania (candidate countries), together with Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina and Kosovo (potential candidates).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Data","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO03500"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[38781\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of first-time applications for Irish passports in the past three years to date in 2016 by county and jurisdiction, including the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>The number of first time passport applications, broken down by &lsquo;county of birth&rsquo; of applicants in Ireland and Northern Ireland, are set out in the following tables for 2014, 2015 and up to the end of November this year.

Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.<\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Fresh Start, a three-person Panel was appointed last December to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups.  This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the June review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.  In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. <\/p>  <p>  On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The Fresh Start Agreement provides that the IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021.  The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law.  The aim is to get the IRC established and up and running as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. <\/p>  <p>  The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. <\/p>  <p>  In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. <\/p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO04700"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[38434\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600069#WRO04800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the channels available to members of the public that are not employees to make a protected disclosure in instances in which they have a belief they have evidence of significant wide spread or systemic malpractice and policy failure in areas of the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>As the<b><\/b>Deputy\u00a0may be\u00a0aware, my Department is responsible for the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which provides statutory protections to workers in the private, public and not-for-profit sectors against reprisals in circumstances where they disclose information related to wrongdoing that has come to their attention in connection with their employment.

The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  It does this by facilitating\u00a0quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy who has responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF)\u00a0can be heard by Government.  SMEs are also encouraged to register of the Government's etenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.<\/p><p>The OGP\u00a0works\u00a0with\u00a0the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the\u00a0engagement of SMEs in public procurement.

These events were attended by over 900\u00a0businesses and buyers from across the public sector, North and South, which focused on the opportunities for SMEs with major public sector buyers across the island<\/p><p>Similar events took place in 2015 and more are planned for 2017.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Minister\u00a0of State Murphy\u00a0launched the OGPs in September.  The data analysed indicates that 95% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of\u00a0the spend\u00a0analysed is with SMEs.  Equally important, in terms of SME access to government business, is the report's highlighting that, in the majority of spend areas, the typical tender value is less &euro;100,000.  The OGP has also conducted an analysis of the 94 Framework Agreements it has concluded to date.  The\u00a0data shows that 68% of Framework members are SMEs and 63% of the Frameworks had multiple lots, facilitating SME access.  These findings show that SMEs are successful in Public Procurement competitions in Ireland and the initiatives outlined will ensure they continue to\u00a0compete and be successful in\u00a0future Public Tendering opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600070#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Parks Conveniences","counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600070#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[38554\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600070#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works will improve toilet facilities at the Phoenix Park for families using the park; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>The Commissioners of Public Works provide public toilet facilities at the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre.

Over the coming months it is essential that the health service plans effectively for expected surges in emergency care demand.  My Department, working with the HSE, has been driving a range of measures to improve patient ED experience times. <\/p>  <p>  Following the formation of Government an additional &euro;40 million was provided to assist in the management of winter pressures.  Utilising this additional funding the HSE developed the Winter Initiative Plan 2016 &ndash; 2017 which was published in September.  Key aspects of this plan are being implemented at hospital and community services level across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that as of 2 December 2016, the remaining balance of the winter initiative to be spent is &euro;6.6m.  The HSE are confident the remainder of the funding will be fully spent by the end of the year in order to help as many patients as possible. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key targets of the Winter Initiative is to reduce delayed discharges nationally from 638 at the commencement of this initiative to less than 500 by the end of the year.  The HSE is on course to meet this target with the number of delayed discharges nationally now at 525, as of end November.  Over 4,100 patients have availed of Community Intervention Team services, meaning that these patients were able to avoid hospital or be discharged earlier from hospital. <\/p>  <p>  Also under the Initiative, over 3,300 patients have availed of aids and appliances, enabling them to be discharged from hospital sooner.  420 additional homecare packages have been made available and 190 additional transitional care beds have been approved since early October.  These have enabled patients to be discharged from hospital back to their homes or to alternative transitional care centres.  In addition, 18 step-down beds have opened in the Mercy Hospital in Cork.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 December the HSE convened a Winter Initiative Health Summit where I met with Hospital Group CEOs, as well as hospital and Community Health Organisation managers, to reinforce the importance of driving key performance improvements across primary, acute and social care to reduce ED overcrowding and to plan for expected surges in demand in our EDs in the New Year.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and the wider health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600071#WRQ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600071#WRQ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[38381\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600071#WRQ05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children in County Wexford on a waiting list for occupational therapy; the number of children in County Wexford awaiting occupational therapy services for up to 12 months, up to 24 months and up to 36 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":733,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600071#WRQ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Expenditure","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":736,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[38382\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total amount of money spent on cyber and IT security by each hospital across all seven hospital groups for each of the years 2013 to 2016 to date in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":737,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[38384\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of money ring-fenced under budget 2017 for the progression of the new ambulance station in Edenderry, County Offaly, as was committed to by the Minister for State with responsibility for health promotion in a recent local meeting with the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>I can confirm that considerable progress has been made on the Edenderry ambulance base project to date.

Every effort is made to ensure that forensics mental health care provision is in accordance with the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, including legal considerations and person-centred and recovery-based approaches on an inter-agency basis.<\/p><p>In relation to Recommendation 15.1.1, all prisoners are medically assessed on committal to prison.  This includes a mental health assessment which can be employed to develop an individual care plan.  Where clinically indicated, the prisoner is referred to a forensic clinician who, subject to his\/her findings, may make certain recommendations to the Governor for the care of the prisoner.  Prisoners on release, are entitled to be referred to the HSE  mental health services in the normal way. <\/p><p>In regard to 15.1.2, the National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) at the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) at Dundrum provides a Mental Health Prison In-Reach and Court Diversion Service (PICLS) programme to the Irish Prison Service.  The diversion system ensures as far as possible that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately.  This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison, under sentence.  An Interdepartmental Group is looking at what further improvements can be made on the issue of persons with mental illness and their interaction with the Criminal Justice System. <\/p><p>The recommendation reflected  in 15.1.3 refers to increasing community based forensic mental  health teams.  Full multi-disciplinary teams will be established in 2017 connected to Castlerea, Limerick and Cork prisons.  <\/p><p>Planning permission for a new modern Forensic mental health facility in Portrane to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, was granted in June 2015.  Phase 1 of the project comprises a new 120-bed hospital, as reflected in Recommendation 15.1.4, along with a new 10-bed Child and Adolescent Mental Health unit (Recommendation 15. 1.6) and a new 10-bed Mental Health Intellectual Disability unit (Recommendation 15.1.7).  I was pleased to secure the significant additional capital funding in Budget 2017, to allow construction to commence on Phase 1 early next year, with a view to the new facilities coming on-stream in 2019.  Phase 2 of the project envisages the provision of regional Intensive Care Rehabilitation Units, as resources allow over the longer term.<\/p><p>In relation to 15.1.5, there are a number of prison based multi-disciplinary groups that provide information and support in the area of mental health to prisoners.  There are consultant-led forensic mental health in-reach teams in all the prisons in Ireland at present except for Castlerea where it is hoped to provide an appropriate service in early 2017.  The Irish Prison Service (IPS) is seeking to advance a robust system that would see integration and further development of services with statutory and voluntary partners.  Mental health service provision in prisons must form part of the overall community response to this cohort of prisoners.  Current arrangements with the Central Mental Hospital are a good example of collaborative working.  In addition to healthcare input, the IPS Psychology Service provides ongoing evidence informed therapeutic approaches to those referred to the service who are suffering from mental health difficulties.<\/p><p>The implementation of Recommendations 15.1.8 and 15.1.9 are being progressed on a joint basis by the health and judicial systems.  This involves, for example, the HSE National Forensic Mental Health service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  The NFMHS provides regular training to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda training college at Templemore also delivers training as part of the training of all new Garda trainees.  The Forensic service provides an advisory service to the Garda negotiation team, and has established links to local garda&iacute;.  In 2017 it is planned to develop structured links to Divisional garda&iacute;.  Good progress has been made in recent years, arising from the significant additional funding given to mental health, including the modernisation of the NFMHS and by progressing the work of the Interdepartmental Group on those with mental health issues coming into contact with the criminal justice system.<\/p><p>I recently commenced a review of all aspects of <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, to help inform policy and service development in the future.  In this regard, I will bear in mind the issues raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[38427\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600072#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of counties which have a seven-day support team for mental health;

The types of trials authorised range from first-in-man trials for new medicines to studies with medicines which already have marketing authorisations.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical trials in Ireland are governed by the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, S.I.

A trial site can be defined as any location where trial-related activities are conducted.  Therefore, an inspection can occur at an investigator site, sponsor company site, laboratory site, manufacturing site or at other establishments deemed appropriate by the regulatory authority.  The HPRA also requires that an annual safety report is submitted for any trial which is ongoing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Any member of the public who has concerns over the conduct of a specific clinical trial for a medicinal product should contact the HPRA in the first instance.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.<\/p>  <p>  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 620,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would not be appropriate to comment on data submitted by manufacturers of a medicinal product to the EMA as part of their market authorisation processes or monitoring of its safety following authorisation for use.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the vaccine has caused the observed effect, this may also been caused by a new disease the patient developed.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  In the context of monitoring the safety of vaccines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are undertaken to consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  The EMA completed its detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions.  In line with its initial recommendations, the EMA confirms that the evidence does not support a causal link between the HPV vaccine sand development of the two conditions studied.  Therefore there is no reason to change the way the vaccines are used or to amend the current product information.  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence and did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the EMA, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all members states.<\/p>  <p>  The review recognised that, at that time, more than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received these vaccines, and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for vaccination.  Use of these vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb, which is responsible for over 20,000 deaths in Europe each year) and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of media reports that the authorities in Demark and Japan have taken some measures concerning HPV immunisation in their countries.

This group was established by my Department  in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. <\/p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, for assisting with mapping and  developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'.<\/p>  <p>  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which will be entering a consultation stage very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan.  ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work. <\/p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research.  Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686 million, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224 million.  The total funding of &euro;2.91 million is shared between 14 charities.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in 2017.  The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015.  Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.  Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases' patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE has advised my Department that its Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee which will parallel the National Cancer Control Programme Technology Review Committee.<\/p>  <p>  This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group. <\/p>  <p>  The national plan for Rare Diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings. Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600074#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600074#WRT02750"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[38607\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600074#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to the budget 2017 announcement of additional funding being made to the NTPF, the evaluation mechanisms that are in place to ensure value for money in terms of the spend; the evaluation mechanisms in place to ensure satisfactory outcomes and number of treatments in accordance with the funding allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases. Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.<\/p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: <\/p><blockquote>-  2012 &ndash; 8 cases; <br \/><br \/>-  2013 &ndash; 13 cases; <br \/><br \/>-  2014 &ndash; 18 cases; <br \/><br \/>-  2015 &ndash; 12 cases.<\/blockquote><p>This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million population. <\/p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease. The week beginning May 2nd was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. <\/p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.<\/p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:<\/p><blockquote>-  Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass; <br \/><br \/>-  Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses); <br \/><br \/>-  Wooded and forested areas; <br \/><br \/>-  Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches; <br \/><br \/>-  Parkland areas; and <br \/><br \/>-  Open fields and bushes.<\/blockquote><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week. <\/p><p>Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against contracting Lyme borelliosis.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October:<\/p><blockquote>-  Arms and leg should be covered; wearing long trousers tucked into socks or boots, and long-sleeved shirts with cuffs fastened is advised.  Shoes or boots should be worn rather than open-toed sandals.<br \/><br \/>-  The use of insect repellent on clothes is recommended, or on limbs if it is not practicable to cover up.  DEET or permethrin (insect repellents) can be used &ndash; advice can be obtained from pharmacies.<br \/><br \/>-  Skin and clothing should be inspected for ticks every three to four hours and children's skin and clothes checked frequently.<br \/><br \/>-  Ticks should be removed as soon as they are seen attached to the skin.  Further advice on tick removal can be obtained from the HPSC website.<br \/><br \/>-  It is not recommended that antibiotics are given to prevent the transmission of Lyme disease following a tick bite.  Only if the area becomes inflamed may treatment be required; and advice should be sought from a doctor.<br \/><br \/>-  People should see their doctor if they develop a rash or become unwell with other symptoms, letting the doctor know of exposure to ticks.<\/blockquote><p>Further advice can be obtained from the HPSC website () and the HPSC produced a leaflet on &ldquo;Protecting Yourself Against Tick Bites and Lyme Disease  &rdquo; which is available for the public to download.<\/p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600076#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600076#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":957,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[38770\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600076#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a procedure for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":958,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The level of afforestation grant and premiums, allied to the tax treatment of income from forests provide good incentives for landowners to plant a proportion of their holding.

The Programme is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including Knowledge Transfer (KT) programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The RDP also includes the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS), which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various actions such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands, while at the same time addressing other environmental threats such as biodiversity and water quality.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is directly targeted at the climate emissions of 30,000 beef farmers.  Its objective is to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example, Ecological Focus Areas and maintenance of permanent pasture under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.<\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme.  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned mitigation technologies in agriculture itself.  Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transfer of Entitlements Application","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[38283\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will review a matter (details supplied) regarding entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>My Department received five 2014 Transfer of Entitlement application forms in respect of a Transferor  seeking the transfer of entitlements by sale to five separate Transferees.

This Act prescribes the functions of the Minister and details the requirements, rights and obligations in relation to Felling Licences.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Department promotes Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) as a central principle of Irish forest policy, whereby forests are managed to provide economic, social and environmental benefits on a sustainable basis for both current and future generations.  All proposed forestry operations that are licensed must be carried out to ensure the implementation of SFM in Ireland.  There are many factors taken into consideration in the process to determine whether or not a licence will be granted, including compliance with environmental legislation and good forest practice.<\/p>  <p>  Until recently the majority of clear felling and replanting has been concentrated in the public estate.  A significant portion of the private forest estate, particularly conifers, that were afforested in the 1980s and the early 1990s are now approaching a stage where forest owners are considering the best time to fell.  In some cases forests will be thinned and other case clearfelled depending on a variety of different reasons such as site and market conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The age at which it is best to harvest a forest depends on many things, including volume production, the risk of windblow, sawmill requirements regarding log sizes and current market prices.  Forest owners may wish to fell early, delay felling or in some cases not fell at all for their own reasons.  In some cases the landowner may apply for a licence to fell early if it is felt that the stand of trees is susceptible to windblow.  Felling licences would normally be granted in such cases.  What is of utmost importance for the Department is to ensure through the felling licence system that the felling and replanting is carried out in a manner that accords with sustainable forest management principles.  A licence application that does not accord with sustainable forest management principles may be refused or have conditions added to the licence to ensure that it would accord with sustainable forest management principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Quotas","counter":1019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[38340\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600077#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the new Irish fishing quotas; the details of the medium-term strategy of the Government for this industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>At this time, it is not possible to provide a full breakdown of the 2017 Irish fishing quotas.

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Deputy will be aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to\u00a0repeat here again this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements. <\/p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme.  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market in January 2017.  I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. <\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to\u00a0cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year\u00a0in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced\u00a0on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with balancing payments from the 1st\u00a0December.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore Balancing Payments commenced on 1 December and to date\u00a0&euro;1,126 billion has been paid out to 120,926 farmers and payments are ongoing.  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a measure under the TAMS Scheme specifically for the Tillage Sector.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no specific funding available for losses due to poor weather conditions I wish to confirm that at Agriculture Council I have repeatedly called for the situation on agricultural markets to be kept under ongoing review, and have said that we should be ready to deploy support measures if the circumstances require it. At the October Council Minister of State Doyle followed this up with a specific request that market support efforts be extended to the cereals sector. <\/p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600078#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Maintenance","counter":1053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600078#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[38499\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600078#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the need for a spooling winch at the pier or slipway in Ardmore, County Waterford, to assist local fishermen; if funding will be provided for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1055,"content":"<p>The pier and slipway in Ardmore are owned by Waterford County Council and responsibility for their repair, development and maintenance rests with that Local Authority and its parent Department, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

Figures for the year so far to the week ending 27th November 2016 show that approximately\u00a074,000 extra cattle have been slaughtered so far this year compared to the same period in 2015, an increase of 5.3%.<\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the impact that the expansion in the national dairy herd will have on the Irish beef herd and this matter was discussed by all stakeholders at the most recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable.  The true impact any increase in the number of cattle in the national herd will have on the beef market will be determined by different factors such as slaughter dates which\u00a0will vary depending on the system of production on different farms.

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050. Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the\u00a0Act. <\/p>  <p>  Work is well underway on the development of the first statutory\u00a0National Mitigation Plan (NMP), required under Section 4 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.\u00a0The primary objective of the first NMP is to track implementation of measures already underway, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce GHG emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the NMP   will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures can be put in place beyond this date and out to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0first NMP is\u00a0being developed having regard to the low carbon transition vision set out in the\u00a0National Policy Position, Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current Effort Sharing Decision No 406\/2009\/EC, the Paris Agreement, and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 Climate and Energy Package. A key part of developing the NMP has been the preparation of appropriate technical, environmental and economic analysis to inform the decision-making process as to what should be included in the plan. These analyses are still on-going as part of the iterative approach to the development of the plan. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Ireland's response to the\u00a0global\u00a0challenge of climate change, this\u00a0is driven by the Paris Agreement which entered into force on 4th November 2016. Ireland signed the Agreement in April of this year and completed the ratification process last month. The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At COP21 in Paris, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland will provide at least &euro;175 million in public funding to climate finance, mainly for adaptation in developing countries by 2020. Ireland is also making a &euro;2m contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) this year with further contributions to follow in 2017 and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the emission-reduction objectives of the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its\u00a0Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The specific details of the contribution to this 40% to be made by each Member State in respect of the non-ETS sector was the subject of a European Commission proposal published in July 2016. The full implications of this proposal from a domestic perspective are currently being examined, with Ireland being ambitious to make a contribution that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair in terms of sharing the\u00a0low carbon transition effort\u00a0among Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":1120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1121,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[38654\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there is grant aid available for solar farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1122,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The Programme for Government\u00a0contains a commitment to\u00a0facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland.

Over the past 5 years, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to \u00a0commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the \u00a0remaining 30%, consisting of over 750,00 premises, 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland, \u00a0will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.

My Department is conducting further analysis with a view to identifying and locking down the Map for the remainder of the procurement process. This work will conclude shortly and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. <\/p><p>Direct feedback from consumers continues to be important and\u00a0if customers\u00a0cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. <\/p><p>The procurement process for the State Intervention aims to identify an entity or entities to build, roll out, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30\u00a0Mbps\u00a0upload and 6\u00a0Mbps\u00a0download speeds to all premises within the intervention area.<\/p><p>The three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution under the State Intervention meaning that much higher broadband speeds are possible.

On 5 July the Government selected\u00a0the Commercial Stimulus Model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer. The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premise in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, has modelled the likely cost of various technologies and ownership models. It would not be\u00a0appropriate\u00a0to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while\u00a0a major public\u00a0procurement process is underway.

Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process. <\/p>  <p>  On 29 September 2015, the Government's 6 year Capital Plan, Building on Recovery, was published. It\u00a0includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP).

The regulation of telecommunications operators is the statutory responsibility of the ComReg, which is independent in its functions. <\/p>  <p>  Both policy and regulation have contributed substantially to the roll out of high speed broadband networks in the last number of years. ComReg's NGA decisions in 2013 created the framework to drive accelerated investment in high speed broadband, which is now available to approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland. ComReg's multiband spectrum auction in 2012, has also allowed the extensive roll-out of 4G networks with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% population coverage. From a policy perspective the National Broadband Plan is also driving investment, and legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to allow ESB to use its network to deliver high speed broadband services, has resulted in fibre-to-the-home services being rolled out currently in 17 regional towns. <\/p>  <p>  In October, I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to auction spectrum in the 3.6GHz band (Wireless telegraphy (3.6GHz Band Licences) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.\u00a0 532 of 2016)). The\u00a0liberalisation of this band is an EU\u00a0requirement and the adoption of the 3.6 GHz EC Decision is mandatory for all EU Member States, including Ireland. This Decision is service-neutral, technology-neutral and expressly obliges Member States to allow the use of the entire 3.6GHz band fixed and mobile services. The release of spectrum in this band will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and\/or fixed wireless services, leading to\u00a0better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  ComReg is independent in its functions and I have no role in the process for allocating the spectrum which is now underway. Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter and the fact that a process is underway, it would not be appropriate for me to\u00a0comment further on the matter at this time. I would note however that the allocation process followed extensive public consultation by ComReg over almost a two year period. I have no reason to believe that the process being currently undertaken by ComReg will not result in the fair allocation of any future spectrum assignment and\u00a0I expect the outcome of the process to provide a level of certainty and transparency for all stakeholders. A policy direction is neither\u00a0necessary nor appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Investment decisions by the commercial telecommunications networks providers in the\u00a0electronic communications market, including investment decisions on the roll-out of Next Generation Access (NGA) are taken purely on commercial grounds by each network operator, having regard to the predicted investment cost and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment. The State can only intervene in this market in cases of clear market failure. In this regard the National Broadband Plan aims to bring competitively priced quality services to rural areas, through a State intervention to build a new high speed broadband network. It is envisaged that this network will offer wholesale services to multiple retailers, who can in turn offer competitive,\u00a0affordable and\u00a0high speed broadband\u00a0to users. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.

For the year 2020, the target set is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is\u00a0 the most demanding 2020 target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year. The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. <\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported that emissions for 2015 are estimated at 59.84 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which\u00a0is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014. According to the EPA, these figures indicate that Ireland will be in compliance with its 2015 annual limit set under the ESD. However, the Agency has cautioned that the 2015 emissions data suggests that achievement of our long-term mitigation goals will be difficult. Moreover, the most recent EPA projections (March 2016) indicate that emissions for 2020 could be in the range of 6% to 11% below 2005 levels depending on whether or not additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2014, are implemented. <\/p><p>At international level, Ireland will contribute to the 2015 Paris Agreement via the Nationally Determined Contribution tabled by the EU in March 2015 on behalf of Member States, which commits to at least a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). This is based on reductions in the ETS and non-ETS sectors of 43% and 30% respectively. The specific details of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this overall EU 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, are the subject of negotiations between the EU and Member States in the context of the European Commission Effort Sharing Regulation<b><\/b>Proposal, which was published on the 20 July 2016. The outcome of these deliberations will determine Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0contribution, which needs to\u00a0reflect a level of ambition that is\u00a0technically feasible, cost-effective and fair,\u00a0to the overall EU 2030 effort.<\/p><p>In terms of putting in place the first of a series of plans to manage our transition to a low carbon economy and to meet our international and EU targets, a national mitigation plan will be submitted to Government for approval by June 2017 in accordance with the 2015 Act. The preparation of the plan is designed to be a <i>&lsquo;whole-of-government&rsquo;<\/i>approach to tackle emissions and each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors has been requested by Government to develop sectorial mitigation measures. The primary objective of the mitigation plan, when finalised, will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional actions in the longer term to reduce emissions and progress the overall transition agenda to 2050. In advance of the statutory consultation on a draft mitigation plan, which will take place in Spring 2017, I intend to publish a document shortly for an initial non-statutory public consultation. The outcomes of the consultations will inform the preparation of the final National Mitigation Plan. <\/p><p>Mirroring the mitigation effort, the 2015 Act also provides for the making and submission to Government of iterative national adaptation frameworks which will specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors, and by local authorities, in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to exploit any beneficial opportunities that may arise. Work is progressing in relation to the first national framework, which must be submitted to Government for approval no later than 10 December 2017. <\/p><p>While the extent of the challenge presented by climate change, and the scale of the transformation required if Ireland is to move to a low carbon and climate resilient economy, are\u00a0evident, there is a clear and long-term global and national climate change policy direction in place, supported by a well-defined national statutory framework. Work is progressing to convert this policy ambition into actions to bring about the transformation required if we are to decarbonise our economy and build resilience to the inevitable impacts of global warming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":1152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1153,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[38876\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120600079#WRY03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress to date in meeting his Departments targets in respect of quality and access to broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1154,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services\u00a0to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.

The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids. In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the State Intervention.\u00a0As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.

However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of auditing mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.\u00a0 Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the task force, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.
