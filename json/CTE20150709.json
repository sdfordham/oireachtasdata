A key objective for NAMA in its management and ultimate disposal of the assets is to maximise the return to the State.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements for 2014 received a clear audit report, which issued on 29 April 2015.  Without qualifying my audit opinion, I have drawn attention to note 2.1 in the financial statements.  This describes NAMA&rsquo;s main funding source, which is in the form of short-term borrowing, with a Government guarantee.  The note explains the basis on which the board is satisfied that it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.<\/p> <p>  Some of the key financial highlights for 2014 are that NAMA generated a profit, after impairment, of &euro;458 million; interest on loans recognised in the year amounted to &euro;950 million; around &euro;7.6 billion was raised in 2014 from asset sales, which were divided between sales of loan assets amounting to &euro;3.4 billion and sales of underlying collateral amounting to &euro;4.2 billion; the 2014 impairment charge was &euro;137 million; the total accumulated impairment charge to end 2014 was &euro;3.5 billion, reflecting the deterioration in NAMA&rsquo;s expectation of total loan asset cashflows relative to the value of the remaining loans when they were taken on; the carrying value of loans and receivables at end 2014 was &euro;16.9 billion, before impairment; and by end 2014, NAMA had redeemed &euro;16.6 billion of its initial borrowing.<\/p> <p>  The largest single disposal of loan assets undertaken by NAMA since its establishment was in relation to a bundle of debtor connection portfolios disposed of in 2014.  The disposal was code named Project Eagle, and involved the bundling of the loans of all 55 debtor connections based in Northern Ireland.  The loans were secured by around 900 property assets and around 68% of the properties were located in Northern Ireland itself, 18% in the rest of Ireland, 12% in Great Britain and 2% elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  We have drawn up a figure, now on screen, to try to summarise the Project Eagle transaction.  At the time the loan bundle was sold, the par value of the loans, which is the amount the borrowers collectively owed NAMA, amounted to a total of around &euro;5.7 billion.  The carrying value of the loans before impairment was just under &euro;2.2 billion.  The difference of &euro;3.5 billion, or 61% of the par value, is accounted for mainly by the discount in the price paid by NAMA to the relevant banks when it acquired the loans in the bundle.<\/p> <p>  Much of the Project Eagle borrowing was in sterling and the sale was in sterling.  All the values, as presented in the figures on screen, are in euros, which is how they are accounted for in the NAMA accounts.  When the bundle of loans was sold, and after payment of disposal costs, NAMA received net proceeds from the sale amounting to just under &euro;1.4 billion.  As a result, the total loss on disposal was around &euro;783 million.  This was made up of impairment provisions previously booked amounting to &euro;572 million that crystallised when the sale went through plus a further loss of &euro;211 million incurred on disposal.<\/p> <p>  Under section 226 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, I am required every three years to carry out a review of the progress NAMA has made towards achieving its overall objectives.  Members will recall that the first report related to the period up to the end of 2012, which the committee examined last May or so.  The next report will cover NAMA&rsquo;s progress up to the end of 2015.  I reported in the first report on loan sales by NAMA up to the end of 2012.  Our analysis indicated that those sales resulted in NAMA securing net proceeds of &euro;1.4 billion.  Unlike Project Eagle, those disposals, taken together, resulted in a gain for NAMA of around &euro;112 million over and above the carrying value of the loans.  <\/p> <p>  Members may recall that, in the report, I recommended the NAMA board set an overall target rate of return and targets for the overall rates of return on disposals and on property that NAMA decides to hold and-or invest in.  These are the kinds of benchmarks commonly used by investors to guide investment and divestment decisions.  However, NAMA disagreed on the relevance of such measures for its business, on the basis that they would act as an unnecessary constraint on its flexibility, given the imperative that it be open to commercially sensible disposal opportunities when they arise.<\/p> <p>  I previously indicated to the committee that, when preparing the next section 226 report, I intended to look in detail at a sample of NAMA disposals and a sample of properties held by it for investment.  Given the scale of the loss incurred on the Project Eagle disposal, it was and remains my intention to examine that disposal further in the course of that work.  As I mentioned here a couple of weeks ago, planning work on the section 226 examination has commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The committee has invited us today to outline the background to the sale of the loans of Northern Ireland debtors, Project Eagle, and the process which was followed by NAMA in securing the sale.  We welcome the opportunity to put the facts on the record, that is, the fact as they are known to us.  In so far as there may have been some wrongdoing on the part of certain individuals at the periphery of the transaction in Northern Ireland - individuals who acted as advisers to potential purchasers - we are not in a position to comment as we have no knowledge of what may have taken place.  The facts, as they pertain to those individuals and their activities, are a matter for authorities in Northern Ireland to establish.  I note that in the past 24 hours, the PSNI has indicated it would be looking at that aspect of this issue.<\/p> <p>  However, in view of the very extensive commentary around this issue in recent days, which has conflated alleged wrongdoing involving individuals in Northern Ireland with the sale by NAMA of Project Eagle, I wish at the outset today to make four points very clear.  The NAMA sale process for Project Eagle was robust, competitive, and competitive right to the end, and secured the best outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  When NAMA became aware of a concern surrounding the participation of one of the bidders for Project Eagle, we immediately, and without hesitation, took steps to ensure that bidder withdrew from the process.  The third point is that no pressure from any source, political or otherwise, influenced NAMA in regard to the decision to sell the loans of Northern Ireland debtors or the decision to accept the winning bid from Cerberus.  The fourth point is that if a payment did find its way to an account in the Isle of Man, as has been alleged, then wherever such a payment came from, it most certainly did not come from NAMA or from proceeds due to NAMA under this sale.  In fact, NAMA had no knowledge of this alleged payment to Mr. Coulter by Brown Rudnick until recent days when it was put into the public domain.<\/p><p>I will outline the sequence of events in this sale.  As chairman both of the NAMA board and, since October 2011, the Northern Ireland advisory committee, I feel I am well placed to outline this sequence of events that led to the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio.  We first became aware of investor interest in purchasing the portfolio after the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, passed to us a letter he had received from the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Mr. Sammy Wilson, on 24 June 2013.  Mr. Wilson enclosed a copy of a letter, of the same date, that he had received from a law firm, Brown Rudnick, in which Brown Rudnick indicated that clients of the company were interested in acquiring the Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In his reply on 25 July 2013, and after his Department had consulted with us, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, pointed out to Mr. Wilson that parties interested in acquiring NAMA loans or assets securing NAMA loans should make direct contact with NAMA.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, also drew attention to NAMA's policy that loan and asset sales should be openly marketed and he furthermore pointed out that NAMA did not favour granting exclusive access to any potential purchaser as that would militate against achieving optimal value for the assets concerned.  I understand that the Department of Finance proposes to circulate copies of the Minister&rsquo;s correspondence with Mr. Wilson.<br\/><br\/>In September 2013, Brown Rudnick made an unsolicited approach to NAMA and indicated that one of its clients, PIMCO, was interested in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In its subsequent engagement with NAMA, PIMCO indicated a preference for a closed transaction, which did not involve open marketing of the portfolio.  The board agreed that senior NAMA staff should engage further with PIMCO but with a view ultimately to completing an openly marketed loan sale in line with board policy.  On 4 December 2013, PIMCO submitted a bid expressed in terms of a price range with the final price to be determined after due diligence.  PIMCO indicated that its preference remained that the sale would be a closed transaction.<br\/><br\/>At a meeting on 12 December 2013, the NAMA board decided that the portfolio should be openly marketed as part of a competitive process; the board also set a minimum price below which it would not be willing to proceed with a sale.  This minimum price reflected NAMA's valuation of the underlying assets.  At a further meeting on 8 January 2014, the board approved the appointment of Lazard to advise NAMA on the appropriate marketing approach and to oversee the sales process.  It was envisaged that this would involve marketing to suitable targeted bidders who would have the financial wherewithal to submit credible bids on the portfolio.  On 17 January 2014, NAMA received from the principal private secretary to the Northern Ireland First Minister a copy of a &quot;letter of intent&quot; relating to the proposed management of the Northern Ireland portfolio.  The letter appeared to summarise an agreement between PIMCO and the Northern Ireland Executive and its purpose was to require the purchaser of the portfolio to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the government of Northern Ireland, confirming certain fundamental conditions relating to the future management of the portfolio.  NAMA did not engage further in regard to the draft letter.  I understand the draft letter of intent is also being released today.<br\/><br\/>On 10 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that its compliance staff had discovered that PIMCO&rsquo;s proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included also the payment of fees to Tughans, a Belfast law firm, and to a former external member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee.  PIMCO named that individual as Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Our understanding was that PIMCO and Brown Rudnick had been engaging since September 2013, and possibly earlier, but it appears that its compliance staff only became aware of the &quot;fee-sharing&quot; arrangement in early March 2014.  It is not clear to us whether this late discovery arose because of internal communications issues within PIMCO or between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick.<br\/><br\/>A special meeting of the NAMA board was convened on 11 March 2014, the following day.  The board viewed PIMCO's disclosure as a very serious development and it considered the most appropriate course of action.  Whereas the former Northern Ireland advisory committee member was no longer a member of the committee at the time of the disclosure - he had resigned on 8 November 2013 - and never had access to confidential information, the board considered that the proposed fee arrangement could undermine the integrity of the sales process.  The board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process.  On 12 March 2014, NAMA indicated its serious concerns to PIMCO about the proposed fee arrangement to the former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  On 13 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that it would withdraw from the Project Eagle process.  I understand that in recent days PIMCO has disputed the facts as outlined above and suggested that its withdrawal from the sales process was voluntary.  I do not propose to enter into a debate with PIMCO as to the meaning of the word &quot;voluntary&quot;.  Suffice it to say that it was left in no doubt that if the withdrawal was not voluntary, it would have to be involuntary.<br\/><br\/>Lazard engaged with a total of nine potential purchasers, including PIMCO, during the first quarter of 2014 and, at the end of the process, the best bid from the two remaining bidders was received from Cerberus.  I say in response to some insinuation in the past few days that the other remaining bid was not from PIMCO.  The Cerberus bid was accepted by the board on 3 April and announced on 4 April 2014.  The transaction was completed in June 2014.<br\/><br\/>For the avoidance of doubt, no fee payment was made by NAMA to Brown Rudnick.  NAMA had very limited engagement with Tughans on this sale and did not instruct Tughans to advise it on any aspect of the sale.  Fees totalling &euro;7,839 were paid to Tughans as payment for delivery of title documents and assistance with due diligence queries.  NAMA's legal adviser on Project Eagle was Hogan Lovells.<br\/><br\/>Cerberus has stated that it made a fee payment to Brown Rudnick and that Brown Rudnick advised that the fee would be shared with Tughans.  Cerberus state that this was payment for strategic advice relating to the sales process and for work that Brown Rudnick and Tughans had already carried out on the portfolio.  From NAMA's perspective, there would have been no reason to question why a purchaser of a loan portfolio would have been making payments to two law firms.  What did concern us, based on PIMCO's disclosure, was the possibility that a payment would have been made to a former member of the Norther Ireland advisory committee.  We sought and received written confirmation from Cerberus at the time that no fees were paid to any party with a connection to NAMA.  Cerberus confirmed the position as follows:<blockquote>We confirm that no fee, commission or other remuneration or payment is payable to any current or former member of the board of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), any current or former member of the executive of NAMA or any current or former member of an advisory committee of NAMA in connection with any aspect of our participation in the Project Eagle sales process. <\/blockquote>I am confident that the NAMA board acted quickly and decisively and took every measure available to it to protect the integrity of the sales process as soon as the proposed fee arrangement came to light.<br\/><br\/>Tughans, in its recent statement, indicated &quot;that a former partner diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners&quot;.  Tughans also confirmed that the individual in question no longer works for the firm and that the company has &quot;reported the circumstances of the departure of the former partner to the Law Society&quot;.  These disclosures by Tughans are a matter for that company and they had no impact on the competitive sales process run on behalf of NAMA.  If there are suggestions that there was wrongdoing by certain parties, it is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities to investigate them.  Given the facts as outlined above, it would be entirely wrong and dishonest to conflate NAMA's process with the unrelated Tughans issue.<br\/><br\/>I will outline the role played by the Northern Ireland advisory committee with regard to NAMA's activities in Northern Ireland.  NAMA has four statutory committees &ndash; the audit committee, the credit committee, the finance and operating committee and the risk management committee - established under section 32 of the NAMA Act.  Section 33 of the Act provides that the board may establish such advisory committees as it considers necessary or desirable to advise it in the performance of its functions.<\/p><p>The NAMA board established two such committees, the planning advisory committee and the Northern Ireland advisory committee, the NIAC.  The latter was established in 2010 at the suggestion of the late Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan.  The Minister felt the committee would be useful in advising the board on the strategy for Northern Ireland assets.  Following consultation with the Minister, who in turn I understand had consulted the Northern Ireland Executive, the NAMA board decided in May 2010 to appoint Mr. Brian Rowntree and Mr. Frank Cushnahan to the NIAC.  From 2010 to 2011, the NIAC was chaired by Mr. Peter Stewart, who was a member of the board of NAMA.  After Mr. Stewart's resignation from the board and from the NIAC in October 2011, I became chairman of the committee until its dissolution in September 2014.<\/p><p> I would like to clarify a few points regarding the role of the NIAC.  Its role was to advise on the broad economic and social context in Northern Ireland in which NAMA was operating and on the overall state of the property market.  The NIAC had no role in relation to NAMA debtors or the assets securing their loans.  No discussion of particular debtors or particular assets was permitted at NIAC meetings.  No specific information relating to debtors or assets was ever provided to external members of the NIAC and the NIAC had no decision-making powers.  I am aware a former member of the NIAC, Mr. Brian Rowntree, has said in recent days that the NIAC was \"kept in the dark\" about the Project Eagle transaction.  I agree.  While the committee was informed at its meeting on 7 October 2013 that PIMCO had made an unsolicited approach to purchase the portfolio, it was made clear that key information and decisions relating to the portfolio were matters for the board of NAMA only.  For the avoidance of any doubt, therefore, it is important to point out that external members of the NIAC did not have access to any information about the portfolio that would have been of value to a potential bidder.  The board took the view for reasons that Mr. Brendan McDonagh will outline later that the best commercial option was to sell the portfolio on the basis that there was a limited prospect over a medium-term horizon of a significant improvement in values.<\/p><p> The sale of the Project Eagle portfolio received a broad welcome when it was first announced.  The extent to which the sale has acted and may continue to act as a catalyst to stimulate activity in the Northern Ireland property market and in the economy more generally is to be welcomed.  I am confident that the transaction will ultimately be seen as benefiting Northern Ireland and the taxpayers in the Republic.  We have no difficulty in discussing NAMA's commercial rationale for the sale.  All documents and records relating to the sale of Project Eagle were available to the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of his audit of the 2014 financial statements.  We are aware that, as required by the NAMA Act, he is planning to initiate his second section 226 triennial review of NAMA, covering the 2012-15 period, over the coming months.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed this plan this morning.  He has also confirmed my assumption that this transaction will be one of those assessed as part of that review.  On behalf of NAMA, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's forthcoming review.  I am confident it will show that we have acted commercially and properly.  Regardless of the commercial aspects of this sale, we take great exception to any suggestion that anyone representing NAMA - a current or former board member, or a current or former member of staff - was engaged in wrongdoing.  I reiterate that if there has been wrongdoing at the periphery of this transaction in Northern Ireland, it has nothing to do with NAMA.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is wrong and dishonest to claim otherwise.<\/p><p> I have read my statement as it was submitted to the committee.  Before I conclude, I wish to make three short points about the coverage of this issue over the past 24 hours.  First, there is no PSNI investigation of the sale of these loans by NAMA.  The PSNI is investigating activities relating to the purchase of these assets, rather than their sale.  That is a critical distinction.  Second, there is no truth in the suggestion that &euro;7 million of the sales proceeds of this transaction ended up in an Isle of Man account.  NAMA received the full proceeds from this sale.  The origin of that &euro;7 million is not NAMA.  There has been no suggestion that NAMA is the origin.  Many media outlets are continuing to make this error.  Third, it has been mistakenly claimed in the media that NAMA sold assets that were valued or worth approximately &euro;5 billion for approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  Again, this is simply wrong.  It is a very serious error.  NAMA sold the assets for exactly what they were worth and not a cent less.  The assets may or may not have been worth more years earlier.

The board approved the sale because it took the view in early 2014 that it represented the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking a range of factors into account.  The key point about the Eagle portfolio is the fact that five Irish banks advanced &pound;4.5 billion to Northern Ireland-based debtors for property which subsequently lost over two thirds of its value.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the Northern Ireland asset mix securing NAMA loans, we estimate that prices fell by over 50% from peak to the end of 2013.  Lending by Irish banks to Northern Ireland debtors appears to have been particularly risky.  Some 44% of the assets by number in the Eagle portfolio were land and development properties which were severely affected by the collapse in commercial and residential prices.  Another 26% by number were residential assets.  There was also a heavy concentration of lending secured by assets in regional UK which did not benefit from the strong recovery experienced in London after 2009.  That element of the decline in asset values in Northern Ireland and regional locations in Britain which happened prior to November 2009 was reflected in the discounts applied when NAMA acquired the portfolio from the banks.  The further decline in prices which took place after 2009, however, had to be absorbed by NAMA and, as was prudent, it took appropriate impairment provisions against the loans of Northern Ireland debtor connections which were fully reflected in each year&rsquo;s audited financial statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with international financial reporting standards, NAMA must recognise impairment in its financial statements, to the extent that it arises, in each accounting period.  Cumulatively, the write-down against Northern Ireland debtor connections totalled &euro;800 million between 2010 and 2014 and would mainly have reflected falling collateral values.  The provisions were included in successive financial statements from 2010 onwards.  They included a closing write-down of over &euro;200 million which was recognised in the 2014 financial statements.  Clearly, it was fully understood by the NAMA board and the executive that the impairment taken on this portfolio, while substantial, reflected poor lending decisions by the Irish banks in advancing &pound;4.5 billion for the purchase of assets which were generally of mediocre or poor quality and which were seriously affected by the economic downturn primarily in Northern Ireland and regional UK.<\/p> <p>  In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman&rsquo;s terms, on the Northern Ireland portfolio was about &euro;280 million.  In January 2014 the board approved the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio by reference to a minimum sale price of &pound;1.3 billion.  This reflected our valuation of the underlying assets.  For a range of reasons which I will outline, the board&rsquo;s view was that NAMA could struggle to achieve this amount if we were to manage the loans over a seven-year period to 2020, bearing in mind the size of the Northern Ireland economy.  The minimum sale price was adjusted to &pound;1.24 billion by early April 2014 to reflect asset disposals which had taken place in the intervening period between the launch of the loan sale and the closing.  The associated cash proceeds from these sales, however, were received by NAMA.<\/p> <p>  Lazard, appointed by NAMA in January 2014 to oversee and advise it on the loan sale, confirmed to the board that the sales and marketing process was appropriate, given the nature and scale of the transaction and given NAMA&rsquo;s objective of maximising the recovery to Irish taxpayers.  Lazard also stated in a closing transaction letter to the board that &ldquo;sufficient competitive tension remained in the process&rdquo; following the withdrawal of PIMCO and, having reviewed the remaining two bids, it recommended moving forward solely with Cerberus with a view to executing the loan sale agreement on agreed terms and at the agreed price.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rationale for the sale, there were a number of reasons the board took the view that the sale of the portfolio represented the best commercial option for NAMA.  From 2010 to 2013, there had been relatively few sales of properties in the Northern Ireland portfolio and there had been little or no investor interest in acquiring either Northern Ireland assets or the associated loans.  The total volume of investment activity in Northern Ireland is estimated only to have been &euro;75 million in 2012 and &euro;175 million in 2013.  Absorption capacity was a key strategic concern of the NAMA board, given that over 50% of the portfolio was based in Northern Ireland.  The asset portfolio securing NAMA loans was very granular and had few major assets which might have been of interest to purchasers if we had decided to proceed to sell the assets on an asset by asset basis.  That granularity is illustrated by the fact that, as of November 2013, only 2% of the properties had an acquisition value in excess of &pound;20 million and many of these were in regional locations in the United Kingdom.  Some 81% of the properties by number had an acquisition value of less than &pound;2 million.  Some 70% of the properties by number were categorised either as residential or land and development assets and the average acquisition value per asset in this group was about &pound;800,000.<\/p> <p>  The appendix to the paper provides a breakdown by value of the portfolio as it was at the point of sale.  As mentioned, most of the assets securing the portfolio declined substantially in value between our reference acquisition date in November 2009 and late 2013.  It was clear that realising even the carrying value of a portfolio secured by so many small assets was going to be a long and difficult process.  The medium-term outlook for the Northern Ireland economy was uncertain and it was clear to us, even if there was to be a sustained recovery in the years ahead, that the assets securing our loans would have been slow to benefit from such a recovery.  In other words, in the event of a sustained recovery, the larger commercial income producing assets would be the first to gain and that it would be some time before the impact of recovery would percolate down to smaller assets.  The Project Eagle portfolio included 36 smaller debtor connections that were managed by NAMA&rsquo;s participating institutions.  Many of these connections had little or no property management platform or capability and it was likely, in the board&rsquo;s view, that the work-out process would be protracted and costly and that there was no certainty that it would have yielded a superior commercial outcome to the loan sale.  A loan sale would eliminate the risks, uncertainties and costs associated with a protracted work-out of the Northern Ireland portfolio which had limited capacity to appreciate in value over a medium-term horizon.<\/p> <p>  The board and the executive also considered the impact of a potential Eagle sale on our ability to manage the rest of our portfolio.  From a risk management perspective, the sale of the Eagle portfolio would help to de-risk the overall portfolio by removing a heavy concentration of assets in markets with significant liquidity challenges and where recovery was likely to lag behind other major markets.  It would also free up our resources to focus more on the portfolio of assets in the Republic of Ireland and London where, in our view, asset management work and effort would yield better results.<\/p> <p>  For all these reasons, we made a decision that the best return we could generate from the portfolio would be from a loan sale.  This assumed that we could achieve a price that matched our expectations as to what the portfolio should realise, based on the information available to us.  As a commercial entity, decisions to sell or hold assets are ones we are required to make all the time.  All of our decisions are based on the best available information at the time a decision is taken.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the loan sales process in general adopted by NAMA, the key consideration for NAMA in any loan sale process is that all interested parties are given the opportunity to bid and that all bidders are treated equally and fairly.  We insist on the open marketing of loans through experienced loan sales advisers.  We set clear ground rules at the start of each loan sale.  Everybody knows the rules.  We ensure all bidders are given access to the same information at the same time, including all loan agreements, security and title information, data tapes, lease information and tenancy schedules.  We evaluate all bids on the same basis.  We execute our loan sales to best practice international standards.  This is recognised in the global loan sales market where NAMA enjoys a strong reputation for the quality of information provided in our data rooms and for the transparent and the professional manner in which all loan sale transactions have been completed to date.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, I reiterate a number of important points.  The commercial decision taken by the NAMA board to dispose of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio was the correct one.  The board took the view that this option would provide the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking into account the quality of assets in the portfolio, the lack of liquidity in the Northern Ireland property market, the availability of a number of investors to bid competitively on the size of the portfolio and NAMA&rsquo;s need to focus on its assets in the Republic of Ireland and London, which were more likely to benefit from intensive asset management attention.  The sale was conducted in line with best international practice and all bidders had access to the same detailed information on the portfolio.  We took care at all stages to ensure the integrity of the sales process was fully protected and the NAMA board acted quickly and decisively as soon as the proposed fee arrangement to a former NIAC member came to light.<\/p> <p>  Lazard advised on and recommended the outcome of the Eagle sales process to the board.  I am satisfied, from a commercial perspective, that the transaction would stand up to rigorous scrutiny by any independent assessor.  I am also satisfied that there has been no wrongdoing on the part of any current or former member of the NAMA board or NAMA staff.  It is entirely unfair that there has been an attempt to besmirch NAMA&rsquo;s reputation on the basis of the alleged behaviour of certain individuals in Northern Ireland who were at the periphery of the transaction and advising potential purchasers, not NAMA.<\/p> <p>  I thank members for their attention.

Our problem always was with the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee member or what was reported to us in relation to that NIAC member.  I suppose we were concerned enough.  It was really more a case of \"to be sure, to be sure\" that when it came to our attention that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were involved with Cerberus, we went back to Cerberus before its bid was considered or accepted and asked for an undertaking in relation to fees, which I outlined in my statement.  As it is in my statement, I will not read it again.  However, Cerberus gave us an unequivocal statement in writing to the fact that no fees were paid to any party with any connection to NAMA.  That was really the issue for us, namely, that fees to any party with any connection to NAMA.  Cerberus provided a very broad confirmation in relation to any board member, executive member or current or former member of the advisory committee.<\/p> <p>  While that may seem to be a very broad statement, our real target was to know whether there was any fee that in any way might be payable to Mr. Cushnahan at that time.

At the time, the Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, came up with a neat solution that NAMA would be asked to form an advisory committee on Northern Ireland which would have a couple of representatives from Northern Ireland on it.  As I understand it, the selection process was that the Minister or Department consulted the Northern Ireland Executive, in particular, Sammy Wilson, who was then the Minister for Finance and Personnel.  The two names of Frank Cushnahan and Brian Rowntree were furnished to NAMA as a consequence of that consultation and the NAMA board then set up the committee and appointed these two individuals to it, together with several directors of the NAMA board because the Act requires that the majority of members of an advisory committee like the Northern Ireland committee or the planning committee be members of the board of NAMA.

It was a very small business community - I am sure that a lot of information is shared and a lot of information would be known.  NAMA had someone on the Northern Ireland advisory committee, which was well known and well placed within that jurisdiction.  They also had two firms - Tughans, the local firm, and Brown and Rudnick.  In January 2014, there was a suggestion in terms of the memorandum of understanding.  I know that no one acted on it, that it was not from NAMA, that it was just a piece of paper that went to NAMA.  Bearing in mind the size of the economy and the 55 debtors, I would imagine there was a lot known about everyone within that community and their indebtedness and so on.  The Northern Ireland Executive, or someone from it, suggested this MOU and, without a shadow of a doubt, it protects the debtors and it is the best offer I have seen for debtors in which, for nil payment, they were released.  That is being suggested on one side and we cannot ignore it because there is something going on up here that is unusual and it is certainly unusual that someone of that standing within Northern Ireland would suggest it.  Then there is the involvement of the two firms.  Now, in the correspondence that NAMA has given us this morning, the Brown and Rudnick correspondence of 24 June 2013, the letter from Brown and Rudnick to Mr. Wilson, which is marked \"highly confidential\", it states: \"Two of our clients have each confirmed that they would, independently, be committed to a process of potential outright purchase of the NAMA Northern Irish Borrower Connections Loan Book.\"<\/p><p>At that stage, in June 2013, Brown Rudnick was indicating clearly there were two clients.  They had two clients, but thereafter, when PIMCO withdrew in March 2014, it appears the information on the &pound;15 million became clear to you. <\/p><p> To go back to the point made by Deputy Ross, it seems to me it is quite possible a company was used as a stalking horse and that then the final bidder was there to come in to make the final bid and close the deal.  It seems the information was certainly being shared all around the place with connections in Northern Ireland and that not only was this deal compromised, but there was even an extension of the deal that would accommodate debtors.  I must agree that bearing all of this in mind, the intelligence from the front up there would surely have told you there was something odd, to say the least, about the deal and that something should have been done by NAMA to restructure the process and its approach to that deal.  Perhaps the decision made on that restructuring would have been not to sell in a single property portfolio but to break it down to attract a wider range of bidders.  NAMA should at least have reported to someone the information that was in the public domain from 2013.<\/p><p> It appears to me that somebody was setting up the purchase.  That is what comes across in the correspondence and in the confidential MOU and it is what seems to come across in the context of the use of Brown Rudnick and Tughans and the involvement of the individual you have just mentioned.  What does NAMA have to say to that, even in the context of the perception.  Can you deal with it that way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#K04300","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>It is not unusual that firms such as Brown Rudnick would go out and seek deals and try to get in a position to be able to promote that deal to third parties and get a fee.  That happens quite regularly.  Therefore, when Brown Rudnick went out and tried to \"source the deal\", its fee was only going to be paid if the portfolio was sold.  From our point of view, we want to sell the portfolio for the best price we can get for it.  We were very clear from the outset that we wanted &pound;1.3 billion for the portfolio, as that is what we valued the underlying portfolio at, and we got &pound;1.3 billion for it.<\/p> <p>  A large portfolio can be broken into small or large parts, but as I outlined in my statement today, this was a very granular, quite poor portfolio in that there was a large number of small value assets, over 50% of it in Northern Ireland and 33% of it in regional United Kingdom areas.  We would be a long time working through that portfolio trying to realise each individual asset, because there is not huge demand for granular portfolios like that.  As can be seen from the case of other banks that are selling granular portfolios, there is a certain type of private equity buyer who buys that sort of portfolio.  PIMCO, obviously, expressed an interest in the portfolio, Cerberus expressed an interest in it and Fortress expressed an interest in it.  They are the type of buyers who buy these granular portfolios.  <\/p> <p>  Therefore, for such a big deal ticket or big cheque, of &pound;1.3 billion, there are not too many people out there who can do that who are interested in this type of portfolio.  We researched this and discussed it with our loan supervisor, Lazard.  We are satisfied there was competitive tension up to the very end of the process.  This is a big portfolio.  We did everything right.  We did not accommodate any interference or involvement of Mr. Cushnahan.  We sought confirmations from Cerberus and it has confirmed to the media that it sought confirmations from both Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  It is not unusual that companies like Brown Rudnick would go around the place, in terms of people or companies that would approach NAMA or other financial institutions, saying they might have somebody who would be interested in a portfolio and asking whether we had a portfolio that had these characteristics coming to the market. <\/p> <p>  From our point of view, we must make sure we run a fair process.  We ran a very fair process, with a data room which controlled access to the data, controlled information in that data room, with information provided at the same time to all bidders.  We achieved the price we aimed for in January 2014 when the deal closed in April 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Does Mr. McDonagh feel NAMA might have been set up in any way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#L00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>This information was out there and these firms were out there.

However, when we piece together the correspondence NAMA provided to us this morning, the memorandum of understanding, the fact there were 55 debtors and that it is a small market, this would seem to me to have been the wrong approach, based on the information NAMA gleaned as it went through the process.<\/p> <p>  On 10 March 2014, when it became known to NAMA that this &pound;15 million was to be split three ways, according to PIMCO, surely this should have set alarm bells ringing.  There were other instances that should have set alarm bells ringing before that - going back to 2014 in that letter, going back to Mr. Cushnahan and his termination or resignation from the council and other issues I will come to later.  In my opinion, this should have been a huge concern for NAMA at the time and it should have stood back and questioned the process again.  That is the point I am making.  <\/p> <p>  In response to my questions, NAMA is outlining the involvement of Brown Rudnick, but I am going beyond that to the knowledge in the local economy and among debtors, the knowledge between Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan and the other interests that were there.

Let us be clear about what was running through the Brown Rudnick-PIMCO approach - \"We want a closed sale.  We do not want you to put it on the market.\"  We took a very strong view from day one that it did not matter what PIMCO or anybody else wanted, this was going to be an open sale.  We looked at the approach from PIMCO and, as we would with any other approach for a portfolio, asked if this was a possibility and an opportunity for a portfolio that we regarded as really challenging and troubled and that we figured we would still be struggling to dispose of in 2020.  We received an approach and the price was something that interested us, but we were not sure whether it was the right one.  We said we would look at it, engage with PIMCO to see what it might be offering, make our own analysis of the portfolio, decide our minimum reserve price and openly market the portfolio, which is what we did right through the process.<\/p> <p>  There was political interest.  It would be naive of me to come here and say there was not.  Of course, there was.  There has always been a strong political interest in the North-South dimension here.  There was political interest, but I can tell the Deputy that whatever the interest was, North or South, it never influenced us in the decision to put the portfolio on the market in the first place - that was based purely on our commercial assessment that this could represent a good outcome for the taxpayer - nor was there - I need to say this, notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy is not suggesting it - any interference, pressure or anything else in relation to the decision in the end to accept the highest and winning bid from Cerberus.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the confidential memorandum, I do not know what it is.

NAMA was selling groups of assets, or groups of loans, at a particular value, and all of a sudden the Northern Ireland portfolio, a sale that is three times bigger in terms of book value, is put all in one.  It is an enormous jump.  People have difficulty - I have difficulty with how NAMA put the whole thing in one.  It had not done anything like this, of this scale, in any other region.<\/p> <p>  Normally, when an organisation comes before the committee, figures are quoted by its representatives and by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and they tend to be fairly similar.  I have never seen a conflict like that between the figures presented in Mr. McCarthy's opening statement and those the witnesses read out to us.  If anything is to be achieved by this committee, we must resolve this conflict satisfactorily.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General started off by saying that we all know the book value of these loans was &euro;57 billion.  NAMA took them in at &euro;2.2 billion.  Is that correct?  It was a discount of over 60%.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures, &euro;2.2 billion was the carrying value when NAMA came in.  In his opening statement, Mr. McCarthy said that the proceeds were about &euro;1.4 billion and there was a loss in NAMA's handling this portfolio of approximately &euro;800 million.  He said &euro;211 million of it was made up on the loss at the time of the sale and &euro;572 million with previous provisions NAMA had made against this.  The actual loss by NAMA on the discounted value it took in, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General - his figures are up on the screen - was &euro;783 million.  He started at the &euro;5.7 billion, where I started.  Without getting into a big debate, because my time is tight, am I not right?  That is the figure he gave.<\/p> <p>  However, Mr. McDonagh then tells me - I am quoting from his opening statement - \"In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman&rsquo;s terms, on the NI debtor portfolio was about &euro;280 million.\"  That was NAMA's loss at the point of sale.  Mr. McDonagh will have to clarify that statement, and both of those figures are going to have to be reconciled.  How can the Comptroller and Auditor General say that NAMA lost &euro;783 million on this portfolio in its time, while Mr. McDonagh can come in and say that in layman's terms - whatever that means - it was &euro;280 million?

Mr. Daly gave reasons as to why he felt it was probably the right thing to do when it came to the disposal of this loan book.  Considering the resources in NAMA, it would make it easier to deal with other things and other properties as a result.

Mr. Daly spoke about getting rid of this loan book in a lagging market.  He felt NAMA would get the best price for this entire loan book at that time.  Everything is very easy in hindsight and everyone is an expert when it comes to property values after the fact.  Everyone is an expert in this country these days.

Commercial values in Dublin at that time were going way up as well.  That was the firm opinion back then when the board made the decision to dispose of this loan book.  I suppose I am second guessing whether or not NAMA should have sat on this.  I do not have the values.

One certainly cannot do that by sitting on every asset one has and hoping that in ten years the market will have begun to move without any intervention from NAMA.  NAMA's sales in the market are in themselves a stimulant.  I believe that the entry of a huge fund like Cerberus into the Northern Ireland market has probably created a stimulus.  It is very hard to take that into account when back in April 2014, NAMA made that decision.  We can debate this wherever the Deputy likes but to say the market had turned might be a bit strong.

All of that is outside NAMA.  All of that related to the purchasing side of this and certainly not the selling side, so I have been disturbed by the way that has been conflated.  As I said at the beginning of this meeting, wherever that &pound;7 million came from, it did not come from NAMA and it did not come, in any way, from the proceeds of this sale that should have been due to NAMA.  I am firmly of that view.<\/p> <p>  If a firm of solicitors in Northern Ireland suddenly finds that a fee - a very substantial fee in this case - has apparently been diverted to an account in the name of one individual from that firm and the fact that it managed to get it back seems to indicate that it was not right in the first place, it should be investigated by the Law Society of Northern Ireland in respect of the individual and presumably the firm of solicitors.  The PSNI indicated yesterday that it will look at that.<\/p><p>NAMA certainly welcomes that, but NAMA is very firmly of the view that this transaction did not relate to NAMA or certainly no source of funding or anything like that related to NAMA.

That is all on the record.<\/p> <p>  NAMA has been controversial since the beginning and once the name \"NAMA\" appears anywhere in connection with a story, it gets the headlines.  One of the most effective ways of dealing with very controversial issues for us in the past has been with this committee.  Coming in is not always comfortable but that is what we are doing today.  I can understand the public might be exercised about NAMA's sales process and whether it got value for money.  We have explained the process in absolute detail.  We have said why we think we got value for money and that we got the right price.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is now going to look at that aspect of it in his triennial review.  It goes without saying that every document and piece of analysis will be made available to him.  That is all we can do.  The conflation in recent days and weeks about this payment in Northern Ireland from a company based in Northern Ireland to an individual in Northern Ireland is not something of which NAMA has any knowledge and with which it has any involvement.

Is Mr. Daly concerned, given what I have outlined to him, that a meeting such as the one I described had happened between Cerberus and senior political figures just days in advance of the final NAMA decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04000","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>To be clear and to correct myself slightly, I am reminded that we did have a courtesy call with John Snow in March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>On what date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I do not know the date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":721,"content":"<p>The date might be important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":722,"content":"<p>We can certainly get the date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#W04600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>It was a courtesy call, which quite often happens.

If there was wrongdoing, it should be identified, uncovered and explained.  When one has the Isle of Man and the numbers of companies involved, and when it is explained as it was explained to this committee, the story worsens.  The plot thickens and we have not come to the end of it.  PIMCO disclosed the &pound;15 million to NAMA and one has to ask how a firm the size of PIMCO cannot miss the &pound;7 million.  It is not answered and it cannot be answered here.  We owe it to the political system and the administration to get to the end of this.  It is disturbing for the memorandum of understanding to appear and for it not to have official backing in terms of its origins.  It is disturbing also that it was suggested that there would be a nil balance for the 55 debtors.  Who did this benefit and what was it about? Where is the &pound;7 million and where is it going to go now?  These are the questions that must be answered.<\/p> <p>  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General will do an investigation into this and it might shine more light on the processes and procedures within NAMA itself.  It may benefit NAMA and our understanding of what went on.  This is an unfinished piece of work that can only be concluded by some agency straddling both jurisdictions to bring it to a head.  I understand the difficulties for NAMA personnel appearing before the committee in Northern Ireland, and the witnesses present said that they would not appear.  The PSNI might expedite a thorough investigation which, depending on the outcome, could be dealt with more appropriately at a committee and the information could be put out there.  It is striking, Mr. Reid, that the committee got the release of these letters and the memorandum of understanding this morning.  Alarm bells should have been ringing loud and clear a long time ago once you had sight of the letters and the correspondence.

Essentially, it arises from a change in the pension arrangements in respect of those five universities as a result of the 2009 Act where an existing pension fund into which the universities were contributing was transferred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, the Higher Educational Authority, HEA, continued to fund them as if they were still contributing and they were instructed to pay the surplus funds into individual pension fund accounts.  They are recorded in the individual universities but they will be there in the future to meet liabilities that otherwise would fall on the HEA.

This committee received a large volume of correspondence over an extended period setting out a range of complaints and allegations about the operations of County Cork VEC, some with reference to incidents dating back to 2000.  These included allegations about the operation of the Youthreach programme in Macroom and a range of legal disputes between the VEC and its employees.  The audit of the financial statements of County Cork VEC for the 2011 and 2012 years of account were extended to examine the various alleged control weaknesses and financial losses.  The focus of the additional work was primarily on establishing whether any of the alleged control weaknesses were evident in the operation of County Cork VEC in 2011 and 2012 and, if so, whether the VEC had suffered financial losses as a result.<\/p> <p>  Youthreach is a national programme of second chance education and training directed primarily at unemployed early school leavers aged 15 to 20.  County Cork VEC operated seven Youthreach centres.  One of the centres, Macroom Youthreach, had an approved allocation for 30 students.  While the Department of Education and Skills had specified eligibility criteria for Youthreach applicants, local co-ordinators had discretion to allow individuals who did not satisfy the normal criteria to participate in the programme.  In such cases, the applicants&rsquo; files should clearly document the reason for their inclusion on the programme. <\/p> <p>  Between 2007 and 2012, payments totalling &euro;114,000 were made to eight students participating in Macroom Youthreach who were subsequently deemed by the VEC to have been ineligible.  Examination of the files of the eight students found a lack of documentary evidence for the reasons for their inclusion on the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#GG03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":878,"content":"<p>Although there were some residual control weaknesses and one case where a student continued on Youthreach until determined to be ineligible in 2012, we found that the controls over assessment of eligibility had generally operated as intended at Macroom Youthreach centre in the academic year 2011-2012.  We found no evidence of the weaknesses that had occurred in Macroom being replicated at other Youthreach centres, when further samples of files were examined as part of the audit of County Cork VEC or other VECs.  Nevertheless, I have recommended that the Department should review its guidelines in relation to Youthreach to clarify the limits of discretion available to co-ordinators to admit students to the programme on an exceptional basis, and how such exercise of discretion should be documented.<br\/><br\/>An internal audit report by the Vocational Support Services Unit, VSSU, completed in August 2010 identified a number of weaknesses regarding payments to staff at the Macroom Youthreach centre.  It was estimated that the VEC paid for 1,070 tuition hours in the academic year 2009-2010, estimated to cost &euro;60,000, where teachers were not timetabled to teach.  The VEC had also paid part-time teachers for an additional 500 non-teaching hours used for administrative work associated with the centre at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;25,000 for the academic year 2009-10.  Payments were made to two part-time staff without deduction of PAYE and PRSI.  In addition, it appeared that two individuals in receipt of a student allowance were not attending training but were in fact employed to provide English language tuition.  The audit of County Cork VEC's financial statements for 2011 and 2012 examined payments to staff, including in Macroom Youthreach, and no continuing issues of concern were noted.<br\/><br\/>The Vocational Educational Act 1930 requires a VEC to obtain sanction from the Minister prior to entering a lease.  In 2012, an internal audit in the VEC raised concerns about two leases entered into without obtaining the required sanction and recommended that the VEC conduct a review.  This identified six further leases where sanction had not been obtained as required.  The position in relation to seven leased buildings has now been regularised by way of retrospective sanction granted by the Department between November 2012 and May 2014.<br\/><br\/>One of the unsanctioned leases related to a 15-year lease agreement for a building in Mallow entered into in 1996, with an option to purchase the building in 2011, at the end of the lease, for a nominal sum.  When it was applying for grant funding of &euro;1 million towards the construction cost of a cr&egrave;che in the building in 2008, the VEC entered into a revised lease agreement.  Grants for cr&egrave;che facilities would not have been payable for investment in a building on a short lease.  As a result, the term of the lease was extended to 2031, and the VEC became legally committed to additional lease payments of &euro;431,700 as a result.  Subsequently, further revised arrangements provided for the cessation of lease payments with effect from 1 January 2012 and the transfer of ownership of the building for a nominal sum, as provided for in the original lease.  This removed the obligation on the VEC to make the extended lease payments.<br\/><br\/>In 2010, the VEC also entered into a 99-year lease, committing itself to costs of &euro;20,000 a year over the term of the lease in the form of four annual scholarships.  In return, the VEC secured the use of a site with an area of 0.9 ha adjacent to a marine outdoor education centre in Schull.  No analysis was undertaken to compare the projected cost of the scholarships with the likely benefits.  The lease arrangement was terminated in August 2013 by mutual agreement with the land owner.  The incurred cost of the scholarships amounted to a total of &euro;40,000, and the VEC had the use of the site for four years.<br\/><br\/>A number of other issues were also identified in relation to County Cork VEC.  Between 2010 and 2013, legal settlements amounting to &euro;111,600 were made by the VEC from its own funds.  The VEC&rsquo;s insurers made further settlements, amounting to &euro;95,000, in respect of 23 cases and incurred legal costs of &euro;120,000.  In addition, legal costs incurred by the VEC amounted to &euro;442,200 for the four years 2010 to 2013, significantly above the VEC sector average.  A further case was settled by the ETB in 2014 and included compensation of &euro;10,000 and arrears of salary for 11 years amounting to &euro;168,000.<br\/><br\/>In 2002, the VEC accepted a gift of a boat called the <i>Omar B<\/i>and used it as part of a sailing training programme.  The boat has been in dry dock storage since 2007, at a total cost of &euro;10,700.<br\/><br\/>The VEC had a long-standing arrangement with a voluntary body providing services to people with disability whereby the VEC provided funding in lieu of teaching hours.  The arrangement was in breach of departmental guidelines in relation to the operation of such arrangements.  The funding provided was based on a specified number of training hours using VEC pay rates for an unqualified part-time teacher whereas the actual pay rates in operation in the voluntary organisation were significantly lower.  The grant to the voluntary body in 2011 was just under &euro;93,500.  The Vocational Support Services Unit, VSSU, estimated that, if funding had been provided based on the cost of the teaching delivered, as required by the Department&rsquo;s guidelines, the grant would have been lower by &euro;49,000.<br\/><br\/>Finally, a tax audit of County Cork VEC by the Revenue Commissioners resulted in a settlement of &euro;115,700 in June 2013.  The settlement included a number of tax categories and related to tax periods as far back as 2003.<br\/><br\/>Some of the control issues outlined in correspondence about County Cork VEC were present in 2011 and 2012, while other matters had been corrected.  The ETB has since taken action to regularise transactions or to terminate arrangements in order to address the remaining issues.  The audit of the final financial statement of the VEC for the period to end June 2013 has been completed and no significant ongoing control lapses were identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#HH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make this opening statement concerning the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on internal control in County Cork VEC.  The education and training board sector has undergone unprecedented change in recent years.  In 2013, the Education and Training Boards Act established 16 ETBs and the 33 vocational education committees were dissolved.  As well as the establishment of the ETBs, major changes have also taken place in the co-ordination and funding of further education and training with the establishment of SOLAS in October 2013.  Change is ongoing and will take a number of years to embed.  The new ETBs continue to develop as single entities, adapting organisational structures and practices accordingly and developing their response to their new responsibility for training.  While County Cork VEC has been dissolved, its functions were transferred to Cork ETB from 1 July 2013.<\/p> <p>  The Department welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on internal control in County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  The report sets out what happened in relation to a number of failures of internal control and failures to follow proper procedures.  The report also indicates that various concerns are either not apparent on examination of more recent accounts, the position has been regularised or actions have been taken to address the relevant issues.  The issues in County Cork began to be brought the attention of the Department by the then acting chief executive of the VEC in early 2011.  The Department immediately began engaging with the VEC on the issues.  The VEC kept the Department informed of developments at all stages and this engagement continued throughout the period of transition to the new ETB structure and the succession of the current chief executive in 2013. <\/p> <p>  The Department had concerns regarding both the overall range of issues coming to light and the individual issues.  In carrying out their duties, all public servants, those involved in front line delivery and those with management and oversight roles, must place a high priority on adherence to regulated procedures and to financial and governance accountability, as appropriate.  While the Department was aware that the VEC was taking steps to identify the problems and, most importantly, to address them, it would have been preferred at times if this happened more quickly, even acknowledging that procedures must be followed carefully and can take some time to work through.<\/p> <p>  The details of the ETB&rsquo;s response to the issues are more appropriate for Mr. Owens to outline.  However, the Department&rsquo;s view is that the VEC-ETB&rsquo;s management response to the issues has, ultimately, been comprehensive.<\/p><p>The Department's understanding is that the resolution of matters has been achieved to the extent possible at this time and the Department will continue to work with Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, as necessary.<\/p><p> While there is only one specific recommendation in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for the Department, which has been acted on, the scope of the report points to a need to ensure that robust governance and internal control mechanisms are in place in the ETB sector and beyond.  The committee is aware that the Department has been actively strengthening its role in terms of governance and accountability oversight of institutions and bodies across the education sector.  This process is ongoing and is an area to which we are strongly committed.  The briefing document provided to the committee outlines some of the measures taken to emphasise and improve governance and reporting requirements in the ETB area in particular.  These encompass: legislative change relating to the establishment of ETBs and SOLAS; the issuing of a range of departmental regulations that cover areas such as procurement, tax compliance, borrowing and reporting of losses; a revised code of practice for the sector that sets out clearly a framework for codes of conduct for board and staff members, financial controls in terms of risk management, the internal audit function, audit and finance committees and oversight and reporting requirements; revised terms of reference and steering structures relating to the internal audit service for ETBs; and a more cohesive approach to governance across the education sector that includes enhanced networking with key players involved in governance, audit and oversight.<\/p><p> I will be happy to address these in more detail as well as other queries that the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":881,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#JJ00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":882,"content":"<p>Cork ETB welcomes the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on internal control in County Cork Vocational Education Committee 2011.  Since its establishment in July 2013, Cork ETB has taken over the functions and operations of County Cork VEC, City of Cork VEC and F&Aacute;S.  Cork ETB is a new organisation with responsibility for the organisation of a wide range of education and training services in Cork.  It is responsible for all assets and liabilities of County Cork VEC.<br\/><br\/>The report highlights a number of serious control weaknesses and breaches in procedure in County Cork VEC's operations.  Significant control weaknesses were identified in terms of student enrolment practices and payments to students and staff in Youthreach Macroom.  Procedures were not followed when lease agreements were entered into.  The statutory obligation to seek prior ministerial approval for these leases was not fulfilled.  The report also refers to high legal costs and settlements between 2010 and 2013 and weaknesses that led to a Revenue audit and a significant tax settlement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General found that the departmental guidelines were not followed in the allocation of co-operation hours to the St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation and the costs incurred in connection with the <i>Omar B<\/i>sail training programme were also criticised.<br\/><br\/>As chief executive of Cork ETB, I am committed to ensuring that this new organisation delivers education and training in the Cork region in a compliant, efficient and competent manner.  Cork ETB believes it is important to acknowledge that mistakes were made, rules were not adhered to and proper procedures were not followed in County Cork VEC.  Lessons have been learned and action has been taken on the issues highlighted in the report.  For example, Cork ETB has implemented new procedures for all Youthreach centres, has regularised the position in respect of the leases, has a new service-level agreement in place for the allocation and utilisation of co-operation hours, was one of the first ETBs to undertake a tendering process for legal services and understands that it must be fully compliant with all tax regulations.  Stricter controls have been put in place to ensure that all tax regulations are complied with.<br\/><br\/>In the past two years, Cork ETB has thoroughly reviewed each of these issues and put systems in place to ensure the efficient, effective and compliant use of public funds.  Cork ETB takes responsibility for addressing these failings and continues to strive to ensure that they do not happen in the new organisation.  As chief executive, I assure the committee of my sincere commitment and that of my board members to maintaining the highest standards of performance and corporate governance in Cork ETB in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ted Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Owens.

Earlier in this meeting, we decided we would ask in the presidents of the various colleges concerned along with representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department.  I want to make particular reference to Carlow Institute of Technology and the fact that we received quite a significant amount of redacted material from the Department and an answer to a parliamentary question I asked on 7 July that I find totally unsatisfactory.  However, I intend to deal with that at the public hearing we have planned when all the players are before us, especially the presidents, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and the HEA.<\/p> <p>  During today's meeting, we heard two opening statements, from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Owens.  They reassure us about the future or about the period from now into the future.  I was taken aback by the fact that neither one dealt in any detail with the past and the horrendous lack of governance in the VEC over a long period under the eye of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education and Skills.  I find it shocking, given the number of lives and families that have been destroyed by some of the actions taken by individuals who were involved in some of the controversies in the VEC over those years, that no reference was made to them.  I would like to start from there.<\/p> <p>  The witness referred to the future system as being a well-organised, well-policed, regulated system.  The past must have been the Wild West from what I can read, and there must have been a complete absence on the part of the two Departments that oversee or should have been overseeing the sector comprising the VECs.<\/p> <p>  Is it correct that the nameplate on the door was changed from VEC to ETB? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>Yes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ted Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Owens tell me what changes have taken place in relation to those who serve on the boards locally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>In terms of those who serve on the board locally-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ted Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Current boards by comparison with the VECs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I suppose there has not been a huge change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ted Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":968,"content":"<p>They are all the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436430600,"counter":969,"content":"<p>There are slight changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070900002#NN01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ted Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1436430600,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Let me put it a different way.

I'm happy to be here with you this morning to assist you in whatever way I can in your important endeavour.  You have my written statement, which I'm happy to take as read, but before moving on to questions I'd like to make a brief few points about the nature of my work for the late Brian Lenihan.  <\/p>  <p>          As you said, Chairman, I was special adviser throughout his time in the Department of Finance.  Committee members may know that the legal definition of the role of special adviser is quite broad, and that the Minister to whom the adviser is accountable essentially writes his or her job spec.  In my case, my main duty was to advise Brian Lenihan on the communication of Government actions and decisions taken during the crisis, most of which were complex and difficult.  Throughout the crisis he was acutely conscious of the need to explain to the citizens the reasons for Government actions and the outcomes they were designed to achieve.  His specific objective was to tell the public what went wrong, what the Government was going to do about it and what the outcome of their actions would be.  To achieve that objective, I worked closely with officials in the Department of Finance, drafting and providing speeches, providing briefing for Oireachtas debates, drafting articles for print media and advising on media strategy.  The particular job assigned to me by the then Minister was to work with officials and political colleagues in other Departments of the Government's response to the fiscal crisis.  Between mid-2008 and April 2011, Brian Lenihan introduced six separate sets of budget correction and in his constant battle to stabilise the public finances.  The banking crisis was a separate theatre of battle and initially I had no involvement at all in this area of the Minister's work.  Because of its highly confidential nature, particularly in the months before the guarantee, discussion relating to the banks was necessarily held tightly by a very small group of officials.  I had no role in any banking policy formulation during that period and I have no recollection of receiving any direct information about the banking matters.<\/p> <p> After the guarantee, my involvement in the banking side revolved around the communication of the actions and decisions that the Government had to take to rescue the banks.  I contributed to the drafting of speeches and I worked closely with colleagues in the press office preparing for media interviews and responding to the very significant number of media queries relating to the financial crisis in Ireland.  The Minister didn't ask me to play any role in the formulation of banking policy or to attend any banking meetings about decisions relating to the banks.  He did ask me, along with his press officer, to go to Government Buildings on the night of the guarantee, so that we would be fully briefed for what media announcements might arise from the discussions that were taking place that night.  I played no part in those discussions and spent the night with other colleagues from the Taoiseach's office in adjoining offices.  Mr. Chairman, in my written statement I have drawn on all the knowledge and information I have been able to assemble, much of it acquired after the events which the Committee has asked me to address.  Seven years on from the onset of the crisis, I can't now definitively distinguish between my real-time knowledge of events and what I subsequently learned about them and I'd ask the Committee to bear the possible distorting impact of this in mind when assessing the information contained in that submission.  I'm happy to take your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Herbert","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening remarks, Ms Herbert, and if I can invite our first member this morning to ask questions, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#E00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

I don't intend to quote from this statement but will welcome the opportunity to make some additional comments to the inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  It may be of assistance if I begin by providing the committee with a short introduction of myself so that I may outline my financial background and experience.  In 1970 I graduated from University College Dublin with a bachelor of commerce degree.  Subsequently I trained at Cooper Brothers and Co., now known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973.  <\/p>  <p>         While at Cooper Brothers and Co., I worked in their tax department.  In 1975 I successfully applied to the Civil Service Commission and became an inspector of taxes, where I stayed for six years.  In August 1981 I was made a tax partner at John Woods and Co., now known as Grant Thornton.  In May 1986 I formed Quinlan Ryan, a small chartered accountancy firm, with two partners, and the firm remained in existence for three years.  In May 1989 I commenced trading as a chartered accountant under the title &quot;Derek M. Quinlan, Chartered Accountant&quot;.  In 1990 I put together a deal to purchase a number of units in the recently opened Square shopping centre in Tallaght, Dublin.  This was my first significant property deal on behalf of clients.  Other significant investments took place during the 1990s, including an investment of approximately &euro;250 million in the IFSC.<br\/><br\/>The committee will have noted from my statement that I refer to the ... the activities of Quinlan Private, as I was asked to provide a statement regarding my company.  I believe it is important to note that I would have personally invested in a large number of the investments put together by Quinlan Private.  I would also have invested personally in other investments.  The committee has, I'm sure, at this stage heard from other witnesses that, with hindsight, the growth in the Irish property market from 2001 to 2008 was enormous.  It is now clear, for a number of reasons that were then unknown to me - and, I believe, to the majority of people at that time - that this growth was unsustainable.  I genuinely did not believe that the market was in danger of collapse until I heard of the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion there are three key areas which I feel are important in the context of the inquiry.  During the period 2002 to 2007 there was a huge &quot;feel good&quot; factor in play in Ireland and most people bought into this reality, including myself.  There were very few opposing views.  This was just not an Irish phenomenon, it was actually international.  In his book <i>The Map and the Territory<\/i>, published in 2014, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the American Federal Reserve said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Federal Reserve['s] ... highly sophisticated forecasting system did not foresee a recession until the crisis hit.  Nor [he continued] did the [...] forecasting model developed by the [...] [IMF], which concluded as late as spring 2007 that [the] &quot;[...] economic risks had declined since September 2006 [and that] [...] signs everywhere were encouraging.&quot; <\/blockquote> <p>The second point I'd like to make, I did not realise that the long-term bank finance being provided by the Irish banks was being funded on short-term borrowings from international banks and others.  This model was clearly not sustainable.  If I had known this at the time, I certainly would not have invested in Irish property.  Finally, I was not aware - and I believe that most people were not aware - of what was going on internationally with sub-prime lending in the United States.  This had, I believe, a huge impact on both the Irish and international banking sector, as liquidity dried up in a very short period of time.<br\/><br\/>I believe it's important to note that Quinlan Private invested in quality commercial properties.  These were in prime locations.  I have a fundamental philosophy in relation to property investment which is based on four main tenets: location; timing; liquidity; and confidence.  It is clear, in Ireland, that, at the one time, all of these factors were decimated.  I did not foresee this.  I don't believe it would have been reasonable to do so.  Neither the Irish banks nor the Ministers of finance nor the Economic and Social Research Institute knew that the banking crisis was imminent.  Rather, all parties envisaged a very bright future for the Irish economy and the Government of the day continued with high expenditure to fit in with that forecast.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by taking this opportunity to state that I am deeply saddened at the fallout from the banking crisis.  I recognise that, for a very large number of people in Ireland, it has had an unprecedented and devastating impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#W00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1697,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Quinlan.

It is part of a bigger group called Marsh and McLennan, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market capitalisation of &euro;31 billion.

Good afternoon, Chairman, and inquiry members.  In this brief opening statement, you have asked me to address from my perspective as the finance director of the NTMA during 2007 and 2008, the following lines of inquiry: appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector; adequacy of the assessment of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision; and appropriateness of any expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, banking and the property sector and adequacy of assessment of solvency and liquidity risks.  As advised to the inquiry's investigation team in advance of this submission, in my position as NTMA director of finance, I have no particular insights in the nature of relationships between the Government, the wider political system and the banking and property sectors up to 2008 and therefore I do not believe I am qualified to comment on or add to the first-hand testimony on this topic that has already been provided to the inquiry by other witnesses.  I am not that well-positioned to opine on the adequacy of the assessment of solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions because I had no roles in assessing that back in 2007 and 2008.  That was ultimately a role for the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  The NTMA had no special insight into the banks, domestically or internationally.  All we had were publicly available documents such as credit agency reports, market updates and reports and broker analyst reports.  Not surprisingly, by reference to this published material from somewhat respected and financially literate commentators from 2005 to 2007, one could conclude that, while there were risks, there were no strong warning signals of the financial carnage that would ultimately emerge.  <br\/><br\/>By late 2007, however, although we at the NTMA had no inside information about any bank domestically or internationally, we began to sense that there were early signs of market dislocation beginning to emerge in the capital and money markets.  The first hedge funds failed in early August 2007, followed by regular market rumours about the fragility of various international banks and the unsettling sight of queues of depositors at Northern Rock branches in September 2007.  This caused us at the NTMA to adopt a conservative view of managing the State&rsquo;s cash assets which were raised in the main to fund the national debt.  We had no idea at that stage of the global reach of the credit crisis or of how long it would last or of how serious it would become.<br\/><br\/>As I previously advised the inquiry, we were always sceptical of the business models of at least two Irish financial institutions, Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank, particularly their heavy exposure to property lending and the limited distribution access of Anglo Irish Bank which had no branch network.  We had no credit limit for INBS so we did not do business with them and we restricted our credit limit to &euro;40 million for Anglo Irish Bank even before the crisis started to emerge in 2007.  However, from August 2007 we considered it prudent to reduce our counter-party credit limit exposure to the bank deposit market globally until a clearer picture would emerge.  At that time, it was not an easy decision to justify as all we had was an uneasy sense that the whole global banking and capital market system was more fragile than appeared on the surface, but we had little by way of specific evidence.  Ultimately, things got a lot worse as the months passed and our August 2007 decision proved to be the correct one although it would be a year later before major bank difficulties became more generally visible.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  In relation to other lines of inquiry, it is my understanding from discussion with your investigation team that you wish me to focus in my remarks on the period from mid-2007 to September 2008.  As I advised the inquiry in April this year, there was no substantive discussion involving myself - and as far as I am aware with my senior NTMA colleagues - about a bank guarantee in the months, weeks or days leading up to 30 September 2008 and the NTMA had no involvement in the actual decision to introduce the blanket guarantee.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Hurley, in his evidence, referred to a note prepared by the Department of Finance of an 18 September 2008 meeting at which Dr. Somers, Mr. Corrigan and I were recorded as being present at which, Mr. Hurley states, a guarantee was discussed.  My recollection, which is confirmed by the Department&rsquo;s meeting note, is that the discussion was purely about a deposit<i><\/i>guarantee, not a blanket<i><\/i>guarantee, and that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator did not even favour such an approach at that meeting.  The meeting mainly centred on the merits of increasing the deposit guarantee for individuals from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  For the record, I believe the meeting was actually held on Friday, 19 September not 18 September but that is incidental.<br\/><br\/>Whilst my colleague, Mr, Whelan, and I were in Government Buildings on the night of 29 September, we were not, as I have previously advised, made aware as to the reason why we were there .... why we were required or consulted or otherwise asked to input prior to the Government taking the guarantee decision.  Once the Government had decided to introduce a blanket guarantee, my focus and that of Mr. Whelan as public servants was, and you will appreciate, on the implications of that decision and its effect on the NTMA as the State&rsquo;s debt manager and, more immediately, on how the NTMA would deal with the market and credit rating agency reaction to the decision at 7 a.m. that very morning.<br\/><br\/>As the banking crisis unfolded in the two weeks immediately before 30 September 2008, the NTMA's engagement with the Department of Finance had focused on three main strands.  <\/p>  <p>         The first strand was the provision of secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, if so directed by the Minister, second, the NTMA input into draft legislation dealing with the possible nationalisation of two financial institutions, a building society draft nationalisation Bill and a bank draft nationalisation Bill and three, the NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch on 24 September on behalf of the Minister for Finance to provide advice.<br\/><br\/>On the first issue on discussions and secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, the NTMA had in fact been engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance from April 2008 about the provision of emergency liquidity in circumstances where the Irish banks could not meet their funding requirements from the wholesale markets.  This was separate to the engagement we'd been having with the Department of Finance from the summer of 2007 in relation to the NTMA placement of bank deposits, which I will deal with later.  By September 2008, these discussions had intensified and the NTMA had in place arrangements to allow it, in the event that it was directed by the Minister, to engage in emergency collateralised lending to the Irish banks.  I estimate that we had about &euro;5 billion in liquidity available at that time, across various mandates that could be lent up to one year.  The NTMA had been maintaining a floor to its liquidity and allowed it to supply a certain amount of emergency funding requirements but only if directed by the Minister.  There had also been discussion about the NTMA accumulating a war chest of liquidity to deal with the emerging banking liquidity crisis.  However, while the NTMA was continuing to issue commercial paper of up to &euro;20 billion, which was as long-dated as possible, with a maximum 12-month maturity, it was clear that there was no appetite from longer-term bond market investors to invest on the scale needed to create a cash buffer to deal with even part of the potential fallout from the banks.  This was particularly the case given the pressures the sovereign was already experience in terms of funding the national debt during 2008, which was &euro;50 billion approximately. <br\/><br\/>NTMA&rsquo;s input into the bank ... draft bank and building society nationalisation legislation: our input into draft legislation being prepared during September 2008 by the Department of Finance to deal with the possible nationalisation of a building society and of a bank related mainly to the role the NTMA could play in providing restructuring assistance post-nationalisation and technical advices on obligations arising under the Companies Act, which could potentially limit the Minister&rsquo;s power to manage a nationalised institution.<br\/><br\/>Three, the NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch to advise the Minister for Finance.: the NTMA engaged Merrill Lynch on 24 September but we were not prepared to enter into a contract with them without the Minister&rsquo;s approval.  On 26 September 2008, Secretary General Department of Finance, Mr. Cardiff, confirmed in an e-mail to me that the Minister was instructing the NTMA to engage Merrill Lynch to provide corporate finance advice to him.  I understand that Merrill Lynch met the Minister and senior officials within his Department, including Mr. Doyle and Mr. Cardiff, to discuss strategic options that evening.  I will discuss the quality of the expert advice later in my opening comments.<br\/><br\/>NTMA knowledge of a blanket bank guarantee: the first and only reference to a blanket bank guarantee throughout all the engagement in September 2008 was an e-mail that I received from Mr. Beausang, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance, at 1.26 p.m. on Friday, 26 September 2008.  The e-mail, issued on the instruction of the Secretary General, sought the NTMA&rsquo;s view on, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the potential sovereign implications of a blanket bank guarantee.  I responded that afternoon at 2.22 p.m. after receiving a phone call from Mr. Beausang in which he sought an urgent response to the Department&rsquo;s ... for the Department's Secretary General.  Without having much time to consider the matter, I discussed it with my colleague, Mr. Whelan, and in my reply to Mr. Beausang, I pointed out that the real exposures to the Exchequer from the banking system had not yet been independently qualified ... quantified, and that would make any assessment of a bank guarantee extremely difficult.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s e-mail to me referred to a possible total funding requirement of approximately &euro;100 billion for the two institutions expected to be nationalised, as estimated by Merrill Lynch, and also a wider guarantee for the other institutions.  I pointed out that, in the event of such a major decision being made, the credit ratings agencies would &quot;be taken aback&quot; at the scale of the State involvement that a blanket guarantee would necessitate and that there would be an immediate credit ratings downgrade of Ireland from AAA and a concomitant rise in the cost of funding the national debt.  I also made the observation that, given the potential size of any guarantee relative to the size of the economy, Ireland could &quot;expect to pay a lot more than Greece<i>&quot; <\/i>in the international money markets.  Greece, as you know, was an outlier at that time in terms of bond yield spreads at about 75 basis points in the ten-year maturity over Germany; Ireland was about 45 basis points, I recall.  There was no follow-up from the Department to my e-mail.<br\/><br\/>NTMA deposit placement: prior to September 2008, engagement between the NTMA and the Department of Finance related primarily to the NTMA&rsquo;s placement of bank deposits.  This reflected the view in many quarters that the problem in the banking system domestically was one of liquidity, not solvency.  By August 2007, the NTMA had made the decision firstly to reduce existing counterparty credit lines with a range of global financial institutions and to stop placing deposits with any bank.  The NTMA policy was to move maturing deposits back to the Central Bank of Ireland &ndash; we referred to it internally as safe-harbouring deposits.  The Department of Finance was fully aware of the NTMA&rsquo;s position in this regard.  The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Doyle, was a member of the NTMA advisory committee, which received updates from me, as finance director, on the NTMA&rsquo;s counterparty credit limit policy and counterparty credit list at its September and December 2007 meetings, and this continued throughout 2008.  I recall at these meetings that Mr. Doyle, as a member of the NTMA advisory committee, did not agree with the NTMA&rsquo;s position on deposit placements and safe-harbouring at the Central Bank but the overall advisory committee agreed with the NTMA senior management&rsquo;s position and consistently advised us to take a conservative and prudent approach to counterparty risk.<br\/><br\/>In mid-December 2007, the NTMA was invited to the latter stages of a domestic standing group meeting with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to discuss the placing of deposits within existing credit limits with Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million, AIB, &euro;200 million, Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;50 million and EBS, &euro;50 million. An existing deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank, with a maturity of one year, had been in place before the NTMA made its decision to cease placing the deposits with the banks and to place them instead with the Central Bank.  The NTMA&rsquo;s position at this meeting, which took place, I believe on 12 December 2007, was that, in the absence of a written direction from the Minister, we did not intend reversing this policy of placing bank deposits in financial institutions.  We made the point at the meeting that, if anything, the risks attaching to the banking system, internationally as well as domestically, had become even more pronounced since the original August 2007 decision of the NTMA to safe-harbour<i><\/i>maturing deposits with the Central Bank.  Following that meeting, the Minister for Finance at the time, Mr. Cowen, wrote to the chief executive of the NTMA, Dr. Somers, on 19 December 2007, directing the NTMA to place deposits with the four main banks, namely, Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS.  The Minister also sought proposals for additional NTMA activity within financial markets and the expansion of NTMA credit lines <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>banks.I have already referred to our subsequent engagement in 2008, particularly in September 2008, with the Minister and the Department on these two points.  My colleague, Mr. Whelan wrote to the second Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Cardiff, also on 19 December 2007, seeking clarification that the Minister&rsquo;s correspondence constituted a direction under section 4(4) of the NTMA Act 1990.  Mr. Cardiff confirmed on behalf of the Minister, in correspondence on 21 December 2007, that this was the case.  As regards maturities, Mr. Cardiff added, &quot;The intention is to leave appropriate discretion to yourselves, but the aim should be to considerably in excess of one month and preferably towards three months,&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>The NTMA wrote again to the Department of Finance, by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff, on 18 February and 18 April 2008, respectively, seeking clarification as to whether the Minister&rsquo;s direction of 19 December 2007 applied to the roll-over of maturing deposits with Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS. Mr. Cardiff responded on both occasions to confirm that the Minister&rsquo;s direction did so apply and all deposits should be renewed on maturity.  On 17 June 2008, the new Minister for Finance, Mr. Lenihan, in correspondence to Dr. Somers, directed the roll-over of Bank of Ireland and AIB deposits on an unsecured basis and an increase in deposit sizes with Irish Life and Permanent from &euro;50 million to &euro;250 million and EBS from &euro;40 million to &euro;100 million, on a secured collateralised basis.  In correspondence to the Minister on 27 June 2008, Dr. Somers confirmed the placement of deposit funds in the Irish market as follows: Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months, AIB, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months, Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;250 million collateralised deposit for 12 months, EBS, &euro;100 million collateralised deposit for 12 months.  The NTMA chief executive also advised that the NTMA did not intend to renew a one-year unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank which fell due on 8 August 2008, as the deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s December 2007 direction.  On 17 July 2008, I wrote by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff to again advise that an unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank would mature on 8 August 2008 and asked whether the Minister intended to direct<i><\/i>the NTMA to renew the deposit.  As advised in the NTMA's chief executive&rsquo;s earlier correspondence to the Minister, it was the NTMA&rsquo;s view that Anglo Irish deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s 2007 direction and the NTMA&rsquo;s position is that it did not intend to renew the deposit.  Mr. Cardiff wrote to me on behalf of the Minister directing the NTMA to place a &euro;40 million one-year collateralised deposit with Anglo Irish Bank and to roll over the NTMA&rsquo;s &euro;200 million deposits with Bank of Ireland and AIB on a six-month collateralised basis.  <\/p>  <p>         On 25 July 2008, I wrote to Mr. Cardiff to advise him that Anglo Irish Bank was not interested in doing a deal on a collateralised basis especially for only &euro;40 million, and had requested instead that the NTMA renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on an unsecured one-year basis.  Mr. Cardiff advised, on 28 July 2008, that Mr. Cardiff wished the NTMA to renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on a three-monthly maturity.  There could have been no ambiguity at any time during this period on the part of senior Department of Finance officials or the Minister for Finance as to the NTMA's position on global bank risk from August 2007 and our reluctance, given the increasing dislocation of financial markets, to put at risk any State money under our management by placing it on deposit with domestic or international financial institutions unless we were directed to do so by the Minister for Finance.  <br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used: From mid-September 2008, when my colleagues, Mr. Corrigan, Mr. Whelan and I were requested to attend meetings which the Department of Finance had scheduled with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, it was obvious to me and also, I believe, to my colleagues, that there was a dearth of information or analysis available in terms of real insight as to the financial state of the domestic banks and building societies.  It surprised us that there appeared to be only one or, at most, two Financial Regulator staff engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution, even those institutions with balance sheets of up to &euro;200 billion.  At one particular meeting at the outset of the evolving crisis, Mr. Neary, the Financial Regulator, inquired as to the <i>locus standi<\/i>of NTMA officials at these meetings given banking confidentiality issues.  Mr. Cardiff dealt with this and advised that the NTMA had been requested to attend and provide advice to the Department of Finance by the Minister himself.  Each of the financial institutions in late September 2008 were beginning to retain investment banks as advisers.  A decision was taken by the Minister that the State needed its own investment bank to advise it and the NTMA requested to engage that advice and this was arranged by my colleague, Mr. Corrigan.<br\/><br\/>During the last two weeks of September 2008, the whole focus was on having legislation ready to nationalise a building society and a bank, if required.  The NTMA provided technical input into that draft legislation.  A separate piece of legislation was also being prepared by the Department of Finance and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office which would enable the NTMA and the Central Bank to provide secured lending to the financial institutions.  <br\/><br\/>Considerable pressure was being applied at the September 2008 Department of Finance-Central Bank-Financial Regulator meetings on the NTMA to increase the amount of deposits placed with the Irish banking system as Irish institutions rapidly began to lose liquidity.  The NTMA refused and advised it was our view of our chief executive, Dr. Somers, that it was the role of the Central Bank to be the lender of last resort; it was not the role of the NTMA as a debt management agency.  This caused considerable tension but we maintained our position.  <br\/><br\/>Merrill Lynch was in place for about four days before the guarantee decision was made.  In my view, it was only after that guarantee decision was made and through the work of PwC on behalf of the Financial Regulator, and the work of Merrill Lynch after the guarantee decision, that the real picture began to emerge of what was really going on in the Irish banking system and the scale of property and other lending.  That emerging picture of asset and liability mismatch based on the PwC-Merrill Lynch work from mid-October 2008 onwards was very alarming.  Excessive lending by financial institutions funded by short-term wholesale deposits, which were disappearing rapidly, with the result that liquidity from the Central Bank and the ECB was required and capital injections were inevitable.  The ECB then, unlike today, was not very accommodative in terms of the type of collateral it would accept from the banks.  By then, the damage had been done.  <br\/><br\/>During the autumn of 2008 and the early part of 2009, I continued to perform my full-time role as NTMA finance director while also attempting, on almost a full-time basis, to assist the Department of Finance and my senior NTMA colleagues in its efforts to deal with the possible collapse of the Irish banking system and the direct effect on Ireland as the sovereign.  <br\/><br\/>Subsequent to the period that we have just discussed, my professional responsibilities within the NTMA shifted to the establishment of NAMA from May 2009 and, as you know, I've already provided the inquiry with evidence as regards the NAMA experience.  I hope that in these brief opening comments, I have given you a sense of my engagement and that of the NTMA and the Department of Finance and Minister for Finance during 2007 and 2008.  Thank you, Chairman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":2343,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McDonagh.

And of course, the position was maintained by all the banks in the autumn of 2008 that they were fine, they didn't need capital.  If they did need capital they needed a small amount of capital.  They'd only take capital if another institution took capital - this sort of silly game-playing was going on.  And they'd source capital from third parties if they needed to.

People are saying, \"It's not worth my job to get 50 basis points if I'm not going to get the money back.\"  I think the view really is that liquidity ... the view is that all it is is a liquidity problem.

I have been asked to provide a statement to the inquiry covering 24 lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I was appointed to that position on 3 December 1990, for a period of five years by the Minister for Finance and was re-appointed several times, finally retiring on 3 December 2009.  I had previously been Secretary General, national debt management, in the Department of Finance from April 1987 and before that, I was Secretary General of Department of Defence from February 1985.  I served at various levels in the Department of Finance, initially in the pensions section and later in the finance division.  I also spent a period of just under two years in the Central Bank up to 1970.<\/p>  <p>  As I was largely responsible for the establishment of the NTMA and its growing range of functions over 19 years, I would like to outline the rationale for its rather unique structure and how it operated.  The reason for the establishment of the NTMA was the very heavy burden of the national debt at the end of the 1980s and the absence of suitably-qualified personnel in the Department of Finance to deal with the complex issue of raising funds on the international capital markets at optimum rates of interest.  The then Minister for Finance, speaking on the NTMA Bill before the D&aacute;il in 1990, said the debt was one of the highest in the OECD at over 120% of GNP at end 1989, while interest payments were put in 1990 at 9% of GNP, which he said was almost equivalent to the total yield from income tax in the PAYE sector.  He continued that it was about 60% greater than total Exchequer expenditure on the health services.<\/p>  <p>  The powers of the NTMA were very strictly circumscribed by legislation and related to the delegation of powers of the Minister for Finance to borrow money to fund the Exchequer.  The NTMA had no power to provide any assistance to the banking sector and would have been acting outside its remit, and probably in breach of EU law, to have done so by its own decision.  The following paragraphs set out the carefully designed legal basis on which it was established and operated.  When funds were being raised abroad and legal documents had to be signed, it was generally done by officials of the Department of Finance acting on the basis of a signed and sealed power of attorney, given by the Minister for Finance.  It would have been completely impracticable for the Minister to personally negotiate and execute all the documentation relating to loans raised throughout the world.  Nevertheless, questions had been raised, generally by Irish lawyers, about the legitimacy of this procedure on the basis that the Minister could not delegate his power to a civil servant.  There could have been some validity in this argument.  It was felt unwise to see it legally tested as, if found to be wrong, it would have created an impossible situation in the absence of some complex legislative change.<\/p>  <p>  However, when the creation of the NTMA was being considered, it was essential that this issue be resolved as there was no room for questioning the legal capacity of the NTMA to enter into contracts binding the State for very large financial commitments.  Also, it was not intended the NTMA would be required to obtain a separate power of attorney from the Minister for Finance for every transaction undertaken &ndash; a situation that, as mentioned earlier, could be legally challenged anyway.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, the creation of the NTMA raised constitutional issues as the functions which it would be called upon to perform were part of the executive power of the State.  That power can only be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.  It was felt that if the borrowing of money for the Exchequer and the management of the national debt were taken away from the Minister for Finance, it could be questioned as to whether he was still Minister for Finance.  It was, however, recognised that the Government could delegate the functions of a Minister to a Minister of State, while still retaining the power to exercise those functions himself or herself.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas provided the NTMA would be established as a body to perform, on the authority of the Government, the functions delegated to it by the Government under the Act, at that time principally borrowing and debt management.  In effect it was established as a type of corporate Minister of State.  The Government would delegate to it certain functions of the Minister for Finance.  These would be performed, subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister and subject to such guidelines and directions as he would give it.  The chief executive would be appointed by the Minister and be directly responsible, i.e. not through a Department, to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.  The chief executive, who could not be a civil servant, would be answerable to the D&aacute;il Public Accounts Committee.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the importance of the NTMA&rsquo;s functions as part of the executive power of the State, it was further determined that there could not be a board of directors, as with a State body, because this would diffuse responsibility to an unacceptable degree.  Instead, there would be an advisory committee to assist and advise the agency on whatever it might request and be consulted by the Minister on the terms and conditions of appointment of the chief executive.  <\/p>  <p>         The above arrangements applied throughout my period as chief executive of the NTMA.  They were, however, fundamentally changed by the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, but these changes are not relevant to my statement.<\/p> <p> I would like to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the evidence that my colleagues and I gave to the public accounts committee on 14 May 2009, over a period of about four hours.  This covered, quite comprehensively, what the NTMA knew about the banking crisis at the time and the actions it had taken.  I should add that on rereading the evidence I gave then, I would not see any reason to significantly change any of it.  I resigned\/retired from the NTMA about six months later and just over one year before my contract expired. <\/p> <p> As a general comment before turning to the specific lines of inquiry that the committee has addressed to me, I should make the point the NTMA was quite a small organisation at that time, with a total staff of 169 when I left at end-2009.  It had four main businesses, namely the borrowing and debt management functions of the State - its original purpose; the management of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; the State Claims Agency; and the National Development Finance Agency, as well as a significant number of other functions, including a small NAMA unit.  These had all been assigned to the NTMA in accordance with a large number of pieces of primary legislation.  A NAMA unit was set up in advance of legislation.  I should emphasise that the NTMA had no regulatory, policing or oversight role and, except to the extent I might be asked for specific views, no policy input role.  It was recognised by the Nyberg report that the NTMA was not a public authority.  Nevertheless, it did provide any and all assistance it was asked for during the banking crisis, but would not have been party to, or present at, many of the discussions between Government Ministers, the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. <\/p> <p> I propose to respond to each of the 24 lines of inquiry in the order that you set out.  I should state that, in several instances, I am unable to provide any assistance as I have no information on the subjects.  In the case of others, where I have no specific knowledge, I have given such information or views as I have or may have expressed elsewhere. <\/p> <p> The effectiveness of ECOFIN and DSG - the adequacy of the DSG process, including consideration of the bank resolution legislation.  I had no involvement with ECOFIN from the time the NTMA was established.  The NTMA had been invited to attend DSG meetings from late 2007 onwards in relation to the placing of deposits with domestic commercial banks.  As stated in the Nyberg report, the NTMA reacted to the onset of the credit crisis like most market participants by withdrawing much of their deposits from private institutions and placing them with central banks.  The NTMA provided advice and assistance from 2007 in the following areas: assistance in accessing specialist expertise; preparation of contract documentation; gathering market intelligence; assisting with communications with rating agencies and providing information concerning cost implications of changes in sovereign debt rating; the provision of liquidity to Irish banks on the basis of ministerial direction.  It also put in place arrangements to allow it to engage in collateralised lending to Irish banks.  The NTMA provided comments on draft legislation, as requested, from time to time. <\/p> <p> The next item - effectiveness of the CBI liquidity group under the joint financial stability committee.  The NTMA was asked to attend a group to discuss liquidity.  This was composed of a member or members of the Government, the Central Bank, Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, the Financial Regulator and the Attorney General - not all present on every occasion.  There was generally a discussion on the liquidity situation of the banks, the extent of their borrowing from the Central Bank and problems associated with emergency lending.  Frequently, all the attendees other than the NTMA, Central Bank staff and regulator's staff would adjourn to another room to discuss the situation.  The role of the NTMA was generally to specify what funds we had.  There was, from time to time, discussions on the NTMA placing funds with the Irish banks.  We would do so but, on legal advice, only on the basis of a written direction from the Minister for Finance.  I attended many of these meetings myself, and invariably did so when the Minister for Finance wished me to be present.  Generally, however, someone from the NTMA was present in Government Buildings when meetings were in progress, but, in many instances, would not have been in attendance at some or most of those meetings.  This was also my experience. <\/p> <p> The role of advisers in analysing the crisis -  at the request of the Minister for Finance, we hired Merrill Lynch to provide advice to him.  The apparent reason for the involvement of the NTMA in this was that the Department of Finance wanted us to charge the cost to the NTMA operating budget, as they did not have adequate funds in their own budget to meet the cost - ultimately about &euro;6 million.  We also hired Dr. Peter Bacon, at the Minister&rsquo;s request, to produce a report for him which, ultimately, became the basis for NAMA.  In addition, PwC and Arthur Cox were engaged to provide financial and legal due diligence services, respectively, in regard to the Minister&rsquo;s directed investments by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission into AIB and Bank of Ireland in 2009. <\/p> <p> The liquidity versus solvency debate - there is some validity in the argument that lack of liquidity can lead to insolvency.  Many businesses that are solvent on an ongoing basis will rapidly become insolvent if they run out of cash and have to realise assets suddenly in what might be called a fire sale.  However, in the case of the banks, the enormous amounts they had lent to individual developers to enable them to pay extraordinarily high prices for property, and the rolling up of interest, much of which may have been taken into the profit and loss account, meant that insolvency was almost inevitable.  <\/p>  <p>         Department of Finance actions - appraisal of the conditions relating to increasing the deposit guarantee scheme; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  I was in the United States on the night that the decision was taken and only became aware of it through a text message from a colleague the following morning.  If there was a risk of a run on the banks, then a guarantee on deposits was probably the best course of action.  I understand that the senior bonds were issued on the basis that they ranked <i>pari passu<\/i>with deposits.  The rationale for guaranteeing other bonds is not clear.<br\/><br\/>Effectiveness of reviews of banks&rsquo; loans books and capital adequacy.  I saw the PwC review of the banks&rsquo; loan books.  At that stage the damage had been done and the only question was the scale of the disaster.  The early review underestimated the size of the ultimate losses; much larger State support was later required.<br\/><br\/>Decision to nationalise Anglo in 2009 and alternatives.  At that stage it was probably inevitable.  By then there was nothing to indicate that it had a future as a privately-owned institution.<br\/><br\/>Establishment, operation and effectiveness of NAMA.  The decision to establish NAMA was taken very quickly by the Minister for Finance and I supported the Minister when he announced it.  I also, at his request, went to see Mr. Trichet at the ECB to tell him that we would need about &euro;60 million ... sorry, &euro;60 billion from the ECB to fund it.  I was hesitant about the amount of money that was going to be paid into the banks and the rapidity with which it was to be done.  The Minister felt it would free up the banks to start lending again.  I felt that we should take just some loans from the banks and see if that would encourage them to lend.  I also felt that the banks should be pressed to recover the loans themselves as they knew where the bodies were buried.  Transferring them to NAMA would be a bonanza for lawyers and other professionals, as well as requiring a large staff in NAMA.  In the event, a very large number of loans were transferred to NAMA at a substantial discount.  And regardless of what happened, the likelihood is that the outcome would have been the same.<br\/><br\/>Decision to recapitalise Anglo, AIB, etc., and alternatives.  Some type of banking system had to be preserved for the State and the Minister went for the two pillar bank model.  EBS was taken over by AIB.  The problem was that NAMA imposed very substantial discounts on the loans they took over - and I'm not in a position to give a view on the correctness of their discounts - and this had the effect of wiping out the capital of the banks.  They, therefore, had to be recapitalised to stay in business.<br\/><br\/>The cost of the crisis and sharing of the impact.  I have no particular insights on this.<br\/><br\/>Role and influence of the ECB.  The ECB and the Irish Central Bank - as part of the ECB - had a role as lender of last resort.  They did provide very considerable resources to the Irish banking system, with a reported 25% of their total lending being extended to the Irish banking system.  My only involvement with the ECB was, as mentioned earlier, to ask Mr. Trichet for funding for NAMA.<br\/><br\/>Options for burden sharing during 2008-2013.  In terms of sharing the burden with other eurozone countries, this just did not find acceptance.  In terms of what happened within the State, this was a matter for Government decision.  On the more general question, repayments abroad by the State in respect of its own debts were made as were repayments in respect of senior bank bonds, which, as I understand it, legally ranked <i>pari passu<\/i>with bank deposits.  Other repayments on junior bonds were also made.  However, many of the other payments were between Irish residents themselves and, as such, were a transfer of wealth within the Irish State.  In terms of the impact that they had on the balance sheets of banks and on their incurred losses, these had the same impact as if the cash involved was transferred out of the country.  There is, in my view, a valid argument that, to the extent that losses were incurred by Irish banks arising out of transfers between Irish citizens - and which gave rise in part to the need to recapitalise the Irish banks - the case for transfers from other countries, by way of free money or grants, to recapitalise the Irish banks was questionable.  Also to the extent to which cheap funds - i.e., at interest rates below what otherwise would have been the case - were made available to Ireland, there was a transfer of wealth from other eurozone countries to Ireland.  This applied particularly to funds provided by the ECB and this could be classified as burden-sharing.<br\/><br\/>The role of the eurozone and international partners in the decision.  I was not involved in this area.<br\/><br\/>The ... B1(a), the adequacy of board ... the composition, skills and experience of the board and board sub-committees; adequacy of board oversight over internal controls to ensure risk is properly identified, managed and monitored.  As CEO of the NTMA, I had no involvement with the above.  However, I would have read their annual reports and was very impressed at what they said they were doing in the area of corporate governance and risk management.  Boards can, however, be quite reliant on management to bring to their attention such items as are of importance.  There can be a tendency to swamp directors with vast amounts of paper and without prioritising issues with which a board should concern itself.  This may be seen as a form of self-protection by management, which can argue at a later date that all matters were brought to directors&rsquo; attention.  I do not know to what extent this was happening in Irish banks prior to the crash or the rationale they had for the very rapid expansion of credit.  Another important factor is the consensus culture on boards, where a discordant note may not be welcome, particularly on the part of a dominant chairman.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of funding sources - the mix, maturity profile and cost.  As CEO of the NTMA, this would not have been an area where I would have had an involvement.  I would have presumed that the highest standards would have applied.  However, I was somewhat perplexed at the very rapid growth in credit and on one occasion spent some time going through the Central Bank statistics to try to understand it.  <\/p>  <p>         The closest I could get to finding out the backing for this credit expansion was that, in respect of their Irish businesses, the Irish banks had borrowed somewhere between &euro;100 billion and &euro;200 billion.  As I was surprised at this, I asked a colleague to check my figures to see if it was correct.  He confirmed my findings, but was able to provide a more accurate figure.<\/p> <p> On the same general question of some banks' approach to funding costs, I should add that on a reasonably regular basis, I came across non-Irish banks that lent money to us, and as far as I could see, either made no money, lost money, or took risks on their funding that I would have regarded as, at best, questionable on their part.  To some extent, at least, banks internationally were buying market share or keeping themselves high in international rating lists, even where deals made little or no financial sense.  I would not have thought this applied to Irish banks.<\/p> <p> R1 (c) - appropriateness of the macroeconomic and prudential policy.  As CEO of the NTMA, I had no functional role in these areas and would have been very .. would have very little knowledge of prudential policy.  However, I was surprised that public expenditure was not cut back after the 2007 election, as it had been after the 2002 election, if for no other reason than to increase it again before the next election.  I also felt that the level of house and apartment building was unsustainable by any measure and, if applied proportionately to other countries, would have given figures that were multiples of what they were actually doing.  I think the same view was held by some persons at Government level and the hope was that at least some of the building workers could be employed in other non-housing construction areas.  I was also aware that costs and prices in Ireland were rising more rapidly than elsewhere in euro land.  These issues are difficult to correct, particularly in the absence of a crisis, and where so many people are benefitting.<\/p> <p> The fundamental problem arose because Ireland moved from a regime which had relatively high annual growth in wages and prices but which also had its own currency and control over its value.  While movements in that currency were constrained by Ireland's membership of the European Monetary System, it was possible to have currency devaluations with the agreement of other member states.  What this meant was that when a country got into currency-related difficulties, it could, in effect, press the reset button by devaluing the currency and starting again.  This flexibility went when Ireland joined the euro, but, in return, it was relieved of the risk of speculative pressures on its exchange rate and enjoyed a much lower interest rate regime.  It also gained access to what appeared to be virtually limitless sources of credit.  However, because the pattern of relatively high wage and price increases continued, competitiveness was gradually lost.  Also, the Irish banks, instead of covering their lending from a large population of small to medium deposits, i.e. not large corporate deposits, relied to a great degree on borrowings from the international interbank market.  By their nature these funds are short-term and need to be constantly rolled over.  When this becomes difficult, and other sources of funding are not available, a crisis arises, which is what happened.<\/p> <p> Effectiveness of the supervisory practice, Central Bank, Financial Regulator and Department of Finance: The NTMA had no involvement in the supervisory practice.<\/p> <p> Appropriateness of the expert advice sought: as mentioned earlier, on the instructions of the Minister for Finance the NTMA got advice for him from Merrill Lynch and from Dr. Peter Bacon.  It may be the Minister was receiving advice from other sources also.  His decision to create NAMA would have been based on advice he obtained from Dr. Bacon.  Advice was also got from PwC and Arthur Cox.<\/p> <p> Analysis of contrarian views: by the time the crisis occurred, I do not recall any strongly voiced contrarian views which were ... would have had a significant bearing on its outcome.  There were always calls from the Central Bank and other international organisations for more prudence on the part of governments.  This constant crying of wolf would have blunted its effectiveness.<\/p> <p> Appropriateness of advice from the Department of Finance to the Government: apart from seeing a draft of a memorandum for the Government recommending the establishment of NAMA, I would not have been aware of what advice they were giving to the Government.<\/p> <p> Appropriateness of the relationship between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: the NTMA would not have had any particular insights into these relationships and I would not be in a position to offer any view on them.<\/p> <p> Adequacy and impact of international organisations' oversight on banking regulation: the NTMA would have had no knowledge of what was going on in this area.<\/p> <p> There may be a perception in some circles that the NTMA was some, sort of, shadow Department of Finance or Central Bank.  While this was most certainly not the case, the NTMA did provide all such assistance and advice as we could during the financial crisis, based on the experience and knowledge we had and we assisted in procuring such other advice as was requested of us.  The Central Bank-Financial Regulator had a very large staff to deal with the banking sector.  The NTMA's role was very clear.  Its primary function was to raise funds for the Exchequer, not to provide liquidity for the banks.  This was the role of the Central Bank, as lender of last resort.<\/p> <p> To put the role of the NTMA in context during the financial crisis and to show that we were actually doing in ... doing in line with our legal obligations, it may be worthwhile to set out some of the challenges faced and activities undertaken in 2009, and the situation at the end of that year.  We had a very full workload.  The national debt had gone up by &euro;25 billion during the year to stand at &euro;75 billion.  Even with that, however, the general government debt-GDP ratio was 65.6%, well below the EU average of 78.7%.  <\/p>  <p>         On a net basis, after deducting off cash balances and the assets of the National Pensions Reserves Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s debt-GDP ratio was 37.9% at end 2009.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009, of which &euro;24.6 billion was used to fund the Exchequer deficit, &euro;5 billion to refinance a maturing &euro;5 billion bond, leaving &euro;5 billion in long-term funding for the 2010 deficit.  Foreign investors held 84% of Ireland&rsquo;s bonds at end 2009.  The four major credit rating agencies still rated Ireland at AA at end 2009.  The yield premium over Germany had narrowed to 1.45%, down from 3 % earlier in the year.  The debt service costs were &euro;686 million below budget, approximately half of which was due to interest rates achieved by the NTMA on 2009 borrowing, which were lower than those prevailing at the time the supplementary budget, which was agreed in April 2009.<\/p> <p> The State Claims Agency - the name used by the NTMA when dealing with claims - had received 1,219 new claims during 2009, had settled 1,631 claims and was managing about 4,000 claims at year end.  Of these, there were 1,783 clinical claims under management, with an estimated cost of &euro;693 million.  Obstetric-related claims, although only 18% of the total, represented 57% of the total estimated liability.  The State Claims Agency had a statutory brief to provide advice and assistance to all health enterprises and worked to support patient safety and help minimise clinical claims.  A comprehensive programme of training and services was undertaken in 2009, particularly targeted at hospital consultants and other speciality groups.  The State Claims Agency also dealt with employer liability, public liability and third-party property damage claims, with 2,271 such claims - having an estimated cost of &euro;90 million - under management at end 2009.  In this area, the SCA encouraged State authorities to implement internationally benchmarked health and safety management systems and worked with the Defence Forces, the Irish Prison Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other Government Departments.<\/p> <p> The NTMA, as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, invested &euro;7 billion in preference shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland on the direction of the Minister for Finance, known as directed investments.  Arrangements were also made to transfer the assets of 16 universities and non-commercial State bodies&rsquo; pension funds to the NPRF.  The fund disinvested from seven companies and excluded four others because of their involvement in the manufacture of cluster munitions or other anti-personnel devices or because they had not sufficiently distanced themselves from their manufacture.<\/p> <p> The NPRF was invested in quoted equities, including global large cap, global small cap and global emerging markets, fixed income, including eurozone government bonds and corporate bonds, and alternative assets, including private equity, property, commodities and forestry, absolute return investments and infrastructure, as well as the directed investments in the two main banks.  The directed portfolio, i.e., excluding the investment in the banks, recorded a return of 20.6% in 2009.  The fund at end 2009 was valued at &euro;22.3 billion.<\/p> <p> The National Development Finance Agency, established in 2003 to provide a financial advisory service to State bodies in respect of capital projects, had its remit significantly expanded in 2007 to include the actual procurement of all PP public capital projects, except transport projects.  By end 2009, the NDFA had completed its advice on 48 projects with a combined capital value of over &euro;6.5 billion, was working on over 50 active projects and had brought the first bundle of schools to financial close.  Among the projects on which the NDFA had provided advice, and which were commissioned in 2009 or shortly thereafter, were the Criminal Courts of Justice building, the Dublin Convention Centre, the Aviva Stadium, the national integrated medical imaging system and much work had been put into metro north project, as well as the third level education PPP programme, the National Concert Hall, the DART underground project and the national plan for radiation oncology.<\/p> <p> In addition to the above functions, the NTMA was responsible for: the Housing Finance Agency commercial paper programme; the provision of central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies - local government authorities, the HSE and vocational educational committees - providing them with a competitive alternative to the banking sector for their treasury business; the European Central Bank liquidity management, which was regulating the level of Government cash balances at the Central Bank of Ireland; agricultural commodity intervention bills issued on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture to fund the gap between agricultural intervention payments by the Minister and recoupment from the EU &ndash; there was a turnover &euro;465 billion, sorry, that's million, I think,  in 2009; dormant accounts fund - certain unclaimed balances on bank accounts and insurance policies are received and managed by the NTMA, &euro;135 million at end 2009, pending disbursement by the Government or repayment to the owners; the social insurance fund - the NTMA had managed the surplus on this fund since 2001 and during 2009 transferred &euro;2.9 billion back to the Department of Social and Family Affairs; emissions trading - the NTMA was designated as the national purchasing agent for the purchase of carbon credits on behalf of Ireland in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.<\/p> <p> In summary, at end 2009 the NTMA had &euro;21.8 billion in liquid assets to fund the Exchequer into the future and &euro;22.3 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and its total staff at end 2009 was 169.  By the time the NTMA was brought into the deliberations on the banking crisis, there were no easy solutions.  However, by virtue of the fact that the NTMA existed and had prudently managed its operations, the State was in a much better condition financially to tackle the crisis than would otherwise have been the case.

The story was that if we didn't do this, the banks wouldn't start lending again.  Now, of course, you could say, with the benefit of hindsight, well, did we really want them to start lending again?  It was the lending that had caused all the trouble, and did we want to facilitate them in this?  But anyway, that was, kind of, beside the point  But, I felt that ... the banks were supposed to have 5,000 people dealing with all these problem loans, and we, at that stage, didn't have anybody.  I mean, we needed to build up a NAMA operation.  Now, I was very conscious myself of how difficult it is to get suitable people, to weld them into a team, to get them properly motivated, to set up all the systems, etc., and my initial idea - and I didn't know how the NAMA thing was going to develop at this stage - my initial idea was that if it came through the NTMA to run, maybe we could do it in the same way as we did with some of the other things we had.  You know, we had the NDFA, we had State Claims Agency, etc., and that maybe we could get a small number of people, perhaps 30 or 40 people, and get the banks to do the donkey work and we would oversee them, and pressurise them to, effectively, get the money back, because that was my first thought, you know, they, they probably have commitments to, to people, property developers.  And, I, I was shocked when I saw the level of loans that were out.  But, that they could pressurise people to get the money back.  I mean, they're well capable of pressurising people who owe them money to come back with it, whereas trying to set up a new NAMA unit. it didn't seem to me to be the optical solution.  Now, I accept I could have been wrong on that because I think, well, okay, if they have it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#YYY00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":2815,"content":"<p>Finally, Dr. Somers, can you explain why the Minister for Finance which would have been Brian Lenihan requested you to visit Jean-Claude Trichet, given that the Minister would have had regular contact with Mr. Trichet and his officials?

The way NAMA was developing, it looked as though they were going to need &euro;60 billion funding to buy the loans off the banks.  I knew Mr. Trichet for very many years because I had been on various committees with him and I knew him from the 1980s.  We had been on the EU monetary committee and we were involved with setting up the EBRD, etc., and I knew him reasonably well on a personal basis.<br\/><br\/>The Minister approached me about it, he said, &quot;Would you go and talk to Mr. Trichet and tell him we need &euro;60 billion?&quot;  So I said to him, &quot;Would it not be more appropriate for the Central Bank or the Department of Finance to do it?&quot;  And he said &quot;Would you go and do it you know him?&quot;  So I said &quot;Okay I'll go and do it.&quot;  So I arranged it anyway, I got my PA to ring Mr. Trichet's office and said &quot;Look I'd like to go out and see him.&quot;  I don't think we said what exactly I wanted and he said &quot;Yes that's fine.&quot;  And I arranged to go out and see him I think it was about March 2009.  I have the date here somewhere.<br\/><br\/>But that information got out to the Central Bank who were I think quite perturbed about it.  They and the Department of Finance insisted on accompanying me out to see Mr. Trichet.  The thing became a bit bizarre after that.  I think there were two from the Central Bank - the Governor and the head of the director general and I think it was Kevin Cardiff from the Department of Finance.  They went out themselves and I went out on a separate plane.  For the life of me I can't remember why.  We went into the ECB building and it became a bit fuzzy but they arranged that we would meet some officials from the ECB and what surprised me was the length of time that the Central Bank people took in trying to explain our situation to the ECB people.  I thought that they would be in regular contact and they would be way up to speed.  Then at some stage or other I said, &quot;What about meeting Mr. Trichet?&quot;  And I was told Mr. Trichet is not available.  So I thought that was very strange.  So I phoned back to my PA in Dublin and I said &quot;Would you ever ring Jean-Claude's office and find out what's going on here, I am supposed to see him?&quot;  So she contacted them anyway and she came back and she said &quot;Oh yeah no, he is available to see you at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock&quot;, - whatever the time was.<br\/><br\/>Anyway, it was coming up to that time and I said &quot;Where does the president sit?&quot;  So the Governor of the Central Bank insisted on coming with me and we went in to see Jean-Claude Trichet.  As I say I knew him well, I was on first name terms with him.  I was quite surprised that the Governor was not on first-name terms with <i>Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident<\/i>etc., and I would have thought they would have had a closer relationship.

The hope was, I suppose, that confidence would return to the markets and that the interbank market might start functioning again.  But the difficulty was that we weren't the only country that was doing this.  I mean the general attitude of people who had money, surplus cash, instead of putting into the interbank market was to take it out and put it into local, central banks.  And then that of course, resulted in a huge squeeze on liquidity and money just wasn't available anymore.  Now, was that our problem?  My attitude was that's not our problem.  You know, we all look after what we're obliged to look after and the central banks can recycle the money and ... now, central banks were not very good at recycling the money, but there was no particular reason why they couldn't do it.

Because, as I say, I felt that they knew where the bodies were all buried - we didn't.  And we needed to put together a team to do this work and we didn't have a readily available team to do it, whereas the banks did have this team.  And I felt that they'd created the problem.  They knew what the problem was, they knew where the ... as I say, where the bodies were buried.  They knew the individuals they were dealing with and I felt that they should sort it out.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the discount, I mean, there's no absolute value for anything.  The price of anything ... the value of something is what somebody's prepared to pay you and if there's no money around, of course, the value of a product, whether its a house or a piece of land or whatever, is going to fall.  So, in terms of the NAMA discount, I suppose I would have thought to myself, well ... I knew Brendan but I don't know if I said to anybody, \"He's going to cover his back - he's going to impose whatever discount he feels is necessary to make sure that he, at the end of the day, doesn't end up showing a loss.\"  And if I was in his position, I would have done the same thing.  Now, whether they had the correct discounts or not, I don't know.  I mean, I ended up then on the other side of the field as the State director with AIB and I was looking at this ... these discounts and I said, \"God, these are enormous discounts.  Are these justified?\"  And, of course, they were saying, \"Well, they're not.\"  And I said, \"Well, why don't you challenge them then?\"  And they said, \"Well, we can't challenge them [I think] 'til the whole process is finished.\"  And I think they felt they were not going to win anyway.  But that was it.  And the problem was the discounts then, of course, impinged on the capital of the banks and we ended up then in a situation where, okay, NAMA was not going to make a loss but, on the other hand, the banks had to be recapitalised by the State, so we put it into one pocket and took it out of another pocket and handed it back to the banks to recapitalise them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#CCCC00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":2878,"content":"<p>And can I ask you about the &euro;42 billion discount?

He has &euro;1.6 billion in CoCos, these convertible shares, which he's getting 10% on, that's &euro;160 million.  So that's 400 and something million per year that he can get in interest out of the bank.  Now, the bank is supposed to be worth &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion.  It's not my decision, by the way, but if it was ... if I sold the bank ... and you sell it in a tranche, say, you sell 25% of the thing, you're going to have to sell it at a discount because people are not going to pay you the full value for, you know, the shares where the State is still a 75% shareholder, so you're going to have to ... because they don't know what you're going to do.  So you're going to have to sell at a discount, so you're not going to get full value there.  Now, as you sell further tranches, I suppose you'd get a bit more value.  But even if you were to, say, to sell the whole lot today and you got, say, &euro;12 billion, the ... as I understand it, the only thing you can do with that money is use it to pay down the national debt, you can't actually use it to spend on, you know, worthwhile projects.  Now, if you use it to pay down the national debt, well, I think the ten-year rate on Irish Government bonds is about 1.7%.  So that's just over &euro;200 million that you'll save on interest payments on the national debt.  However, if you don't do that, you can collect 400 and something million per year in interest, which you can do what you like with.

Why ... what was our pay model?  When the NTMA was set up, it was set up because we could not hold staff.  By the way, I was secretary of the Department of Defence.  I was enjoying myself over there, you know, it was a boy scout's dream - best job I ever had.  The Government changed in 1987 and I was hauled back to the Department of Finance to, as Mr. Haughey said it, you know, he knew something about financial affairs, we've got to get this scene in order.  Now, you actually couldn't get staff into the place on the pay rates and you ... anybody who knew anything about the financial affairs then left, they went off to brokers, banks, whatever.  They left.  We were playing against the best in the world.  We were borrowing in every currency that you could imagine because we had Irish pounds, you couldn't borrow very much in Irish pounds, we were borrowing Kuwaiti dinar, dirhams, yen - everything.  It was quite a tricky business because you had to have some knowledge of the capital markets of the world and we did not have that expertise in the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  So we were playing against the Goldman Sachses and the Merrill Lynches and everything else and the general view was we were losing.  That we were not getting the best deals.  And the Government of the day said, \"Okay, if you can't beat them join them.  We'll set up the NTMA.\"  And Albert Reynolds was very clear about this in the D&aacute;il, that, \"We'll pay whatever it takes to get the best because no matter what we pay people, it's still a fraction of what you can gain or lose by a good decision compared to a bad decision.\"  So I hired people in on the basis of a basic rate of pay and a performance-related bonus and a car and, I think, VHI.  Now the car, because of the BIK thing was a questionable thing.  And we hired people in and we, you know, we got the debt, I think, under control - at lease we got the interest bill under control.  And gradually, then ... I was approached by Dermot Gleeson then, who was the Attorney General, and he said to me that the whole question of people suing the State had got out of control.  We had the question of the Army, I think virtually the whole Army sued for deafness and it was not well handled.  And there were other cases coming up - I mean, there was asbestosis and all kinds of things coming up - and he came over to me and he said, \"Could you fellas set up some sort of an organisation that would pay people and not have the State ripped off?\", because he said he saw it on both sides; he saw it, you know, claiming on behalf of people and then, as Attorney General, trying to defend the cases.

See, we always maintained as much cash as we could because I saw what happened to the South American republics in the 1980s.  They were not in the high ... they were nothing like as indebted as we were.  But the problem they ran into was one of liquidity.  They left their ... they didn't pre-pay loans or anything.  So ... and when a year would come up, they'd have not only the borrowing requirement for that year to meet but they'd also have all the repayments of loans in that year.  Now, we saw what happened to them so our policy was ... sorry, I'm digressing slightly but just to try and answer the question for you.   Our ... we used to try and pre-pay loans one to two years before they matured so that, say in year ten, when that came up, we would have actually pre-paid that loan in year eight.  So when it came to year ten, all we seemed to have to do was to borrow for the borrowing requirement of that year and maybe not even that much because we would have pre-borrowed.  And then in that year, we'd say, \"Okay, all we need is the money for this year or some of the money for this year\", but we would also, without necessarily advertising the thing, borrow other money and we'd try and pre-pay other loans that were coming up in the next couple of years so that we didn't get hit for any huge amount of repayments in any particular year.  So the result was, we built up a pot of cash and that cost us money because we had to pay interest on it.

That was the bogeyman that we held up, \"Listen, if you don't behave yourselves and get your finances under control, the next thing is well have the IMF in here running the show for us.\"  So, for me, I felt it was the ultimate humiliation actually for us, as a country, to have the IMF come in to run the show for us.  Why did it happen?  You know, we had three years warning of this thing.  This all started in 2007 ... August 2007.  And the bailout thing eventually occurred in ... three years later in 2010.  And you'd say to yourself, \"Well, could we have got our act together better?  Could we have sold ourselves better or whatever in the meantime?\"  I mean, we had been ... my colleagues and I, we had been through worse crises in the 1980s where our debt was enormous and, you know, we go through it.  We tapped every bank in the world for a few bob and none of them knew that we'd tapped the other fellas.  So we'd a vast number of very small loans and suddenly we'd a big load of cash.

And I tried to persuade the Minister, and I failed on this, say, \"Look, could we start with a few loans or something and see would that solve the problem.  Why do we have to take everything from them?  Or why can't we just, you know, get the banks to solve the thing and get them to pull in these loans that they've extended?  Why do we have to do this?  They created the problem and force them to do something about it.\"  He didn't seem to have an appetite for that.  I mean, he ... the whole Peter Bacon project ... he had met Peter Bacon somewhere or other, who had told him about this, kind of, project and he then rang me and said would I hire Peter Bacon, negotiate it with him, provide him with a room, etc., to produce a report to give him.  And Peter Bacon produced this thing very fast.  I thought actually, myself, that it would be turned down by the Department of Finance, because the one thing the Department of Finance were very good at was turning down things and I reckoned this would never get past them.  But it did and suddenly it became Government policy and it took legs.  And suddenly here we were with this thing and it was, kind of, semi-frightening that ... you know, that we were going to take on this huge liability and hand over all this money to the banks and I tried to see could I slow it down because, well, I never saw the likes of it before.
