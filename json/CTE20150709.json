I'm happy to be here with you this morning to assist you in whatever way I can in your important endeavour.  You have my written statement, which I'm happy to take as read, but before moving on to questions I'd like to make a brief few points about the nature of my work for the late Brian Lenihan.<\/p><p>As you said, Chairman, I was special adviser throughout his time in the Department of Finance.  Committee members may know that the legal definition of the role of special adviser is quite broad, and that the Minister to whom the adviser is accountable essentially writes his or her job spec.  In my case, my main duty was to advise Brian Lenihan on the communication of Government actions and decisions taken during the crisis, most of which were complex and difficult.  Throughout the crisis he was acutely conscious of the need to explain to the citizens the reasons for Government actions and the outcomes they were designed to achieve.  His specific objective was to tell the public what went wrong, what the Government was going to do about it and what the outcome of their actions would be.  To achieve that objective, I worked closely with officials in the Department of Finance, drafting and providing speeches, providing briefing for Oireachtas debates, drafting articles for print media and advising on media strategy.  The particular job assigned to me by the then Minister was to work with officials and political colleagues in other Departments of the Government's response to the fiscal crisis.  Between mid-2008 and April 2011, Brian Lenihan introduced six separate sets of budget correction and in his constant battle to stabilise the public finances.  The banking crisis was a separate theatre of battle and initially I had no involvement at all in this area of the Minister's work.  Because of its highly confidential nature, particularly in the months before the guarantee, discussion relating to the banks was necessarily held tightly by a very small group of officials.  I had no role in any banking policy formulation during that period and I have no recollection of receiving any direct information about the banking matters.<\/p><p> After the guarantee, my involvement in the banking side revolved around the communication of the actions and decisions that the Government had to take to rescue the banks.  I contributed to the drafting of speeches and I worked closely with colleagues in the press office preparing for media interviews and responding to the very significant number of media queries relating to the financial crisis in Ireland.  The Minister didn't ask me to play any role in the formulation of banking policy or to attend any banking meetings about decisions relating to the banks.  He did ask me, along with his press officer, to go to Government Buildings on the night of the guarantee, so that we would be fully briefed for what media announcements might arise from the discussions that were taking place that night.  I played no part in those discussions and spent the night with other colleagues from the Taoiseach's office in adjoining offices.  Mr. Chairman, in my written statement I have drawn on all the knowledge and information I have been able to assemble, much of it acquired after the events which the Committee has asked me to address.  Seven years on from the onset of the crisis, I can't now definitively distinguish between my real-time knowledge of events and what I subsequently learned about them and I'd ask the Committee to bear the possible distorting impact of this in mind when assessing the information contained in that submission.  I'm happy to take your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Herbert","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening remarks, Ms Herbert, and if I can invite our first member this morning to ask questions, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#E00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

Good morning, Chairman, and inquiry members.  I have furnished the committee with a written statement in accordance with a request made to me.  I don't intend to quote from this statement but will welcome the opportunity to make some additional comments to the inquiry.<\/p> <p>  It may be of assistance if I begin by providing the committee with a short introduction of myself so that I may outline my financial background and experience.  In 1970 I graduated from University College Dublin with a bachelor of commerce degree.  Subsequently I trained at Cooper Brothers and Co., now known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973.<\/p><p>While at Cooper Brothers and Co., I worked in their tax department.  In 1975 I successfully applied to the Civil Service Commission and became an inspector of taxes, where I stayed for six years.  In August 1981 I was made a tax partner at John Woods and Co., now known as Grant Thornton.  In May 1986 I formed Quinlan Ryan, a small chartered accountancy firm, with two partners, and the firm remained in existence for three years.  In May 1989 I commenced trading as a chartered accountant under the title &quot;Derek M. Quinlan, Chartered Accountant&quot;.  In 1990 I put together a deal to purchase a number of units in the recently opened Square shopping centre in Tallaght, Dublin.  This was my first significant property deal on behalf of clients.  Other significant investments took place during the 1990s, including an investment of approximately &euro;250 million in the IFSC.<br\/><br\/>The committee will have noted from my statement that I refer to the ... the activities of Quinlan Private, as I was asked to provide a statement regarding my company.  I believe it is important to note that I would have personally invested in a large number of the investments put together by Quinlan Private.  I would also have invested personally in other investments.  The committee has, I'm sure, at this stage heard from other witnesses that, with hindsight, the growth in the Irish property market from 2001 to 2008 was enormous.  It is now clear, for a number of reasons that were then unknown to me - and, I believe, to the majority of people at that time - that this growth was unsustainable.  I genuinely did not believe that the market was in danger of collapse until I heard of the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion there are three key areas which I feel are important in the context of the inquiry.  During the period 2002 to 2007 there was a huge &quot;feel good&quot; factor in play in Ireland and most people bought into this reality, including myself.  There were very few opposing views.  This was just not an Irish phenomenon, it was actually international.  In his book <i>The Map and the Territory<\/i>, published in 2014, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the American Federal Reserve said:<blockquote>The Federal Reserve['s] ... highly sophisticated forecasting system did not foresee a recession until the crisis hit.  Nor [he continued] did the [...] forecasting model developed by the [...] [IMF], which concluded as late as spring 2007 that [the] &quot;[...] economic risks had declined since September 2006 [and that] [...] signs everywhere were encouraging.&quot;<\/blockquote>The second point I'd like to make, I did not realise that the long-term bank finance being provided by the Irish banks was being funded on short-term borrowings from international banks and others.  This model was clearly not sustainable.  If I had known this at the time, I certainly would not have invested in Irish property.  Finally, I was not aware - and I believe that most people were not aware - of what was going on internationally with sub-prime lending in the United States.  This had, I believe, a huge impact on both the Irish and international banking sector, as liquidity dried up in a very short period of time.<br\/><br\/>I believe it's important to note that Quinlan Private invested in quality commercial properties.  These were in prime locations.  I have a fundamental philosophy in relation to property investment which is based on four main tenets: location; timing; liquidity; and confidence.  It is clear, in Ireland, that, at the one time, all of these factors were decimated.  I did not foresee this.  I don't believe it would have been reasonable to do so.  Neither the Irish banks nor the Ministers of finance nor the Economic and Social Research Institute knew that the banking crisis was imminent.  Rather, all parties envisaged a very bright future for the Irish economy and the Government of the day continued with high expenditure to fit in with that forecast.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by taking this opportunity to state that I am deeply saddened at the fallout from the banking crisis.  I recognise that, for a very large number of people in Ireland, it has had an unprecedented and devastating impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#W00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Quinlan.

An annual growth rate of 20% is often taken as a trigger.  Each of the locally controlled banks had at least one year in which this threshold was triggered.  One of them Anglo crossed it eight out of nine years and indeed this average annual growth rate was 36% from 1998 to 2007.<\/blockquote>And other witnesses here reference alarm at that level of growth.

Good afternoon, Chairman, and inquiry members.  In this brief opening statement, you have asked me to address from my perspective as the finance director of the NTMA during 2007 and 2008, the following lines of inquiry: appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector; adequacy of the assessment of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision; and appropriateness of any expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, banking and the property sector and adequacy of assessment of solvency and liquidity risks.  As advised to the inquiry's investigation team in advance of this submission, in my position as NTMA director of finance, I have no particular insights in the nature of relationships between the Government, the wider political system and the banking and property sectors up to 2008 and therefore I do not believe I am qualified to comment on or add to the first-hand testimony on this topic that has already been provided to the inquiry by other witnesses.  I am not that well-positioned to opine on the adequacy of the assessment of solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions because I had no roles in assessing that back in 2007 and 2008.  That was ultimately a role for the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  The NTMA had no special insight into the banks, domestically or internationally.  All we had were publicly available documents such as credit agency reports, market updates and reports and broker analyst reports.  Not surprisingly, by reference to this published material from somewhat respected and financially literate commentators from 2005 to 2007, one could conclude that, while there were risks, there were no strong warning signals of the financial carnage that would ultimately emerge.  <br\/><br\/>By late 2007, however, although we at the NTMA had no inside information about any bank domestically or internationally, we began to sense that there were early signs of market dislocation beginning to emerge in the capital and money markets.  The first hedge funds failed in early August 2007, followed by regular market rumours about the fragility of various international banks and the unsettling sight of queues of depositors at Northern Rock branches in September 2007.  This caused us at the NTMA to adopt a conservative view of managing the State&rsquo;s cash assets which were raised in the main to fund the national debt.  We had no idea at that stage of the global reach of the credit crisis or of how long it would last or of how serious it would become.<br\/><br\/>As I previously advised the inquiry, we were always sceptical of the business models of at least two Irish financial institutions, Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank, particularly their heavy exposure to property lending and the limited distribution access of Anglo Irish Bank which had no branch network.  We had no credit limit for INBS so we did not do business with them and we restricted our credit limit to &euro;40 million for Anglo Irish Bank even before the crisis started to emerge in 2007.  However, from August 2007 we considered it prudent to reduce our counter-party credit limit exposure to the bank deposit market globally until a clearer picture would emerge.  At that time, it was not an easy decision to justify as all we had was an uneasy sense that the whole global banking and capital market system was more fragile than appeared on the surface, but we had little by way of specific evidence.  Ultimately, things got a lot worse as the months passed and our August 2007 decision proved to be the correct one although it would be a year later before major bank difficulties became more generally visible.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  In relation to other lines of inquiry, it is my understanding from discussion with your investigation team that you wish me to focus in my remarks on the period from mid-2007 to September 2008.  As I advised the inquiry in April this year, there was no substantive discussion involving myself - and as far as I am aware with my senior NTMA colleagues - about a bank guarantee in the months, weeks or days leading up to 30 September 2008 and the NTMA had no involvement in the actual decision to introduce the blanket guarantee.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Hurley, in his evidence, referred to a note prepared by the Department of Finance of an 18 September 2008 meeting at which Dr. Somers, Mr. Corrigan and I were recorded as being present at which, Mr. Hurley states, a guarantee was discussed.  My recollection, which is confirmed by the Department&rsquo;s meeting note, is that the discussion was purely about a deposit<i><\/i>guarantee, not a blanket<i><\/i>guarantee, and that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator did not even favour such an approach at that meeting.  The meeting mainly centred on the merits of increasing the deposit guarantee for individuals from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  For the record, I believe the meeting was actually held on Friday, 19 September not 18 September but that is incidental.<br\/><br\/>Whilst my colleague, Mr, Whelan, and I were in Government Buildings on the night of 29 September, we were not, as I have previously advised, made aware as to the reason why we were there .... why we were required or consulted or otherwise asked to input prior to the Government taking the guarantee decision.  Once the Government had decided to introduce a blanket guarantee, my focus and that of Mr. Whelan as public servants was, and you will appreciate, on the implications of that decision and its effect on the NTMA as the State&rsquo;s debt manager and, more immediately, on how the NTMA would deal with the market and credit rating agency reaction to the decision at 7 a.m. that very morning.<br\/><br\/>As the banking crisis unfolded in the two weeks immediately before 30 September 2008, the NTMA's engagement with the Department of Finance had focused on three main strands.<\/p><p>The first strand was the provision of secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, if so directed by the Minister, second, the NTMA input into draft legislation dealing with the possible nationalisation of two financial institutions, a building society draft nationalisation Bill and a bank draft nationalisation Bill and three, the NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch on 24 September on behalf of the Minister for Finance to provide advice.<br\/><br\/>On the first issue on discussions and secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, the NTMA had in fact been engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance from April 2008 about the provision of emergency liquidity in circumstances where the Irish banks could not meet their funding requirements from the wholesale markets.  This was separate to the engagement we'd been having with the Department of Finance from the summer of 2007 in relation to the NTMA placement of bank deposits, which I will deal with later.  By September 2008, these discussions had intensified and the NTMA had in place arrangements to allow it, in the event that it was directed by the Minister, to engage in emergency collateralised lending to the Irish banks.  I estimate that we had about &euro;5 billion in liquidity available at that time, across various mandates that could be lent up to one year.  The NTMA had been maintaining a floor to its liquidity and allowed it to supply a certain amount of emergency funding requirements but only if directed by the Minister.  There had also been discussion about the NTMA accumulating a war chest of liquidity to deal with the emerging banking liquidity crisis.  However, while the NTMA was continuing to issue commercial paper of up to &euro;20 billion, which was as long-dated as possible, with a maximum 12-month maturity, it was clear that there was no appetite from longer-term bond market investors to invest on the scale needed to create a cash buffer to deal with even part of the potential fallout from the banks.  This was particularly the case given the pressures the sovereign was already experience in terms of funding the national debt during 2008, which was &euro;50 billion approximately. <br\/><br\/>NTMA&rsquo;s input into the bank ... draft bank and building society nationalisation legislation: our input into draft legislation being prepared during September 2008 by the Department of Finance to deal with the possible nationalisation of a building society and of a bank related mainly to the role the NTMA could play in providing restructuring assistance post-nationalisation and technical advices on obligations arising under the Companies Act, which could potentially limit the Minister&rsquo;s power to manage a nationalised institution.<br\/><br\/>Three, the NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch to advise the Minister for Finance.: the NTMA engaged Merrill Lynch on 24 September but we were not prepared to enter into a contract with them without the Minister&rsquo;s approval.  On 26 September 2008, Secretary General Department of Finance, Mr. Cardiff, confirmed in an e-mail to me that the Minister was instructing the NTMA to engage Merrill Lynch to provide corporate finance advice to him.  I understand that Merrill Lynch met the Minister and senior officials within his Department, including Mr. Doyle and Mr. Cardiff, to discuss strategic options that evening.  I will discuss the quality of the expert advice later in my opening comments.<br\/><br\/>NTMA knowledge of a blanket bank guarantee: the first and only reference to a blanket bank guarantee throughout all the engagement in September 2008 was an e-mail that I received from Mr. Beausang, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance, at 1.26 p.m. on Friday, 26 September 2008.  The e-mail, issued on the instruction of the Secretary General, sought the NTMA&rsquo;s view on, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the potential sovereign implications of a blanket bank guarantee.  I responded that afternoon at 2.22 p.m. after receiving a phone call from Mr. Beausang in which he sought an urgent response to the Department&rsquo;s ... for the Department's Secretary General.  Without having much time to consider the matter, I discussed it with my colleague, Mr. Whelan, and in my reply to Mr. Beausang, I pointed out that the real exposures to the Exchequer from the banking system had not yet been independently qualified ... quantified, and that would make any assessment of a bank guarantee extremely difficult.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s e-mail to me referred to a possible total funding requirement of approximately &euro;100 billion for the two institutions expected to be nationalised, as estimated by Merrill Lynch, and also a wider guarantee for the other institutions.  I pointed out that, in the event of such a major decision being made, the credit ratings agencies would &quot;be taken aback&quot; at the scale of the State involvement that a blanket guarantee would necessitate and that there would be an immediate credit ratings downgrade of Ireland from AAA and a concomitant rise in the cost of funding the national debt.  I also made the observation that, given the potential size of any guarantee relative to the size of the economy, Ireland could &quot;expect to pay a lot more than Greece<i>&quot; <\/i>in the international money markets.  Greece, as you know, was an outlier at that time in terms of bond yield spreads at about 75 basis points in the ten-year maturity over Germany; Ireland was about 45 basis points, I recall.  There was no follow-up from the Department to my e-mail.<br\/><br\/>NTMA deposit placement: prior to September 2008, engagement between the NTMA and the Department of Finance related primarily to the NTMA&rsquo;s placement of bank deposits.  This reflected the view in many quarters that the problem in the banking system domestically was one of liquidity, not solvency.  By August 2007, the NTMA had made the decision firstly to reduce existing counterparty credit lines with a range of global financial institutions and to stop placing deposits with any bank.  The NTMA policy was to move maturing deposits back to the Central Bank of Ireland &ndash; we referred to it internally as safe-harbouring deposits.  The Department of Finance was fully aware of the NTMA&rsquo;s position in this regard.  The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Doyle, was a member of the NTMA advisory committee, which received updates from me, as finance director, on the NTMA&rsquo;s counterparty credit limit policy and counterparty credit list at its September and December 2007 meetings, and this continued throughout 2008.  I recall at these meetings that Mr. Doyle, as a member of the NTMA advisory committee, did not agree with the NTMA&rsquo;s position on deposit placements and safe-harbouring at the Central Bank but the overall advisory committee agreed with the NTMA senior management&rsquo;s position and consistently advised us to take a conservative and prudent approach to counterparty risk.<br\/><br\/>In mid-December 2007, the NTMA was invited to the latter stages of a domestic standing group meeting with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to discuss the placing of deposits within existing credit limits with Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million, AIB, &euro;200 million, Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;50 million and EBS, &euro;50 million. An existing deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank, with a maturity of one year, had been in place before the NTMA made its decision to cease placing the deposits with the banks and to place them instead with the Central Bank.  The NTMA&rsquo;s position at this meeting, which took place, I believe on 12 December 2007, was that, in the absence of a written direction from the Minister, we did not intend reversing this policy of placing bank deposits in financial institutions.  We made the point at the meeting that, if anything, the risks attaching to the banking system, internationally as well as domestically, had become even more pronounced since the original August 2007 decision of the NTMA to safe-harbour<i><\/i>maturing deposits with the Central Bank.  Following that meeting, the Minister for Finance at the time, Mr. Cowen, wrote to the chief executive of the NTMA, Dr. Somers, on 19 December 2007, directing the NTMA to place deposits with the four main banks, namely, Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS.  The Minister also sought proposals for additional NTMA activity within financial markets and the expansion of NTMA credit lines <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>banks.I have already referred to our subsequent engagement in 2008, particularly in September 2008, with the Minister and the Department on these two points.  My colleague, Mr. Whelan wrote to the second Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Cardiff, also on 19 December 2007, seeking clarification that the Minister&rsquo;s correspondence constituted a direction under section 4(4) of the NTMA Act 1990.  Mr. Cardiff confirmed on behalf of the Minister, in correspondence on 21 December 2007, that this was the case.  As regards maturities, Mr. Cardiff added, &quot;The intention is to leave appropriate discretion to yourselves, but the aim should be to considerably in excess of one month and preferably towards three months,&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>The NTMA wrote again to the Department of Finance, by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff, on 18 February and 18 April 2008, respectively, seeking clarification as to whether the Minister&rsquo;s direction of 19 December 2007 applied to the roll-over of maturing deposits with Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS. Mr. Cardiff responded on both occasions to confirm that the Minister&rsquo;s direction did so apply and all deposits should be renewed on maturity.  On 17 June 2008, the new Minister for Finance, Mr. Lenihan, in correspondence to Dr. Somers, directed the roll-over of Bank of Ireland and AIB deposits on an unsecured basis and an increase in deposit sizes with Irish Life and Permanent from &euro;50 million to &euro;250 million and EBS from &euro;40 million to &euro;100 million, on a secured collateralised basis.  In correspondence to the Minister on 27 June 2008, Dr. Somers confirmed the placement of deposit funds in the Irish market as follows: Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months, AIB, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months, Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;250 million collateralised deposit for 12 months, EBS, &euro;100 million collateralised deposit for 12 months.  The NTMA chief executive also advised that the NTMA did not intend to renew a one-year unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank which fell due on 8 August 2008, as the deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s December 2007 direction.  On 17 July 2008, I wrote by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff to again advise that an unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank would mature on 8 August 2008 and asked whether the Minister intended to direct<i><\/i>the NTMA to renew the deposit.  As advised in the NTMA's chief executive&rsquo;s earlier correspondence to the Minister, it was the NTMA&rsquo;s view that Anglo Irish deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s 2007 direction and the NTMA&rsquo;s position is that it did not intend to renew the deposit.  Mr. Cardiff wrote to me on behalf of the Minister directing the NTMA to place a &euro;40 million one-year collateralised deposit with Anglo Irish Bank and to roll over the NTMA&rsquo;s &euro;200 million deposits with Bank of Ireland and AIB on a six-month collateralised basis.<\/p><p>On 25 July 2008, I wrote to Mr. Cardiff to advise him that Anglo Irish Bank was not interested in doing a deal on a collateralised basis especially for only &euro;40 million, and had requested instead that the NTMA renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on an unsecured one-year basis.  Mr. Cardiff advised, on 28 July 2008, that Mr. Cardiff wished the NTMA to renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on a three-monthly maturity.  There could have been no ambiguity at any time during this period on the part of senior Department of Finance officials or the Minister for Finance as to the NTMA's position on global bank risk from August 2007 and our reluctance, given the increasing dislocation of financial markets, to put at risk any State money under our management by placing it on deposit with domestic or international financial institutions unless we were directed to do so by the Minister for Finance.  <br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used: From mid-September 2008, when my colleagues, Mr. Corrigan, Mr. Whelan and I were requested to attend meetings which the Department of Finance had scheduled with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, it was obvious to me and also, I believe, to my colleagues, that there was a dearth of information or analysis available in terms of real insight as to the financial state of the domestic banks and building societies.  It surprised us that there appeared to be only one or, at most, two Financial Regulator staff engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution, even those institutions with balance sheets of up to &euro;200 billion.  At one particular meeting at the outset of the evolving crisis, Mr. Neary, the Financial Regulator, inquired as to the <i>locus standi<\/i>of NTMA officials at these meetings given banking confidentiality issues.  Mr. Cardiff dealt with this and advised that the NTMA had been requested to attend and provide advice to the Department of Finance by the Minister himself.  Each of the financial institutions in late September 2008 were beginning to retain investment banks as advisers.  A decision was taken by the Minister that the State needed its own investment bank to advise it and the NTMA requested to engage that advice and this was arranged by my colleague, Mr. Corrigan.<br\/><br\/>During the last two weeks of September 2008, the whole focus was on having legislation ready to nationalise a building society and a bank, if required.  The NTMA provided technical input into that draft legislation.  A separate piece of legislation was also being prepared by the Department of Finance and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office which would enable the NTMA and the Central Bank to provide secured lending to the financial institutions.  <br\/><br\/>Considerable pressure was being applied at the September 2008 Department of Finance-Central Bank-Financial Regulator meetings on the NTMA to increase the amount of deposits placed with the Irish banking system as Irish institutions rapidly began to lose liquidity.  The NTMA refused and advised it was our view of our chief executive, Dr. Somers, that it was the role of the Central Bank to be the lender of last resort; it was not the role of the NTMA as a debt management agency.  This caused considerable tension but we maintained our position.  <br\/><br\/>Merrill Lynch was in place for about four days before the guarantee decision was made.  In my view, it was only after that guarantee decision was made and through the work of PwC on behalf of the Financial Regulator, and the work of Merrill Lynch after the guarantee decision, that the real picture began to emerge of what was really going on in the Irish banking system and the scale of property and other lending.  That emerging picture of asset and liability mismatch based on the PwC-Merrill Lynch work from mid-October 2008 onwards was very alarming.  Excessive lending by financial institutions funded by short-term wholesale deposits, which were disappearing rapidly, with the result that liquidity from the Central Bank and the ECB was required and capital injections were inevitable.  The ECB then, unlike today, was not very accommodative in terms of the type of collateral it would accept from the banks.  By then, the damage had been done.  <br\/><br\/>During the autumn of 2008 and the early part of 2009, I continued to perform my full-time role as NTMA finance director while also attempting, on almost a full-time basis, to assist the Department of Finance and my senior NTMA colleagues in its efforts to deal with the possible collapse of the Irish banking system and the direct effect on Ireland as the sovereign.  <br\/><br\/>Subsequent to the period that we have just discussed, my professional responsibilities within the NTMA shifted to the establishment of NAMA from May 2009 and, as you know, I've already provided the inquiry with evidence as regards the NAMA experience.  I hope that in these brief opening comments, I have given you a sense of my engagement and that of the NTMA and the Department of Finance and Minister for Finance during 2007 and 2008.  Thank you, Chairman. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McDonagh.

And of course, the position was maintained by all the banks in the autumn of 2008 that they were fine, they didn't need capital.  If they did need capital they needed a small amount of capital.  They'd only take capital if another institution took capital - this sort of silly game-playing was going on.  And they'd source capital from third parties if they needed to.

I have been asked to provide a statement to the inquiry covering 24 lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I was appointed to that position on 3 December 1990, for a period of five years by the Minister for Finance and was re-appointed several times, finally retiring on 3 December 2009.  I had previously been Secretary General, national debt management, in the Department of Finance from April 1987 and before that, I was Secretary General of Department of Defence from February 1985.  I served at various levels in the Department of Finance, initially in the pensions section and later in the finance division.  I also spent a period of just under two years in the Central Bank up to 1970.<\/p> <p>  As I was largely responsible for the establishment of the NTMA and its growing range of functions over 19 years, I would like to outline the rationale for its rather unique structure and how it operated.  The reason for the establishment of the NTMA was the very heavy burden of the national debt at the end of the 1980s and the absence of suitably-qualified personnel in the Department of Finance to deal with the complex issue of raising funds on the international capital markets at optimum rates of interest.  The then Minister for Finance, speaking on the NTMA Bill before the D&aacute;il in 1990, said the debt was one of the highest in the OECD at over 120% of GNP at end 1989, while interest payments were put in 1990 at 9% of GNP, which he said was almost equivalent to the total yield from income tax in the PAYE sector.  He continued that it was about 60% greater than total Exchequer expenditure on the health services.<\/p> <p>  The powers of the NTMA were very strictly circumscribed by legislation and related to the delegation of powers of the Minister for Finance to borrow money to fund the Exchequer.  The NTMA had no power to provide any assistance to the banking sector and would have been acting outside its remit, and probably in breach of EU law, to have done so by its own decision.  The following paragraphs set out the carefully designed legal basis on which it was established and operated.  When funds were being raised abroad and legal documents had to be signed, it was generally done by officials of the Department of Finance acting on the basis of a signed and sealed power of attorney, given by the Minister for Finance.  It would have been completely impracticable for the Minister to personally negotiate and execute all the documentation relating to loans raised throughout the world.  Nevertheless, questions had been raised, generally by Irish lawyers, about the legitimacy of this procedure on the basis that the Minister could not delegate his power to a civil servant.  There could have been some validity in this argument.  It was felt unwise to see it legally tested as, if found to be wrong, it would have created an impossible situation in the absence of some complex legislative change.<\/p> <p>  However, when the creation of the NTMA was being considered, it was essential that this issue be resolved as there was no room for questioning the legal capacity of the NTMA to enter into contracts binding the State for very large financial commitments.  Also, it was not intended the NTMA would be required to obtain a separate power of attorney from the Minister for Finance for every transaction undertaken &ndash; a situation that, as mentioned earlier, could be legally challenged anyway.<\/p> <p>  In summary, therefore, the creation of the NTMA raised constitutional issues as the functions which it would be called upon to perform were part of the executive power of the State.  That power can only be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.  It was felt that if the borrowing of money for the Exchequer and the management of the national debt were taken away from the Minister for Finance, it could be questioned as to whether he was still Minister for Finance.  It was, however, recognised that the Government could delegate the functions of a Minister to a Minister of State, while still retaining the power to exercise those functions himself or herself.<\/p> <p>  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas provided the NTMA would be established as a body to perform, on the authority of the Government, the functions delegated to it by the Government under the Act, at that time principally borrowing and debt management.  In effect it was established as a type of corporate Minister of State.  The Government would delegate to it certain functions of the Minister for Finance.  These would be performed, subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister and subject to such guidelines and directions as he would give it.  The chief executive would be appointed by the Minister and be directly responsible, i.e. not through a Department, to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.  The chief executive, who could not be a civil servant, would be answerable to the D&aacute;il Public Accounts Committee.<\/p> <p>  Because of the importance of the NTMA&rsquo;s functions as part of the executive power of the State, it was further determined that there could not be a board of directors, as with a State body, because this would diffuse responsibility to an unacceptable degree.  Instead, there would be an advisory committee to assist and advise the agency on whatever it might request and be consulted by the Minister on the terms and conditions of appointment of the chief executive.<\/p><p>The above arrangements applied throughout my period as chief executive of the NTMA.  They were, however, fundamentally changed by the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, but these changes are not relevant to my statement.<\/p><p> I would like to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the evidence that my colleagues and I gave to the public accounts committee on 14 May 2009, over a period of about four hours.  This covered, quite comprehensively, what the NTMA knew about the banking crisis at the time and the actions it had taken.  I should add that on rereading the evidence I gave then, I would not see any reason to significantly change any of it.  I resigned\/retired from the NTMA about six months later and just over one year before my contract expired. <\/p><p> As a general comment before turning to the specific lines of inquiry that the committee has addressed to me, I should make the point the NTMA was quite a small organisation at that time, with a total staff of 169 when I left at end-2009.  It had four main businesses, namely the borrowing and debt management functions of the State - its original purpose; the management of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; the State Claims Agency; and the National Development Finance Agency, as well as a significant number of other functions, including a small NAMA unit.  These had all been assigned to the NTMA in accordance with a large number of pieces of primary legislation.  A NAMA unit was set up in advance of legislation.  I should emphasise that the NTMA had no regulatory, policing or oversight role and, except to the extent I might be asked for specific views, no policy input role.  It was recognised by the Nyberg report that the NTMA was not a public authority.  Nevertheless, it did provide any and all assistance it was asked for during the banking crisis, but would not have been party to, or present at, many of the discussions between Government Ministers, the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. <\/p><p> I propose to respond to each of the 24 lines of inquiry in the order that you set out.  I should state that, in several instances, I am unable to provide any assistance as I have no information on the subjects.  In the case of others, where I have no specific knowledge, I have given such information or views as I have or may have expressed elsewhere. <\/p><p> The effectiveness of ECOFIN and DSG - the adequacy of the DSG process, including consideration of the bank resolution legislation.  I had no involvement with ECOFIN from the time the NTMA was established.  The NTMA had been invited to attend DSG meetings from late 2007 onwards in relation to the placing of deposits with domestic commercial banks.  As stated in the Nyberg report, the NTMA reacted to the onset of the credit crisis like most market participants by withdrawing much of their deposits from private institutions and placing them with central banks.  The NTMA provided advice and assistance from 2007 in the following areas: assistance in accessing specialist expertise; preparation of contract documentation; gathering market intelligence; assisting with communications with rating agencies and providing information concerning cost implications of changes in sovereign debt rating; the provision of liquidity to Irish banks on the basis of ministerial direction.  It also put in place arrangements to allow it to engage in collateralised lending to Irish banks.  The NTMA provided comments on draft legislation, as requested, from time to time. <\/p><p> The next item - effectiveness of the CBI liquidity group under the joint financial stability committee.  The NTMA was asked to attend a group to discuss liquidity.  This was composed of a member or members of the Government, the Central Bank, Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, the Financial Regulator and the Attorney General - not all present on every occasion.  There was generally a discussion on the liquidity situation of the banks, the extent of their borrowing from the Central Bank and problems associated with emergency lending.  Frequently, all the attendees other than the NTMA, Central Bank staff and regulator's staff would adjourn to another room to discuss the situation.  The role of the NTMA was generally to specify what funds we had.  There was, from time to time, discussions on the NTMA placing funds with the Irish banks.  We would do so but, on legal advice, only on the basis of a written direction from the Minister for Finance.  I attended many of these meetings myself, and invariably did so when the Minister for Finance wished me to be present.  Generally, however, someone from the NTMA was present in Government Buildings when meetings were in progress, but, in many instances, would not have been in attendance at some or most of those meetings.  This was also my experience. <\/p><p> The role of advisers in analysing the crisis -  at the request of the Minister for Finance, we hired Merrill Lynch to provide advice to him.  The apparent reason for the involvement of the NTMA in this was that the Department of Finance wanted us to charge the cost to the NTMA operating budget, as they did not have adequate funds in their own budget to meet the cost - ultimately about &euro;6 million.  We also hired Dr. Peter Bacon, at the Minister&rsquo;s request, to produce a report for him which, ultimately, became the basis for NAMA.  In addition, PwC and Arthur Cox were engaged to provide financial and legal due diligence services, respectively, in regard to the Minister&rsquo;s directed investments by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission into AIB and Bank of Ireland in 2009. <\/p><p> The liquidity versus solvency debate - there is some validity in the argument that lack of liquidity can lead to insolvency.  Many businesses that are solvent on an ongoing basis will rapidly become insolvent if they run out of cash and have to realise assets suddenly in what might be called a fire sale.  However, in the case of the banks, the enormous amounts they had lent to individual developers to enable them to pay extraordinarily high prices for property, and the rolling up of interest, much of which may have been taken into the profit and loss account, meant that insolvency was almost inevitable.<\/p><p>Department of Finance actions - appraisal of the conditions relating to increasing the deposit guarantee scheme; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  I was in the United States on the night that the decision was taken and only became aware of it through a text message from a colleague the following morning.  If there was a risk of a run on the banks, then a guarantee on deposits was probably the best course of action.  I understand that the senior bonds were issued on the basis that they ranked <i>pari passu<\/i>with deposits.  The rationale for guaranteeing other bonds is not clear.<br\/><br\/>Effectiveness of reviews of banks&rsquo; loans books and capital adequacy.  I saw the PwC review of the banks&rsquo; loan books.  At that stage the damage had been done and the only question was the scale of the disaster.  The early review underestimated the size of the ultimate losses; much larger State support was later required.<br\/><br\/>Decision to nationalise Anglo in 2009 and alternatives.  At that stage it was probably inevitable.  By then there was nothing to indicate that it had a future as a privately-owned institution.<br\/><br\/>Establishment, operation and effectiveness of NAMA.  The decision to establish NAMA was taken very quickly by the Minister for Finance and I supported the Minister when he announced it.  I also, at his request, went to see Mr. Trichet at the ECB to tell him that we would need about &euro;60 million ... sorry, &euro;60 billion from the ECB to fund it.  I was hesitant about the amount of money that was going to be paid into the banks and the rapidity with which it was to be done.  The Minister felt it would free up the banks to start lending again.  I felt that we should take just some loans from the banks and see if that would encourage them to lend.  I also felt that the banks should be pressed to recover the loans themselves as they knew where the bodies were buried.  Transferring them to NAMA would be a bonanza for lawyers and other professionals, as well as requiring a large staff in NAMA.  In the event, a very large number of loans were transferred to NAMA at a substantial discount.  And regardless of what happened, the likelihood is that the outcome would have been the same.<br\/><br\/>Decision to recapitalise Anglo, AIB, etc., and alternatives.  Some type of banking system had to be preserved for the State and the Minister went for the two pillar bank model.  EBS was taken over by AIB.  The problem was that NAMA imposed very substantial discounts on the loans they took over - and I'm not in a position to give a view on the correctness of their discounts - and this had the effect of wiping out the capital of the banks.  They, therefore, had to be recapitalised to stay in business.<br\/><br\/>The cost of the crisis and sharing of the impact.  I have no particular insights on this.<br\/><br\/>Role and influence of the ECB.  The ECB and the Irish Central Bank - as part of the ECB - had a role as lender of last resort.  They did provide very considerable resources to the Irish banking system, with a reported 25% of their total lending being extended to the Irish banking system.  My only involvement with the ECB was, as mentioned earlier, to ask Mr. Trichet for funding for NAMA.<br\/><br\/>Options for burden sharing during 2008-2013.  In terms of sharing the burden with other eurozone countries, this just did not find acceptance.  In terms of what happened within the State, this was a matter for Government decision.  On the more general question, repayments abroad by the State in respect of its own debts were made as were repayments in respect of senior bank bonds, which, as I understand it, legally ranked <i>pari passu<\/i>with bank deposits.  Other repayments on junior bonds were also made.  However, many of the other payments were between Irish residents themselves and, as such, were a transfer of wealth within the Irish State.  In terms of the impact that they had on the balance sheets of banks and on their incurred losses, these had the same impact as if the cash involved was transferred out of the country.  There is, in my view, a valid argument that, to the extent that losses were incurred by Irish banks arising out of transfers between Irish citizens - and which gave rise in part to the need to recapitalise the Irish banks - the case for transfers from other countries, by way of free money or grants, to recapitalise the Irish banks was questionable.  Also to the extent to which cheap funds - i.e., at interest rates below what otherwise would have been the case - were made available to Ireland, there was a transfer of wealth from other eurozone countries to Ireland.  This applied particularly to funds provided by the ECB and this could be classified as burden-sharing.<br\/><br\/>The role of the eurozone and international partners in the decision.  I was not involved in this area.<br\/><br\/>The ... B1(a), the adequacy of board ... the composition, skills and experience of the board and board sub-committees; adequacy of board oversight over internal controls to ensure risk is properly identified, managed and monitored.  As CEO of the NTMA, I had no involvement with the above.  However, I would have read their annual reports and was very impressed at what they said they were doing in the area of corporate governance and risk management.  Boards can, however, be quite reliant on management to bring to their attention such items as are of importance.  There can be a tendency to swamp directors with vast amounts of paper and without prioritising issues with which a board should concern itself.  This may be seen as a form of self-protection by management, which can argue at a later date that all matters were brought to directors&rsquo; attention.  I do not know to what extent this was happening in Irish banks prior to the crash or the rationale they had for the very rapid expansion of credit.  Another important factor is the consensus culture on boards, where a discordant note may not be welcome, particularly on the part of a dominant chairman.<br\/><br\/>Appropriateness of funding sources - the mix, maturity profile and cost.  As CEO of the NTMA, this would not have been an area where I would have had an involvement.  I would have presumed that the highest standards would have applied.  However, I was somewhat perplexed at the very rapid growth in credit and on one occasion spent some time going through the Central Bank statistics to try to understand it.<\/p><p>The closest I could get to finding out the backing for this credit expansion was that, in respect of their Irish businesses, the Irish banks had borrowed somewhere between &euro;100 billion and &euro;200 billion.  As I was surprised at this, I asked a colleague to check my figures to see if it was correct.  He confirmed my findings, but was able to provide a more accurate figure.<\/p><p> On the same general question of some banks' approach to funding costs, I should add that on a reasonably regular basis, I came across non-Irish banks that lent money to us, and as far as I could see, either made no money, lost money, or took risks on their funding that I would have regarded as, at best, questionable on their part.  To some extent, at least, banks internationally were buying market share or keeping themselves high in international rating lists, even where deals made little or no financial sense.  I would not have thought this applied to Irish banks.<\/p><p> R1 (c) - appropriateness of the macroeconomic and prudential policy.  As CEO of the NTMA, I had no functional role in these areas and would have been very .. would have very little knowledge of prudential policy.  However, I was surprised that public expenditure was not cut back after the 2007 election, as it had been after the 2002 election, if for no other reason than to increase it again before the next election.  I also felt that the level of house and apartment building was unsustainable by any measure and, if applied proportionately to other countries, would have given figures that were multiples of what they were actually doing.  I think the same view was held by some persons at Government level and the hope was that at least some of the building workers could be employed in other non-housing construction areas.  I was also aware that costs and prices in Ireland were rising more rapidly than elsewhere in euro land.  These issues are difficult to correct, particularly in the absence of a crisis, and where so many people are benefitting.<\/p><p> The fundamental problem arose because Ireland moved from a regime which had relatively high annual growth in wages and prices but which also had its own currency and control over its value.  While movements in that currency were constrained by Ireland's membership of the European Monetary System, it was possible to have currency devaluations with the agreement of other member states.  What this meant was that when a country got into currency-related difficulties, it could, in effect, press the reset button by devaluing the currency and starting again.  This flexibility went when Ireland joined the euro, but, in return, it was relieved of the risk of speculative pressures on its exchange rate and enjoyed a much lower interest rate regime.  It also gained access to what appeared to be virtually limitless sources of credit.  However, because the pattern of relatively high wage and price increases continued, competitiveness was gradually lost.  Also, the Irish banks, instead of covering their lending from a large population of small to medium deposits, i.e. not large corporate deposits, relied to a great degree on borrowings from the international interbank market.  By their nature these funds are short-term and need to be constantly rolled over.  When this becomes difficult, and other sources of funding are not available, a crisis arises, which is what happened.<\/p><p> Effectiveness of the supervisory practice, Central Bank, Financial Regulator and Department of Finance: The NTMA had no involvement in the supervisory practice.<\/p><p> Appropriateness of the expert advice sought: as mentioned earlier, on the instructions of the Minister for Finance the NTMA got advice for him from Merrill Lynch and from Dr. Peter Bacon.  It may be the Minister was receiving advice from other sources also.  His decision to create NAMA would have been based on advice he obtained from Dr. Bacon.  Advice was also got from PwC and Arthur Cox.<\/p><p> Analysis of contrarian views: by the time the crisis occurred, I do not recall any strongly voiced contrarian views which were ... would have had a significant bearing on its outcome.  There were always calls from the Central Bank and other international organisations for more prudence on the part of governments.  This constant crying of wolf would have blunted its effectiveness.<\/p><p> Appropriateness of advice from the Department of Finance to the Government: apart from seeing a draft of a memorandum for the Government recommending the establishment of NAMA, I would not have been aware of what advice they were giving to the Government.<\/p><p> Appropriateness of the relationship between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: the NTMA would not have had any particular insights into these relationships and I would not be in a position to offer any view on them.<\/p><p> Adequacy and impact of international organisations' oversight on banking regulation: the NTMA would have had no knowledge of what was going on in this area.<\/p><p> There may be a perception in some circles that the NTMA was some, sort of, shadow Department of Finance or Central Bank.  While this was most certainly not the case, the NTMA did provide all such assistance and advice as we could during the financial crisis, based on the experience and knowledge we had and we assisted in procuring such other advice as was requested of us.  The Central Bank-Financial Regulator had a very large staff to deal with the banking sector.  The NTMA's role was very clear.  Its primary function was to raise funds for the Exchequer, not to provide liquidity for the banks.  This was the role of the Central Bank, as lender of last resort.<\/p><p> To put the role of the NTMA in context during the financial crisis and to show that we were actually doing in ... doing in line with our legal obligations, it may be worthwhile to set out some of the challenges faced and activities undertaken in 2009, and the situation at the end of that year.  We had a very full workload.  The national debt had gone up by &euro;25 billion during the year to stand at &euro;75 billion.  Even with that, however, the general government debt-GDP ratio was 65.6%, well below the EU average of 78.7%.<\/p><p>On a net basis, after deducting off cash balances and the assets of the National Pensions Reserves Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s debt-GDP ratio was 37.9% at end 2009.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009, of which &euro;24.6 billion was used to fund the Exchequer deficit, &euro;5 billion to refinance a maturing &euro;5 billion bond, leaving &euro;5 billion in long-term funding for the 2010 deficit.  Foreign investors held 84% of Ireland&rsquo;s bonds at end 2009.  The four major credit rating agencies still rated Ireland at AA at end 2009.  The yield premium over Germany had narrowed to 1.45%, down from 3 % earlier in the year.  The debt service costs were &euro;686 million below budget, approximately half of which was due to interest rates achieved by the NTMA on 2009 borrowing, which were lower than those prevailing at the time the supplementary budget, which was agreed in April 2009.<\/p><p> The State Claims Agency - the name used by the NTMA when dealing with claims - had received 1,219 new claims during 2009, had settled 1,631 claims and was managing about 4,000 claims at year end.  Of these, there were 1,783 clinical claims under management, with an estimated cost of &euro;693 million.  Obstetric-related claims, although only 18% of the total, represented 57% of the total estimated liability.  The State Claims Agency had a statutory brief to provide advice and assistance to all health enterprises and worked to support patient safety and help minimise clinical claims.  A comprehensive programme of training and services was undertaken in 2009, particularly targeted at hospital consultants and other speciality groups.  The State Claims Agency also dealt with employer liability, public liability and third-party property damage claims, with 2,271 such claims - having an estimated cost of &euro;90 million - under management at end 2009.  In this area, the SCA encouraged State authorities to implement internationally benchmarked health and safety management systems and worked with the Defence Forces, the Irish Prison Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other Government Departments.<\/p><p> The NTMA, as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, invested &euro;7 billion in preference shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland on the direction of the Minister for Finance, known as directed investments.  Arrangements were also made to transfer the assets of 16 universities and non-commercial State bodies&rsquo; pension funds to the NPRF.  The fund disinvested from seven companies and excluded four others because of their involvement in the manufacture of cluster munitions or other anti-personnel devices or because they had not sufficiently distanced themselves from their manufacture.<\/p><p> The NPRF was invested in quoted equities, including global large cap, global small cap and global emerging markets, fixed income, including eurozone government bonds and corporate bonds, and alternative assets, including private equity, property, commodities and forestry, absolute return investments and infrastructure, as well as the directed investments in the two main banks.  The directed portfolio, i.e., excluding the investment in the banks, recorded a return of 20.6% in 2009.  The fund at end 2009 was valued at &euro;22.3 billion.<\/p><p> The National Development Finance Agency, established in 2003 to provide a financial advisory service to State bodies in respect of capital projects, had its remit significantly expanded in 2007 to include the actual procurement of all PP public capital projects, except transport projects.  By end 2009, the NDFA had completed its advice on 48 projects with a combined capital value of over &euro;6.5 billion, was working on over 50 active projects and had brought the first bundle of schools to financial close.  Among the projects on which the NDFA had provided advice, and which were commissioned in 2009 or shortly thereafter, were the Criminal Courts of Justice building, the Dublin Convention Centre, the Aviva Stadium, the national integrated medical imaging system and much work had been put into metro north project, as well as the third level education PPP programme, the National Concert Hall, the DART underground project and the national plan for radiation oncology.<\/p><p> In addition to the above functions, the NTMA was responsible for: the Housing Finance Agency commercial paper programme; the provision of central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies - local government authorities, the HSE and vocational educational committees - providing them with a competitive alternative to the banking sector for their treasury business; the European Central Bank liquidity management, which was regulating the level of Government cash balances at the Central Bank of Ireland; agricultural commodity intervention bills issued on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture to fund the gap between agricultural intervention payments by the Minister and recoupment from the EU &ndash; there was a turnover &euro;465 billion, sorry, that's million, I think,  in 2009; dormant accounts fund - certain unclaimed balances on bank accounts and insurance policies are received and managed by the NTMA, &euro;135 million at end 2009, pending disbursement by the Government or repayment to the owners; the social insurance fund - the NTMA had managed the surplus on this fund since 2001 and during 2009 transferred &euro;2.9 billion back to the Department of Social and Family Affairs; emissions trading - the NTMA was designated as the national purchasing agent for the purchase of carbon credits on behalf of Ireland in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.<\/p><p> In summary, at end 2009 the NTMA had &euro;21.8 billion in liquid assets to fund the Exchequer into the future and &euro;22.3 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and its total staff at end 2009 was 169.  By the time the NTMA was brought into the deliberations on the banking crisis, there were no easy solutions.  However, by virtue of the fact that the NTMA existed and had prudently managed its operations, the State was in a much better condition financially to tackle the crisis than would otherwise have been the case.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#PPP00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1424,"content":"<p>Thank you very much and if I can invite Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p><p>Deputy, you have 25 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#TTT00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Chair, and you are very welcome, Dr. Somers, and thank you for getting through a very comprehensive statement there quite quickly.

When you're not there, you're not very sure.  I mean, I've heard so many different descriptions of what went on that night.  The one that seemed to me to be most credible was that the two main banks went in and said they were prepared to provide &euro;5 billion each to Anglo to keep them going on the basis that they would get a State guarantee and for whatever reason by, I think that was 6 o'clock or something in the evening, in the early hours of the morning that seemed to have turned into a guarantee of everything that moved.  Now, what happened in between, I don't know.  I mean, I wasn't there.  I've heard bits and pieces of gossip but if I was there and we were threatened with a run on the bank, I would have felt that whatever else happens, we cannot have a run of depositors on the bank and if that requires a guarantee, well, we give a guarantee.<\/p><p>The question then is what exactly do you guarantee?  Do you guarantee everything?  I would have guaranteed deposits.  Whether I would have guaranteed the full 100% of deposits or not, I don't know.  Because, you know, there would have been an interplay of ideas.  I certainly would have balked, I think, at going any further than that because I wouldn't have felt it was absolutely necessary to go any further than that.  The thing, as I would have seen it, was to avoid a run on the banks, a physical run on the banks with people panicking outside banks looking for their cash back and I would have felt that would have to be stopped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#VVV02400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1465,"content":"<p>So you wouldn't necessarily have guaranteed existing bonds, senior bonds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#WWW00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436396400,"counter":1466,"content":"<p>I would have needed a lot of persuasion.

The story was that if we didn't do this, the banks wouldn't start lending again.  Now, of course, you could say, with the benefit of hindsight, well, did we really want them to start lending again?  It was the lending that had caused all the trouble, and did we want to facilitate them in this?  But anyway, that was, kind of, beside the point  But, I felt that ... the banks were supposed to have 5,000 people dealing with all these problem loans, and we, at that stage, didn't have anybody.  I mean, we needed to build up a NAMA operation.  Now, I was very conscious myself of how difficult it is to get suitable people, to weld them into a team, to get them properly motivated, to set up all the systems, etc., and my initial idea - and I didn't know how the NAMA thing was going to develop at this stage - my initial idea was that if it came through the NTMA to run, maybe we could do it in the same way as we did with some of the other things we had.  You know, we had the NDFA, we had State Claims Agency, etc., and that maybe we could get a small number of people, perhaps 30 or 40 people, and get the banks to do the donkey work and we would oversee them, and pressurise them to, effectively, get the money back, because that was my first thought, you know, they, they probably have commitments to, to people, property developers.  And, I, I was shocked when I saw the level of loans that were out.  But, that they could pressurise people to get the money back.  I mean, they're well capable of pressurising people who owe them money to come back with it, whereas trying to set up a new NAMA unit. it didn't seem to me to be the optical solution.  Now, I accept I could have been wrong on that because I think, well, okay, if they have it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#YYY00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>Finally, Dr. Somers, can you explain why the Minister for Finance which would have been Brian Lenihan requested you to visit Jean-Claude Trichet, given that the Minister would have had regular contact with Mr. Trichet and his officials?

The way NAMA was developing, it looked as though they were going to need &euro;60 billion funding to buy the loans off the banks.  I knew Mr. Trichet for very many years because I had been on various committees with him and I knew him from the 1980s.  We had been on the EU monetary committee and we were involved with setting up the EBRD, etc., and I knew him reasonably well on a personal basis.<br\/><br\/>The Minister approached me about it, he said, &quot;Would you go and talk to Mr. Trichet and tell him we need &euro;60 billion?&quot;  So I said to him, &quot;Would it not be more appropriate for the Central Bank or the Department of Finance to do it?&quot;  And he said &quot;Would you go and do it you know him?&quot;  So I said &quot;Okay I'll go and do it.&quot;  So I arranged it anyway, I got my PA to ring Mr. Trichet's office and said &quot;Look I'd like to go out and see him.&quot;  I don't think we said what exactly I wanted and he said &quot;Yes that's fine.&quot;  And I arranged to go out and see him I think it was about March 2009.  I have the date here somewhere.<br\/><br\/>But that information got out to the Central Bank who were I think quite perturbed about it.  They and the Department of Finance insisted on accompanying me out to see Mr. Trichet.  The thing became a bit bizarre after that.  I think there were two from the Central Bank - the Governor and the head of the director general and I think it was Kevin Cardiff from the Department of Finance.  They went out themselves and I went out on a separate plane.  For the life of me I can't remember why.  We went into the ECB building and it became a bit fuzzy but they arranged that we would meet some officials from the ECB and what surprised me was the length of time that the Central Bank people took in trying to explain our situation to the ECB people.  I thought that they would be in regular contact and they would be way up to speed.  Then at some stage or other I said, &quot;What about meeting Mr. Trichet?&quot;  And I was told Mr. Trichet is not available.  So I thought that was very strange.  So I phoned back to my PA in Dublin and I said &quot;Would you ever ring Jean-Claude's office and find out what's going on here, I am supposed to see him?&quot;  So she contacted them anyway and she came back and she said &quot;Oh yeah no, he is available to see you at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock&quot;, - whatever the time was.<br\/><br\/>Anyway, it was coming up to that time and I said &quot;Where does the president sit?&quot;  So the Governor of the Central Bank insisted on coming with me and we went in to see Jean-Claude Trichet.  As I say I knew him well, I was on first name terms with him.  I was quite surprised that the Governor was not on first-name terms with <i>Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident<\/i>etc., and I would have thought they would have had a closer relationship.  So we chatted anyway and I said &quot;Listen Jean-Claude I am here on a rather difficult mission.  You are aware of our difficulties and I am afraid we are going to have to come to you looking for &euro;60 billion.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#ZZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>Just as well you knew him as Jean-Claude.

The hope was, I suppose, that confidence would return to the markets and that the interbank market might start functioning again.  But the difficulty was that we weren't the only country that was doing this.  I mean the general attitude of people who had money, surplus cash, instead of putting into the interbank market was to take it out and put it into local, central banks.  And then that of course, resulted in a huge squeeze on liquidity and money just wasn't available anymore.  Now, was that our problem?  My attitude was that's not our problem.  You know, we all look after what we're obliged to look after and the central banks can recycle the money and ... now, central banks were not very good at recycling the money, but there was no particular reason why they couldn't do it.

Because, as I say, I felt that they knew where the bodies were all buried - we didn't.  And we needed to put together a team to do this work and we didn't have a readily available team to do it, whereas the banks did have this team.  And I felt that they'd created the problem.  They knew what the problem was, they knew where the ... as I say, where the bodies were buried.  They knew the individuals they were dealing with and I felt that they should sort it out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the discount, I mean, there's no absolute value for anything.  The price of anything ... the value of something is what somebody's prepared to pay you and if there's no money around, of course, the value of a product, whether its a house or a piece of land or whatever, is going to fall.  So, in terms of the NAMA discount, I suppose I would have thought to myself, well ... I knew Brendan but I don't know if I said to anybody, \"He's going to cover his back - he's going to impose whatever discount he feels is necessary to make sure that he, at the end of the day, doesn't end up showing a loss.\"  And if I was in his position, I would have done the same thing.  Now, whether they had the correct discounts or not, I don't know.  I mean, I ended up then on the other side of the field as the State director with AIB and I was looking at this ... these discounts and I said, \"God, these are enormous discounts.  Are these justified?\"  And, of course, they were saying, \"Well, they're not.\"  And I said, \"Well, why don't you challenge them then?\"  And they said, \"Well, we can't challenge them [I think] 'til the whole process is finished.\"  And I think they felt they were not going to win anyway.  But that was it.  And the problem was the discounts then, of course, impinged on the capital of the banks and we ended up then in a situation where, okay, NAMA was not going to make a loss but, on the other hand, the banks had to be recapitalised by the State, so we put it into one pocket and took it out of another pocket and handed it back to the banks to recapitalise them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#CCCC00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers"},{"type":"speech","time":1436396400,"counter":1566,"content":"<p>And can I ask you about the &euro;42 billion discount?

He has &euro;1.6 billion in CoCos, these convertible shares, which he's getting 10% on, that's &euro;160 million.  So that's 400 and something million per year that he can get in interest out of the bank.  Now, the bank is supposed to be worth &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion.  It's not my decision, by the way, but if it was ... if I sold the bank ... and you sell it in a tranche, say, you sell 25% of the thing, you're going to have to sell it at a discount because people are not going to pay you the full value for, you know, the shares where the State is still a 75% shareholder, so you're going to have to ... because they don't know what you're going to do.  So you're going to have to sell at a discount, so you're not going to get full value there.  Now, as you sell further tranches, I suppose you'd get a bit more value.  But even if you were to, say, to sell the whole lot today and you got, say, &euro;12 billion, the ... as I understand it, the only thing you can do with that money is use it to pay down the national debt, you can't actually use it to spend on, you know, worthwhile projects.  Now, if you use it to pay down the national debt, well, I think the ten-year rate on Irish Government bonds is about 1.7%.  So that's just over &euro;200 million that you'll save on interest payments on the national debt.  However, if you don't do that, you can collect 400 and something million per year in interest, which you can do what you like with.  You know, that comes in as general Government revenue as far as I know.  Do what you like with it.

Why ... what was our pay model?  When the NTMA was set up, it was set up because we could not hold staff.  By the way, I was secretary of the Department of Defence.  I was enjoying myself over there, you know, it was a boy scout's dream - best job I ever had.  The Government changed in 1987 and I was hauled back to the Department of Finance to, as Mr. Haughey said it, you know, he knew something about financial affairs, we've got to get this scene in order.  Now, you actually couldn't get staff into the place on the pay rates and you ... anybody who knew anything about the financial affairs then left, they went off to brokers, banks, whatever.  They left.  We were playing against the best in the world.  We were borrowing in every currency that you could imagine because we had Irish pounds, you couldn't borrow very much in Irish pounds, we were borrowing Kuwaiti dinar, dirhams, yen - everything.  It was quite a tricky business because you had to have some knowledge of the capital markets of the world and we did not have that expertise in the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>  So we were playing against the Goldman Sachses and the Merrill Lynches and everything else and the general view was we were losing.  That we were not getting the best deals.  And the Government of the day said, \"Okay, if you can't beat them join them.  We'll set up the NTMA.\"  And Albert Reynolds was very clear about this in the D&aacute;il, that, \"We'll pay whatever it takes to get the best because no matter what we pay people, it's still a fraction of what you can gain or lose by a good decision compared to a bad decision.\"  So I hired people in on the basis of a basic rate of pay and a performance-related bonus and a car and, I think, VHI.  Now the car, because of the BIK thing was a questionable thing.  And we hired people in and we, you know, we got the debt, I think, under control - at lease we got the interest bill under control.  And gradually, then ... I was approached by Dermot Gleeson then, who was the Attorney General, and he said to me that the whole question of people suing the State had got out of control.  We had the question of the Army, I think virtually the whole Army sued for deafness and it was not well handled.  And there were other cases coming up - I mean, there was asbestosis and all kinds of things coming up - and he came over to me and he said, \"Could you fellas set up some sort of an organisation that would pay people and not have the State ripped off?\", because he said he saw it on both sides; he saw it, you know, claiming on behalf of people and then, as Attorney General, trying to defend the cases.  So I said, \"Well, I know nothing about it\", and he said, \"Well, you're the only ones that have the commercial capability because you can hire people in and you can pay them\".<\/p><p>So anyway he, that Government lost office then and then it went onto David Byrne, who became the new Attorney General, I said to him \"do you want to proceed with this?\" and he was very enthusiastic.

But when, when I saw the amount of money that they had been lending to these other people and we were out, as I say, scavenging, looking for &euro;100 million here and &euro;100 million there to keep the ship of State afloat, I was flabbergasted by it.

See, we always maintained as much cash as we could because I saw what happened to the South American republics in the 1980s.  They were not in the high ... they were nothing like as indebted as we were.  But the problem they ran into was one of liquidity.  They left their ... they didn't pre-pay loans or anything.  So ... and when a year would come up, they'd have not only the borrowing requirement for that year to meet but they'd also have all the repayments of loans in that year.  Now, we saw what happened to them so our policy was ... sorry, I'm digressing slightly but just to try and answer the question for you.   Our ... we used to try and pre-pay loans one to two years before they matured so that, say in year ten, when that came up, we would have actually pre-paid that loan in year eight.  So when it came to year ten, all we seemed to have to do was to borrow for the borrowing requirement of that year and maybe not even that much because we would have pre-borrowed.  And then in that year, we'd say, \"Okay, all we need is the money for this year or some of the money for this year\", but we would also, without necessarily advertising the thing, borrow other money and we'd try and pre-pay other loans that were coming up in the next couple of years so that we didn't get hit for any huge amount of repayments in any particular year.  So the result was, we built up a pot of cash and that cost us money because we had to pay interest on it.

Given that you were there up to the end of 2009, did you see the inevitability at that stage of where all of this was going and what, do you believe, were the main factors that lead us into a programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070900002#OOOO02500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436396400,"counter":1813,"content":"<p>I didn't.  I never thought that it would happen.  I mean, one of the nightmares for us for many years - because I was responsible for our end for many years - was the IMF.  I mean, that was the thing.  Actually ... because we would be writing memos to Government telling them to cut back on their expenditure.  That was the bogeyman that we held up, \"Listen, if you don't behave yourselves and get your finances under control, the next thing is well have the IMF in here running the show for us.\"  So, for me, I felt it was the ultimate humiliation actually for us, as a country, to have the IMF come in to run the show for us.  Why did it happen?  You know, we had three years warning of this thing.  This all started in 2007 ... August 2007.  And the bailout thing eventually occurred in ... three years later in 2010.  And you'd say to yourself, \"Well, could we have got our act together better?  Could we have sold ourselves better or whatever in the meantime?\"  I mean, we had been ... my colleagues and I, we had been through worse crises in the 1980s where our debt was enormous and, you know, we go through it.  We tapped every bank in the world for a few bob and none of them knew that we'd tapped the other fellas.  So we'd a vast number of very small loans and suddenly we'd a big load of cash.  And that gave great confidence then.<\/p><p>So what happened, you know, between my leaving and the collapse ... I'm not saying, by the way, if I was around that it wouldn't have happened.

Well, I supported the whole NAMA project initially.  And, I mean, the Taoiseach said he went around the table and asked us all did we support it and I said \"Yes.\"  I, kind of, began to get cold feet then about it as time went on and I saw the implications of it and the idea that we'd hand vast amounts of money over to the banks.  And I tried to persuade the Minister, and I failed on this, say, \"Look, could we start with a few loans or something and see would that solve the problem.  Why do we have to take everything from them?  Or why can't we just, you know, get the banks to solve the thing and get them to pull in these loans that they've extended?  Why do we have to do this?  They created the problem and force them to do something about it.\"  He didn't seem to have an appetite for that.  I mean, he ... the whole Peter Bacon project ... he had met Peter Bacon somewhere or other, who had told him about this, kind of, project and he then rang me and said would I hire Peter Bacon, negotiate it with him, provide him with a room, etc., to produce a report to give him.  And Peter Bacon produced this thing very fast.  I thought actually, myself, that it would be turned down by the Department of Finance, because the one thing the Department of Finance were very good at was turning down things and I reckoned this would never get past them.  But it did and suddenly it became Government policy and it took legs.  And suddenly here we were with this thing and it was, kind of, semi-frightening that ... you know, that we were going to take on this huge liability and hand over all this money to the banks and I tried to see could I slow it down because, well, I never saw the likes of it before.  And it was done in Sweden.  You see, there was a Swedish model, but I think in Sweden it was only about 8% of their GNP.
