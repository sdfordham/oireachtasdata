A briefing note from the Department on the Supplementary Estimate has been circulated to members.  I hope everyone has studied the document and that we will find out if what is included in it has been achieved in the Department's outputs.  I presume that is agreed to. <\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I also welcome the officials from her Department, Mr. Brian &Oacute; Raghallaigh, Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh, Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, Mr. Conor Falvey and Mr. Trevor Donnelly, and thank them for their attendance.  As the Supplementary Estimate is required to facilitate the introduction of a new subhead provision for capital expenditure under the arts, culture and film programme and the transfer of a number of surpluses under subhead A.16, Cork Event Centre, to a number of other subheads.  I invite the Minister to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014111300002#A00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1415872800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>As a briefing note has been provided for the committee on the proposed Supplementary Estimate, I intend to make only a short opening statement so as to allow an opportunity to discuss issues members may wish to raise.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.  Its principal purpose is to facilitate the reallocation of savings under subhead A.16, Cork Event Centre, in my Department's Vote.  Cork City Council is leading the Cork Event Centre project, with funding coming from a number of sources, including my Department.  Following recent discussions between my Department and the council, it is evident that none of the money, &euro;10 million, originally allocated in my Department's Vote in 2014 will be required this year.  The timing and the amount of funding required in the future will be determined by the progress made by the council and its partners in bringing this important project to fruition.  My Department will continue to work closely with the council in order to provide its share of the funding, as required, having regard to the annual Estimates processes and the progress the council will make in the months ahead.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, we must deal with the position in 2014.  The first effect of the Supplementary Estimate will be to establish a new subhead, A.17 - Expo Milano 2015, under the arts, culture and film programme.  The second will be to enable the transfer of &euro;5.149 million in savings to the new subhead and two other subheads, A.8 - Culture Ireland, and B.5 - National Heritage, National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p><p>  The new Expo Milano subhead will receive &euro;2 million; the Culture Ireland subhead will receive &euro;650,000, while the balance of just under &euro;2.5 million will go to the natural heritage subhead.  As outlined in the briefing note provided for members, this funding will support essential preparations for Ireland's participation in Expo Milano 2015, relating to design approval, site preparation, prefabrication of the building and preliminary construction works.  It will provide for increased funding requirements under the Culture Ireland programme, including supports for the first ever official State visit to Britain by an Irish Head of State.  A particular focus in this regard was the very successful Ceili&uacute;radh event in the Royal Albert Hall.  The concert had an audience of 5,000, including invited guests from across the political, economic, social and cultural sectors, as well as those who have contributed to the Irish community in Britain.  It attracted more than 1 million television viewers in Ireland and more than 3.7 million viewers on the BBC.  The funding will support increased demands in the payment of compensation to turf cutters, including those on sites in natural heritage areas who became eligible for such compensation with effect from this year.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned, the Supplementary Estimate provides for the introduction of a new capital allocation, amounting to &euro;2 million in the current year, under subhead A.17 - Expo Milano 2015.  The Government has decided that, as part of the national approach to building strategic links with key EU partners, Ireland will participate in Expo 2015 in Milan.  Earlier this year my Department was appointed as the lead Department in this regard and this funding will allow for the necessary preparations to ensure Ireland's participation next year will be successful.<\/p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to the fact that the Supplementary Estimate will be neutral in its Exchequer effect.  I am happy to address any issue members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014111300002#A00400","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1415872800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>As one of those who was in the Royal Albert Hall for the Ceili&uacute;radh event, every cent spent on it was well spent.

I apologise for the fact that due to diary constraints we were not able to schedule a meeting prior to the October General Affairs Council, GAC.  However, I will provide the committee now with a brief update on discussions at that meeting and at the September General Affairs Council.<\/p><p>  I will start with the October GAC.  The focus of our attention last month was on preparations for the October European Council, which concentrated in particular on the climate and energy policy framework for 2030.  During the Council, Ministers worked to whittle down the number of issues which would remain for decision by the Heads of State and Government.<\/p> <p>As members will be aware, agreement on the framework was by no means a foregone conclusion, given the differing priorities and constraints of member states.  We can be very pleased that an agreement was achieved at the European Council, and that the compromise text represents a successful outcome both for the European Union and for Ireland.  As the Chairman will be aware, the Taoiseach briefed the D&aacute;il on the detail of the agreement, as well as on Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations, during his post-European Council statement on 5 November.  At the October General Affairs Council, Ministers also held a short thematic debate on follow-up to the Union&rsquo;s strategic agenda.  This focused on implementation of the fourth chapter on freedom, security and justice.  The UK<b><\/b>provided an update on efforts to secure agreement on its opting back in to certain EU policing and criminal justice measures, in tandem with a block opt-out on 1 December.  I will return to this issue in more detail when I brief the committee on the November General Affairs Council agenda.<br\/>In addition, the future composition of the Committee of the Regions, to take account of the accession of Croatia, was discussed but this was inconclusive.  Finally, Ministers agreed to mandate the Presidency to engage with the Commission and Parliament with a view to strengthening inter-institutional engagement on annual and multi-annual programming.  Again, I will return to this issue shortly.<br\/>At the September GAC, in addition to an initial consideration of the October European Council agenda, Ministers held their first thematic debate on the follow up to the Union&rsquo;s Strategic Agenda.  The focus of the debate was on a union of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  As we all know in this House and outside it, these are issues which are weighing heavily on the minds of European governments and our citizens, and which will feature prominently at the December European Council.  Conclusions were adopted on an EU strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian regions, and Ministers also received an update on the work of the friends of the Presidency group on improving the functioning of the EU.<br\/>I will now turn to the agenda for this month&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  I should clarify that my remarks will focus on the agenda for 18 November, which will be attended by Ministers with responsibility for European Affairs.  On 19 November, I will also deputise for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin at the General Affairs Council cohesion meeting. This is a special formation of the GAC to allow Ministers responsible for cohesion policy to meet in formal session.  However, as the committee will be aware, lead responsibility for cohesion policy continues to lie with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.<br\/>The regular General Affairs Council on 18 November will provide a first opportunity for the GAC to engage with the new First Vice President of the Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans.  Members will be aware of the new structure of the Commission.  Vice President Timmermans has been given a key role in terms of inter-institutional relations, better regulation, rule of law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It will be very interesting to hear his perspectives on the General Affairs agenda specifically, and on how he intends to conduct his very important role.  <br\/>Next week's GAC will begin preparations for the December European Council by reviewing the draft annotated agenda.  We received the first draft of the agenda earlier this week and, as expected, the focus will be very much on economic and social policy.  Discussions at the European Council will be informed by a number of key contributions expected over the coming weeks.  First, the Commission will be producing its annual growth survey, marking the beginning of European semester 2015.  The annual growth survey sets out the EU&rsquo;s broad economic priorities for the year ahead and provides an important frame of reference for national economic and budgetary decisions.<br\/>Second, the EIB-Commission task force which was recently established to identify impediments to investment and to strengthen the investment project pipeline across Europe will report in December.  This will be an important input to President Juncker&rsquo;s plans for an ambitious jobs, growth and investment package, which aims to mobilise &euro;300 billion in additional private and public investment in the real economy over the next three years and which he is expected to elaborate upon at the European Council.<br\/>Third, the Italian Presidency will be presenting a synthesis report in December on the political debates across the different Council configurations on the forthcoming mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy.  This will be produced for endorsement by the GAC in December in the first instance.  Also, as the Committee will be aware, the new Commission will adopt an opinion by the end of this month on the draft budgetary plans submitted by the member states in October.  Commission Vice President Katainen indicated on 29 October that, while not prejudging the final outcome, the Commission has not identified any cases of particularly serious non-compliance.  I would be pleased to discuss these issues in more detail at our next meeting when we will have more information.  Allow me to commend once again the tremendous work of this committee and its Chairman in contributing to the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation on the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the sessions with key stakeholders which were held recently.  The report launched here this morning represents an important milestone in terms of Oireachtas engagement on Europe 2020 and the European semester process in total.<br\/>In addition to economic issues, the European Council is scheduled to review the EU&rsquo;s response to the Ebola virus crisis, following the significant ramping up of financial assistance pledged last month.  Efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters to conflicts such as those in Iraq and Syria will also be considered, and other external relations issues may be addressed in light of developments as they arise.<br\/>The second issue to be discussed by the GAC is an initiative to promote and ensure respect for the rule of law in the EU.  This stems from a sense among member states that the EU could benefit from more open and honest discussions of the challenges within its own borders in upholding the fundamental values upon which the Union is based &ndash; the so-called &quot;Copenhagen criteria&quot;.  Given that the EU provides a benchmark, and indeed an anchor, for reforms in the area of rule of law in many third countries, it is important for our own credibility that the standards continue to be respected in EU member states.<br\/>The Committee may recall that this issue was reviewed at the GAC last March on the basis of a Commission communication on a new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law.  Following an initial exchange of views, including legal questions raised, Council agreed to revert to the issue.  The specific proposal to be considered by the GAC now is that the Council would play a central role in protecting the rule of law by promoting a transparent dialogue at political level amongst our member states.  Ireland is supportive of such dialogue.  I would recall that, during our Presidency, Ireland initiated a separate, though related, debate in the Justice and Home Affairs Council about protecting fundamental rights and enhancing the rule of law as a means of tackling the growth in hate crime, xenophobia and other forms of extreme intolerance across member states.  The EU cannot afford to be complacent about these important issues.<br\/>The GAC will continue its series of thematic debates on the five overarching priorities of the EU's strategic agenda adopted at the June European Council, by looking this month at the third priority, &quot;an energy union with a forward-looking climate policy&quot;.  Building an affordable, secure and sustainable energy union is in all our interests.However, to ensure our energy future is under full control, it is essential that all three pillars of EU energy policy &ndash; security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability &ndash; are considered in the context of an EU energy union.<\/p> <p>The completion of the internal energy market will be a key step towards energy union.  In this regard, Ireland welcomes indications that Commission Vice President &Scaron;ef&egrave;ovi&egrave; intends to place particular emphasis on security of supply and solidarity among member states.  The importance of integrating peripheral and poorly connected member states into the internal energy market is a key interest for us and was a theme which featured prominently during negotiations on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework.  I am hopeful that we can build on the momentum of the October European Council, both in progressing our energy union goals, but also in realising the EU ambition of becoming a competitive low carbon economy by 2050.<\/p><p> Strengthening inter-institutional annual and multi-annual programming is also an agenda item at the November GAC.  The European elections in May were the first step in a major institutional transition which has since seen the designation of a new European Commission and High Representative and the confirmation of a new President of the European Council.  This institutional renewal marked the opening of a new legislative cycle within the EU and provides an opportunity to refocus on what we want the EU to do and how we want it to function.  Following a tasking from last month's Council, the Presidency has been engaging with the Commission and Parliament with a view to strengthening inter-institutional engagement on annual and multi-annual programming.  The Presidency will report to the November GAC on these efforts.<\/p><p> As part of the engagement on annual programming, it is also planned that the GAC will have the opportunity to discuss and have an input into the Commission's draft annual work programme prior to its finalisation.  The work programme, which sets out the schedule of legislative proposals to be brought forward by the Commission next year, is informed by the political guidelines which President Juncker presented to the European Parliament in July.  A letter of intent from the Commission President, listing the broad priorities for the work programme, was received just this morning.  I think the joint committee also received a copy.  The Department of the Taoiseach is in the process of co-ordinating the views of Departments.  From an initial reading, I am satisfied that the priorities are broadly in line with the strategic agenda negotiated by the European Council.  Ireland is supportive of closer co-ordination between the EU institutions in framing an approach to legislative programming and we welcome the opportunity for the GAC to provide feedback to the Commission on its annual work programme before finalisation.  We consider it essential that the institutions work effectively together, not as an end in its own right, but to ensure that the Union is delivering as efficiently and effectively as possible in the areas of most importance to its citizens.<\/p><p> Protocol 36 to the treaties has been added as a possible item on the GAC agenda.  The joint committee will be aware that the UK is exercising its right under Protocol 36 to opt out of more than 130 EU police and judicial co-operation measures on 1 December.  The UK has indicated that it wishes to rejoin 35 of these measures, including the European arrest warrant, on the same day.  Negotiations on the UK rejoining these measures continued throughout 2014 and the issue also featured on the agenda of last month's GAC.  I am pleased to report that Spain has lifted the final reservation on this file which means that all member states are now likely to support the UK rejoining the 35 measures.  In addition, a vote on Monday in favour of a statutory instrument in the UK House of Commons was interpreted by the British Government as a vote in favour of rejoining the 35 measures.  This means another significant hurdle has been crossed.  A vote is required in the House of Lords and this is expected to take place next week.  It is expected that the UK will use the occasion of the GAC to read into the Council minutes the details of its agreement with Spain in relation to the 35 measures that the UK wishes to rejoin.<\/p><p> Ireland has been following developments in relation to Protocol 36 with close interest and we have been actively encouraging a speedy resolution of the issue.  We are very pleased that the way is now open for the UK to rejoin the most important 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.  It is vital for both countries that we have the closest co-operation possible in the fight against crime and that co-operation can continue in a seamless fashion after 1 December.<\/p><p> Under any other business, the Presidency will provide an oral update from the third meeting of the Friends of the Presidency group on improving the functioning of the EU.  This group, which operates at official level, has been considering a variety of questions relating to the functioning of the EU system with a view to recommending how, within the framework of the current treaties, EU action might be made more effective.  Topics discussed by the group include how inter-institutional co-operation could be strengthened in respect of annual and multi-annual programming, how to improve regulatory fitness and reinforce the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, how national parliaments might be supported in their EU engagement, and how the functioning of the Council and the General Affairs Council specifically might be improved.  The group is due to meet once more in early December, after which the Presidency will prepare a report for presentation to the December GAC.  Ireland has contributed actively to the three meetings of the Friends of the Presidency group held to date and I look forward to the presentation of the Presidency report in December.<\/p><p> As mentioned at the outset, I will also represent the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform at the segment of the GAC focused on cohesion policy.  While I will not go into detail, I can confirm that there are two main items on the agenda for cohesion Ministers.  The first will be an exchange of views on the Sixth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion, which analyses the socio-economic and governance challenges member states and the regions face and assesses the impact of cohesion policy and public investment on economic and social disparities.  The second item deals with the role of cohesion policy in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.  As the joint committee will be aware, cohesion funding has played an important role in Ireland's economic development.  The Government has identified its priorities for cohesion funding for the 2014 to 2020 period.  These include promoting growth and competitiveness; combating unemployment and social exclusion; promoting research, technology development and innovation and the competitiveness of the business sector; and promoting an environmentally friendly and resource efficient economy.  These are all priorities that are closely aligned with the Government's overall focus on jobs and growth.<\/p><p> I thank the joint committee for its attention.  I am happy to take any questions members have on the GAC agenda for 18 November 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300003#B01900","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415888100,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for what was, as usual, a very comprehensive contribution.  I will start off as I have a couple of quick questions.  The Minister of State took part in some of the joint committee's deliberations on the Europe 2020 strategy prior to his elevation to his current position.  We published this morning a report on foot of our review of the strategy which looks at things like the targets and the need to have a better approach as opposed to a one-size-fits all approach.  We consulted various stakeholders and had significant input from the Committee of the Regions which was concerned about regional disparities.  Many present believe that is a significant issue and I am aware that the Minister of State has spoken about the Munster area and Cork in particular.  He will be aware of the difficulties posed to ensuring balanced regional economic growth.  What are the Government's views on the Europe 2020 strategy's mid-term review?<\/p> <p> The second issue relates to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  It was not discussed today in the Minister of State's contribution, but he will be aware of the growing concerns many have.  This is especially the case in Germany, where concerns are growing about the progress of the trade talks.  Could he give the committee an update of where he thinks we are with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300005#D00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415888700,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I also thank the Minister of State for a comprehensive and thorough report.  I am especially heartened by the paragraph where he notes President Juncker's plans for an ambitious jobs growth and investment package for Europe, in which he identifies &euro;300 billion to be spent.  I hope this country will benefit from that and that it will help us bring our unemployment levels down to single digits in percentage terms.  I presume the Minister of State will be in there batting with other Cabinet colleagues to ensure we come out of that well.  His reaction on that would be welcome.<br\/>The Minister of State graciously complimented our report on the Europe 2020 strategy and he will know that a central aspect of our report was the need for a territorial dimension to the distribution of European funding and support funding and, indeed, in economic development in all spheres, including in the &euro;300 billion cited earlier.  While the Border, midlands and west region represented by me and Senator Kathryn Reilly is making progress, and its well-documented progress over the years indicates the importance of European input, it is still in a very unequal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the rest of the country by all criteria.  That has its roots in the conflict in Northern Ireland and a number of issues, including the difficulty of attracting inward investment.  That area suffers relative to other areas.  It has improved but it suffers.  We are concerned that there would be continued input into that area.<br\/>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, committed in his budget speech to ensuring that the benefits of Ireland's economic revival are shared throughout the country.  Ireland secured &euro;1.2 billion of Structural Funds, which included a special allocation of &euro;100 million for the Border, midlands and west region.  With Government input, that should cause a &euro;2 billion spend, but I would like the Minister of State to comment first on his commitment and what he sees himself as fit to achieve on the territorial dimension in terms of bringing up the weaker regions, giving them an input into how money is spent and implementing positive discrimination in their favour.  That &euro;100 million extra is very welcome and hopefully will be used well and have a multiplier effect, but the area needs further positive intervention.  In the context of President Juncker's overall plans, that area has a difficulty attracting inward investment because of infrastructural deficits as well as everything else.  While I would like to see all regions brought up, and we are well aware of difficulties in the south east as well, my priority is the area I represent, the Border, midlands and west region.  I would like to hear a firm commitment from the Minister of State to the territorial dimension.  As a corollary of that, I would like a firm commitment to areas like mine that are suffering relative to other areas in the country and a commitment to a local dimension in the spending of moneys there.  The extra &euro;100 million is welcome, but we will need more.<br\/>I am also interested in the Minister of State's comments on how to get the &euro;300 billion spend, in public and private money, by President Juncker's initiative into the economy to generate jobs and so on.  It is very welcome and something we have discussed on many levels.  Could the Minister of State comment on how he sees Ireland benefiting from that and how he perceives a regional spread there?<br\/>We have wonderful economic progress in the country, thank God, but we do not have a proper dispersal of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300006#E00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1415888700,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the committee.  I wish first to make an observation about Protocol 36 and the UK's ongoing concerns.  It is interesting to see that although it is opting out of these 130 police and judicial co-operation measures, it is willing to rejoin 35 other measures on the same day.  It gives another dimension to the debate on co-operation, in-out treaties and everything else.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State mentioned climate change policy.  He attended the meeting last month with the Taoiseach, so he knows that the previous Government agreed unsustainable targets in our climate change policy which would have been particularly damaging to Irish agriculture.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State were very strong on the need to reverse this target.  How has this been received and what plans do they have to roll this out?<\/p><p>  Also on a farming theme, there are concerns in certain sectors regarding the TTIP progression, as the Chairman has said.  This is particularly the case in the beef sector, which is very important to this country which is a very important exporter of beef.  What has been done to alleviate the concerns within that sector?  As the Minister of State knows, Irish beef is of the highest quality, fully traceable, hormone free, and antibiotic free, unlike beef from the United States which has a regime of the use of hormones.  There is concern about the talks in that respect.<\/p><p>  On the energy union, the Minister of State mentioned \"the importance of integrating peripheral and poorly connected member states into the internal energy market\".  As an island country, what particular concerns would we have?  We have an interconnector with Scotland.  Are there plans for one with France or is that the type of issue that would be discussed?  There are particular energy issues relating to Russian gas supplies, but in this part of the world, as an island on the periphery, what plans and concerns does the Minister of State have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300006#E00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1415888700,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I will be very brief and concentrate on one area of his contribution: the rule of law.  It is a great concern to a number of us on the committee that some members of the European Union have enacted laws that one could almost say were racist in content and that the action of these governments brought their national policy fundamentally into conflict with the EU.  I am delighted to hear the Minister of State's views on this and I support the position I presume he will take on the Copenhagen criteria, because we have compelled and continue to compel aspiring members, from Albania to Montenegro, to comply with our definition of the rule of law, yet we have seen events in countries such as Hungary and - although it is not quite a full member - an interesting series of referenda that have taken place in Switzerland which have limited the free movement of labour.  Those have sent warning signals to us.  We also have the extremely provocative policies advocated by UKIP in the UK.  While we will be looking at the rule of law as it applies within the family of the EU, and the Union is very conscious of the growth of hate crimes, xenophobia and other forms of extreme intolerance across member states, is the Minister of State satisfied that Ireland as a single nation within the family of the EU has taken enough steps to prevent the rise of xenophobia and racism?<\/p> <p>Does he share any of my concerns that there are obvious signs, for example, most recently in Waterford where Roma families were marched upon?  Is our hate crime legislation sufficiently strong at a national level to protect the country's image, which is important?  Everyone present would welcome our phenomenal transition from a single ethnic group of white Roman Catholics 30 years ago to a diverse, multicultural and racially complex society in which we have granted citizenship to 60,000 people from 120 nations.  Sometimes, we defer to Europe or point to things going wrong in, for example, Switzerland and Hungary, but will the Minister of State assure me he is confident that our beautifully diverse nation is adequately protected by legislation on hate crimes, xenophobia and religious intolerance?  Strong allegations have been made of growing religious intolerance between certain faith groups, not least of which relate to the fears expressed about adherents of the Muslim faith at the mosque in Galway.

If the Article 7 protocol is not invoked or there is a reluctance to do so, how can we prevent EU complacency?  It was stated that the proposal would be considered by the General Affairs Council and that a transparent dialogue would be promoted at a political level among member states, but will the proposal ensure that the rule of law is respected?

I will start with the issue of TTIP, which was the subject of the Chairman's second question and referenced by Senator Reilly.  I attended the informal TTIP negotiations in Rome on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, last month.  Also there was Mr. Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, and the outgoing Trade Commissioner, Mr. Karel De Gucht.  Senator Reilly mentioned the ISDS issue, which was discussed.  We need to get back to basics on TTIP.  The Chairman will be aware that the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada is progressing well.  The 28 member states must not focus overly on their national issues to the point where the trade deal falls apart.  We must remember that this deal has the potential for the EU as a whole to deliver annual GDP growth of approximately 2%.  This figure can be disputed and, by definition, is an unknown one, but such a level of growth in the global economy could be crucial in creating the jobs and so on to which we all aspire.<\/p><p>  I will reference some of our concerns.  As a small, open economy, we are supportive of concluding a robust trade deal.  Deputy Kyne identified a matter in respect of which we have concerns.  We are optimistic, however, that with regulation and a standardisation of the standards to apply to beef from the US and Europe, this issue can be addressed.  We are aware of the beef industry's concerns and the dairy sector's encouragement for us to achieve progress.  With the ending of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, there are significant opportunities for Ireland in this space.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about jobs, investment and President Jean-Claude Juncker's dialogue on the &euro;300 billion, which will be the subject matters of the December Council.  There is talk of a blending of private and public moneys.  In terms of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, there is a requirement that our customer markets, including the EU, achieve again some level of growth after an absence of a number of years.  We have achieved quite a number of months of growth with much difficulty, but progress elsewhere is necessary.  As the Deputy is aware, the joint European Commission-European Investment Bank task force is developing an investment project pipeline.  Within the context of that discussion, countries are being asked to feed in projects.  This has happened in Ireland and other member states.  In parallel, the process will establish clearly where the money will come from and on which projects money will be spent.  It will consider specific projects.  Deputy O'Reilly will be aware that we met with considerable success in the multi-annual funding process and secured money for the BMW region.  The purpose of cohesion funding is to ensure that those regions requiring support receive it.  Like us, the Deputy will be keeping an eye on the matter.  His question on the territorial dimension is to the forefront for the island as a whole as opposed to just the BMW region.<\/p><p>  Returning to TTIP, I meant to point out an important element that may be being overlooked.  The real benefit for Ireland of a robust trade deal is for our SMEs.  The same applies across the Union as a whole as well as in the US.  Multinational corporations have the ability to move to get around various laws, etc.<\/p> <p>However, smaller businesses require the removal of barriers to trade to allow them develop their business and, consequently, create employment.  We had this discussion previously where it was stated that if every small and medium enterprise took on another employee, the unemployment problem within the European Union would cease.  <\/p><p> The rule of law is a very important issue as Deputy Eric Byrne said.  To answer the second part of his question, the concern is that currently there is no adequate monitoring mechanism to ensure that member states continue to uphold the rule of law or a forum for an open and honest discussion of potential breaches.  To alleviate some of his fears, the political and institutional mechanisms foreseen by article 7 of the treaty provide that member states can be sanctioned and suspended from voting in Council in cases of serious and persistent breach of EU values.  This has never been used and is considered a last resort.  To respond to the first part of the Deputy's question, our position is that the protection of the rule of law on human rights is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  I think that goes to the core of what all parties here believe.  We consider it essential that all member states demonstrate respect in their domestic policies for the fundamental values upon which the European Union is based.  In Ireland, as elsewhere, there is a need to constantly review our legislation and European laws and rules in light of the changing fabric and circumstances not only across Europe, but in our own country.  We have had debates in our own Parliament recently on xenophobia and other issues.  It is incumbent on us to ensure in this and the Upper House that we are constantly vigilant to any form of racism or hate crimes that happen on this island while also engaging with our European partners in that regard for the Continent as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300007#F00900","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415889900,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned towards the concluding part of his contribution that the friends of the Presidency group will meet again in early December and said that to date there have been three meetings to which we have actively contributed on issues such as how national parliaments might be supported in their EU engagement.

I warmly welcome the initiative to focus on the enlargement policy of the European Union precisely at a time when the policy is under quite considerable criticism, mostly for the wrong reasons.  In past reports and in the European Parliament elections, a lot of criticism has been voiced against enlargement.  In a sense it became a victim of the very toxic debate on immigration levels in a number of EU member countries, not least in the United Kingdom.<br\/>The new President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, has stated that there will be no further enlargement of the EU during his mandate.  He is technically correct, because none of the countries currently negotiating accession - Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey - are anywhere near conclusion.  Nevertheless, his comment sent a very negative signal about the EU's continued commitment on enlargement.  The situation was redressed thanks to the initiative of Chancellor Merkel at the end of August in convening a summit meeting of all the western Balkan leaders.  The initiative also emphasised the EU's continued commitment, particularly towards the western Balkans - a commitment which was solemnly entered into in 2003 at the summit in Thessaloniki, conducted under the then Greek Presidency, that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union, subject to all the necessary reforms being carried out.<br\/>It was also important that Chancellor Merkel's initiative emphasised what a grave mistake it would be for the European Union to reduce its focus on the western Balkans.  There are a number of reasons for that.  First, it would serve the interest of precisely those people we are trying to ensure are involved and active in the reforms, which will improve the entire situation - for example, the people who benefit from the current <i>status quo.  <\/i>I refer to the oligarchs and the organised criminal groups that are still active in a number of western Balkan countries in human trafficking, etc., who have a vested interest in ensuring that there is no change in the process.  <br\/>Second, the EU is not the only player in the western Balkans at the moment.  Russia is increasingly active.  Its increasingly assertive foreign policy is making itself felt, as witnessed in the recent visit of President Putin to Serbia just a few weeks ago.  Of course the energy interests are very much involved there. <br\/>Third, it is vital that the EU maintain its focus on the Balkans, if only because major reform efforts are still required in those countries.  The level of corruption is still very high and there is a lot of political interference in the judiciary.  Political dialogue remains weak, which means that parliamentary institutions do not function as they should.  For example, a number of parties have boycotted parliament because they feel their rights are not being respected, etc.<br\/>Perhaps even more worrying is the increasing pressure on the media.  All the international watchdogs and organisations, including the OSCE's representative on freedom of the media, have highlighted their growing concern at the worsening situation for the media, as well as the harassment to which civil society organisations are being subjected and the impact this is having on minority rights, not least lesbian and gay rights, which have been affected in a number of these countries.<br\/>Another critical area is unemployment.  The statistics show that the levels of unemployment for Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina hover around 30%, of which over 50% is youth unemployment.  Therefore, a major effort is required in all these aspects. <br\/>The countries that have the greatest problems at the moment, as reflected in the progress reports presented by the European Commission last month, are Bosnia, Herzegovina and Macedonia.  In these countries there is a lack of political will to move the reform process forward, which has affected their overall performance in their efforts to at least start the accession process for the European Union.<br\/>It is difficult to see the main solutions.  Definitely, the European Union needs to be much more determined in its approach towards the enlargement strategy, and much more prescriptive.  It must clearly set out what is required in all areas, such as independence of judiciary and political dialogue.<br\/>Visa liberalisation was a very good prescriptive approach.  Benchmarks were set out and roadmaps were established, and the countries of the western Balkans fulfilled all of those requirements and thus enabled visa liberalisation to enter into force.  A much more prescriptive approach by the European Union is definitely needed.<br\/>We would also advocate a much stronger voice for the EU on issues of media and civil society.  We want it to make sure that civil society is, as a matter of course, involved in the formulation of policy and in the decision-making process.  We are talking about countries that are still in transition and have a lot of fragile institutions that are affected by many vested interests.  Institutions of government also need to show greater accountability.<br\/>Another important area is that of political parties and how to inculcate a culture of dialogue in countries where this is not a given.  There is a need for compromise.  National parliaments of the EU could help with this by promoting training programmes, particularly those focused on the youth or younger generation.<br\/>Another important area in which the EU needs to be more proactive is economic development.  I refer to reforms in terms of promoting economic governance, ensuring public procurement is free from political interference, and creating an environment more conducive to business development and foreign investment, thus reducing the temptation for people in many countries to go abroad in order to make a life, get a job, etc.  These are all important priorities on which the EU can and must help in the countries concerned.  <br\/>I would like to outline one other interesting and important development from the recent progress reports.<\/p> <p>There is a suggestion from the European Commission that dialogue on foreign policy should be enhanced with the countries of the western Balkans and, of course, with Turkey, not least because of developments in the broader region, such as Ukraine, the impact of the more assertive Russian foreign policy and the developments in the Middle East.  Certainly we would wholeheartedly support greater dialogue with these countries on foreign policy issues in order to try to promote alignment with the EU approach.  Serbia is a strong actor in the western Balkans.  It will have the chairmanship of OSCE next year and will therefore assume a critical role, not least in relation to Ukraine.<\/p><p> My concluding word is that the EU needs to work much harder in order to demonstrate that its soft power - the transformative power it has had with very successful enlargements in the past decade - bears dividends and that there are a lot of advantages to be gained for both the EU and the western Balkans through continued enlargement.  Both sides must work hard at this to ensure the best possible results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415891100,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;.  I confess that because of the political problems witnessed in the Chamber I have been distracted and have not managed to read the bulk of the documentation, which I should and normally do.  I apologise to Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;.<\/p><p>  Members of this committee have travelled to countries to examine what was happening in them.  I have a very fond relationship with Albania, so it sticks in my memory.  When we were in Albania and Macedonia earlier this year the politicians were working extremely hard to comply with all the criteria as laid down by the EU.  They were extremely anxious to move closer to Europe.  In fact, we were there when they received recognition from the EU that they had passed, and they were overjoyed.  There has been a change of government, which has resulted in a more progressive, stable and open form of government.  In his classification of countries, Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; states that Albania and Serbia are the better of the four.  I concur, having been in  Bosnia-Herzegovina many years ago.  The biggest disappointment to me as an individual citizen and as a politician is that progress has not been made there.  Would Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; concur with me that ample warnings were given about the European Union's response to what was evolving in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the three power blocs - the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats - dividing the authority among themselves?  People felt that the peacekeeping missions were there for a long time.  The theory was that, as Croatia had aspired to membership and ultimately become a member, Serbia and possibly Kosovo would follow suit.  Four years ago some speakers who appeared before the committee told us that things were stagnating and going backwards.  Does Mr Fou&eacute;r&eacute; see grounds for us in the EU to be critical of ourselves, particularly with regard to what has happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina?<\/p><p>  When we were in Macedonia we got the feeling that people there wanted to move forward.  Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; placed Macedonia alongside Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I do not know enough about Macedonia to know of its intent to move forward.  In the case of Albania, it was fascinating that, notwithstanding the issues with regard to the rule of law and the allegations about criminality, they did mount - and it was not for our eyes - a major raid on a core of criminal gangs who were operating in the farmland.  A very powerful message was sent out to criminals that the government was on board.  I hope that Serbia, which is to take up the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2015, will use the role to progress development in that area.<\/p><p>  May I conclude with a question on the role of President Putin of Russia?  I note Mr Fou&eacute;r&eacute;'s expertise on Macedonia, which is to hold an election at the end of this month.  To what does he apportion blame for the evolution of what is almost a new cold war with Russia?  In his opinion, is Europe's relationship with NATO moving at such a pace as to make President Putin more and more insecure, hence the obvious escalation that will blow any day now in eastern Ukraine, with a huge influx of military equipment and troops?  Is Europe responsible in any way for the heightening of tensions and the loss of Crimea to Russia?  I am sure Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; is familiar with these frozen conflicts because of the situation in Moldova and so on.  I am trying to get a balanced understanding of the role of Russia and whether it is being provoked.  Is it a case of its recognising its inferiority as a world power?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300010#J00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1415891100,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; to the committee.  I wish to refer to his policy paper of 31 October.  What is striking is the eloquence of the picture it paints of the issues at stake in the Balkans.  He describes all that is wrong with the Balkan region, with political interference in the judiciary, a lack of political dialogue within the political parties, which is affecting the proper functioning of parliament, deep polarisation of society, which is exacerbated by heightened interactive tensions, and a level of corruption that not only has not diminished but has in many instances become worse.<\/p><p>  Obviously we have seen a great deal of progress in the past number of decades in terms of the enlargement process, particularly with the accession of the ten countries.  Notwithstanding that, does Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; see a heightened divide between east and west within the European Union?  In his opinion, is that becoming more noticeable, particularly in view of the economic difficulties we have had in many countries in the past number of years?  Is that leading to more concerns within the west?  We have seen the issues that arose when the embargo on immigration from Bulgaria and Romania was lifted on 1 January this year.  It was suggested that there would be an influx or a flood of migrants coming to work in the UK, in particular.  I remember seeing reports that the media were at the airport waiting for the expected hordes to come off the planes, but they lucky to find one person who had arrived.  Are they feeding the frenzy or are they responding to the frenzy that already exists?  Deputy Byrne has spoken about UKIP and the concerns that it is feeding into.<\/p><p>  The referendum held before Ireland joined the EEC showed very high levels of support for accession.  That high level of support has gradually dropped, for a variety of reasons.  Is that level of support evident in those countries?  The deputy Prime Minister of Turkey appeared before this committee a year and a half ago to generate support for Turkey's accession.  When I asked him about the level of support in Turkey for accession to the EU he said it was high but dropping, mainly because of all the rejections.  People were of the view that if the EU did not want Turkey to join, they should not be pursuing it.  They were not as strong in their support for joining the European Union.  What is the level of support evident among people in the western Balkans?<\/p><p>  We have discussed the rule of law in Hungary and the issues facing the Prime Minister, Mr. Orb&aacute;n, particularly the row-back in the past number of weeks with regard to taxing Internet access.  Does he think that allowing and permitting this to continue is feeding into the problems in the accession countries?  Does he think this is causing the accession countries to ask themselves questions?<\/p> <p>Why should we change?  Why should we enact any policies when other countries are going ahead anyway?  That is the main issue of concern.<\/p><p> In many eastern countries, we see the problems the LGBT community has and the persecution that goes on, which is deeply concerning.  In the West, in general, we are progressing.  That is not case in those countries and I wonder, as Deputy Eric Byrne said, whether this feeding in from Russia is evident in eastern European countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300010#J00300","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415891700,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome to Mr. Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute;.  It has always been the Irish Government's policy to support enlargement and that is what we wish for in terms of spreading the peace, increasing markets and a range of other reasons in favour of enlargement.  Having said that, the report is disturbing to the extent that it cites a lack of progress in readiness in the Balkan states.  We cannot have accession without the necessary internal reform.  I support the initiatives set out for greater involvement, greater benchmarking and closer administrative monitoring.  Is Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; of the view that we need the carrot and stick approach?  We need benchmarking and controls.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, cites the LGBT issue.  If the treatment of people is wrong, if there are inhumane practices and barbaric medieval laws and practices, it is difficult to positively intervene.  Is there room for us to give practical support in terms of infrastructure or investment to try to bring these countries along?  It is difficult because it is a chicken and egg situation.  If we leave them as they are, nothing happens.  If we invest in them while their human rights record, the rule of law and the justice systems are not in order, we are supporting something that is anathema to our core values.  How does Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; reconcile that?  Is there a practical way around it?  Unless we can intervene to a greater extent in a practical way, we cannot bring people with us.  However, we cannot condone the practices identified by Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne.  <\/p><p>  I share the interest of Deputy Eric Byrne on Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;'s reflections on the Ukraine.  To what extent does he think Europe was the catalyst by being overambitious?  Is it that Putin is the reincarnation of an old-style tsar with insatiable militaristic and territorial ambitions?  Perhaps it would not have mattered how we behaved.  With regard to the Ukraine, what does Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; think of the chances of the current tripartite government given its eastern difficulty?  Can it succeed?  Other colleagues, who are not present at this meeting, went to the Ukraine to monitor the elections and came home with a level of optimism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300011#K00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1415891700,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;.

The report mentions Macedonia and the commission on discrimination and states that the sorry list continues.  Are there other notable examples in that regard?  Are those Governments ticking the box by passing legislation but holding back on its implementation through practicalities like allocating insufficient funding?  Are there other pressures the EU can bring to bear?<br\/>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne referred to the rule of law, which Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; referred to in respect of double standards in the EU and the attacks on media and civil society in Hungary.  When that happens internally, it weakens the leverage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the candidate countries.  We discussed the rule of law with the Minister of State earlier in terms of the upcoming General Affairs Council.  The proposal is that the Council will play a central role in protecting the rule of law by promoting transparent dialogue at political level among member states.  Will the proposals on a transparent dialogue send a more positive message that we are upholding the rule of law internally and that the attacks will not be tolerated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300011#K00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1415891700,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I was disappointed to hear comments from Mr. Juncker about enlargement, particularly given the experiences referred to earlier when the committee visited the Balkans.  We were delighted to see the progress made in Montenegro and Albania.  There are clear signs they will end up within the European Union in the not too distant future.  There has been a slowdown in support from member states for enlargement.  The only difficulty is that we seem to be blaming the slowdown solely on candidate countries.  We tend to say that country X is not yet ready or that country Y has not made the necessary improvements.  The reality is the EU has a case to answer on why we are slowing down the process.  Perhaps it is the economic situation or concerns, however unfounded, about migration.  It is only fair that we face up to it and recognise it.  From talking to politicians within the candidate countries, they would like to us to make a statement that this is not just about the country being ready.  It is also about Europe at the moment not being ready to go at the same pace as before.  That might go some way to ensure there is no slippage in support for European membership to which Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne referred.  We saw the slippage in support in countries such as Turkey, which sees the EU dragging its feet and blaming candidate countries.  It would help if we fessed up and said it is as much to do with where Europe is as the candidate countries.<\/p><p>  I take the point about civil society.  When the committee met various civil society groups, we found a lack of capacity and a need to improve it.  It is a relatively weak civil society in many of these countries and that can only be helped by mentoring and sharing experiences by NGOs and organisations within the EU.  That needs funding and the pre-accession integration funds are out there for this purpose.  I wonder if Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; shares my view that they do not go far enough.  From the previous larger accession in the mid-2000s, we have learned the importance of making sure countries are ready and making sure civil society is built up in advance of integration.  The way we do that is by putting in the money and making sure they are ready when the time comes.<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Eric Byrne, I am interested in Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;'s views on Ukraine.  I was over there a number of weeks ago during the elections, looking at how the elections were panning out.  My experience of the procedures was positive and transparent and I did not see anything to concern me but I would not be optimistic about where the country is at.<\/p> <p>I would be interested in hearing Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute;'s views on this.  My worry is that we are heading for another frozen conflict.  Like Deputy Eric Byrne, I think the European Union made a mistake 12 months ago.  I attended a presentation made by Mr. Pat Cox when I was in Vilnius during the Lithuanian Presidency last year.  At the time, Mr. Cox and the former President of Poland, Mr. Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, were rapporteurs for the European Parliament in relation to the Eastern Partnership between the EU and Ukraine.  As recently as October 2013, they were very positive about where this was going.  They said it was absolutely on course and was going to happen.  They spoke about whether Yulia Tymoshenko would be released from prison, but they completely missed what came down the line two weeks later, as did the rest of Europe.<\/p><p> I am not trying to blame anybody when I say Europe could have been a little more aware of the historical context and of the commitments that were given 15 or 20 years ago.  If we had been more thoughtful in advance, we might not be facing the chaotic situation that prevails today.  I know from being there that it is harrowing for the people who are living there at the moment.  It is a very tough time for them.  My sense is that there will be no military assistance from the EU, the US or any other outside agency.  I have to say I do not think sanctions will work.  Having visited Moscow and spoken to people there over the summer, I would be fairly sure that Mr. Putin's position is very safe.  He has the support of the average Russian on this issue.  There is no pressure from within Russia to change the current policy.  I have to say the pressure from outside Russia, including from the EU, is limited at most.  I think we are staring at potentially another frozen conflict.<\/p><p> I am aware that Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; has experience in Moldova and Transnistria.  I know he was there with the OSCE as a representative during our Presidency.  Could he comment on this issue?  I am sure he is familiar with the term Novorossiya, which refers to the region where Mr. Putin might like to extend his country's influence.  Does Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; share the concern that we are going to see another frozen conflict there?  What is his sense of the Russian position on this?  What does he think Mr. Putin's end-goal is for the Novorossiya region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300011#K00400","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415892300,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the other members of the committee for their questions.  I will start by responding to the most difficult question, which relates to President Putin and Russia.  There is no doubt that many people in the West were taken by surprise when President Putin, with the stroke of a pen, tore up the rulebook that had been agreed by the international community after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Next year, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, which was a remarkable achievement in the middle of the Cold War.  It is a sad reflection on the times we live in that it would simply not be possible to rewrite that agreement today due to the extent of the frostiness that has seeped into East-West relations.  Indeed, we are on the threshold of a new cold war.  There is no doubt about it.<\/p><p>  It is very easy to rewrite history in hindsight.  Many of us in the think-tank community, if I can put it that way, believe the EU underestimated the impact of its efforts to reach out to Ukraine, especially in 2004.  Perhaps there was a lack of appreciation of how this would be felt in Russia, which always saw and still sees Ukraine as being very much part of its sphere of influence, just as it does with Transnistria and Moldova.  We are faced with that situation.  Crimea is lost, unfortunately, even if it is important not to recognise that from a legal point of view.  I doubt very much if it will ever be possible to redress that situation.  We are facing a worsening crisis in eastern Ukraine, where the recent elections were not able to take place, or took place to a very limited extent, because of the security situation there.  There is no doubt that we are on the threshold of a new frozen conflict.  Transnistria, which is a region of 500,000 people on the border between Moldova and Ukraine, has seen a protracted frozen conflict since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1992.  A process of dialogue with Transnistria is under way.  Those negotiations are not working as they should because of the impact of the Ukrainian crisis.  I fear that eastern Ukraine will become another Transnistria.  This is extremely worrying because it would affect the future of Ukraine.<\/p><p>  I am working with the crisis management initiative that was set up by Martti Ahtisaari to promote dialogue with different personalities in Ukraine, including members of parliament and representatives of civil society.  In July, we brought people involved in the Northern Ireland peace process to talk to people in Ukraine about elements of that peace process in terms of dialogue that could be useful for the dialogue in Ukraine.  There is no ongoing dialogue at all at the moment.  Efforts have been made by the current Swiss chairmanship of the OECD to launch a process of dialogue.  It was hoped that this might get under way after the recent elections, but the security situation is such that it has not been possible.  Dialogue is the only way to find a solution that must involve constitutional issues regarding what sort of powers to delegate to the eastern province.  The big problem is knowing who we should talk with.  Who do the so-called elected leaders in eastern Ukraine represent?  All of that is very suspect.  Of course it is fuelled and supported by Russia.  At the moment, the prospects are not very positive.  I am afraid they will only get worse before they get better.<\/p><p>  The EU must maintain its support for Ukraine.  When I walked around the Maidan central square in Kiev in June, I was struck by the number of EU flags everywhere.  I asked myself whether the Union is capable of responding to the aspirations of those flying the EU flag.  Is the EU able and willing to respond to the aspirations of the majority of the people of Ukraine who want to come closer to the EU?  It is true that it took quite some time for the EU to get its act together and move forward with different programmes.  A lesson was learned on both sides in terms of relations with Russia, with which we need to develop some sort of dialogue, and in terms of strengthening support for Ukraine as it moves from the current conflict situation to a post-conflict situation.  There are no magic solutions, unfortunately.  A great deal of energy and effort will be required on the part of the EU to deal with this matter.  I have mentioned the impact that this issue has had on the western Balkans.<\/p> <p>As I indicated, President Putin's visit to Serbia a few weeks ago was a demonstration of force by Russia and a statement that the European Union is not the only transformative power, so to speak, in the western Balkans.  Russia, with its narrative on human rights issues, gets a hearing in a number of countries in the western Balkans which are much closer to authoritarian methods of government than to the western democratic systems to which we are used.  It is for this reason that the European Union needs to be much more engaged and assertive in its overall relations with the western Balkans. <br\/>I will respond to the other issues raised individually.  On Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is true that we have given ample warnings to Bosnia and Herzegovina that they need to maintain their commitments to reforms and the implementation of European Court of Human Rights decisions regarding minorities.  There is a feeling somehow, certainly on my part but it is shared by others, that the hands-off approach of the EU in the past two or three years was not the correct one and there should have been much greater direct involvement by the European Union.  If it was possible to reach a beginning of normalisation between Kosovo and Serbia, there is no reason this could not also be done in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The new High Representative, Ms Mogherini, has indicated that this matter will be discussed next week at the Foreign Affairs Council and that there will be an initiative on the issue.  This is important.<br\/>As members will be aware, the British Foreign Secretary and German Foreign Minister issued an open letter last week to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The letter was a gentle hint to the European Union that it must be much more proactive in the country.  It is not only a question of reform.  The constitutional issues that arise must also be considered because the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina is dysfunctional.  I suggested that one possible model for a constitutional debate would be the Irish Constitutional Convention which concluded its work recently.  I suggested that the composition of the convention could provide some lessons or useful hints for Bosnia-Herzegovina.<br\/>On the level of support for European Union membership in the western Balkans, there is no doubt that it remains very high.  This is reflective of the aspirations of the citizens in the region who view their only future and security as being within the European Union, rather than outside of it.  That will remain a constant, even if a number of issues are undermining the credibility of the European Union.  Developments in Hungary have without doubt affected the credibility of the European Union because they show double standards.  The EU speaks of respect for civil society and the media in the candidate countries.  Why is it allowing the developments taking place in Hungary?  A second aspect is that some member states are hijacking the enlargement agenda to suit their own interests.  I refer to bilateral disputes such as in the case of Cyprus with regard to Turkey and Greece with regard to Macedonia on the issue of the latter country's name.  These disputes are also undermining the credibility of the enlargement policy and show that the EU needs to discuss them in some form to reduce these double standards. <br\/>I briefly alluded to the Russian influence.  The narrative of Russia is affecting human rights issues, including human rights for the gay and lesbian community and ethnic minorities.  This is a further reason for the European Union to take a proactive approach.<br\/>On the use of the carrot and stick, visa liberalisation offers a good example of this approach.  Each of the countries was given a clear list of reforms on border controls, security of documents such as passports, immigration, the rule of law and so forth.  They all implemented these reforms because they knew the reward would be visa free travel.  It is a challenge for the European Union in the enlargement process, which is much longer.  The accession of Croatia took eight years, from 2005 until last year, and the enlargement negotiations have become more complicated.  When Ireland joined the European Economic Community, I believe the <i>acquis <\/i>consisted of some 10,000 pages of legislation.  This has since increased to approximately 180,000 pages of legislation, which must be absorbed in the candidate countries.  How to maintain the attractiveness of enlargement for western Balkan countries is part of the challenge.  While the tools are available, the European Union must use them in a much more effective manner.  This would also strengthen its leverage.  <br\/>The issue of civil society was raised.  I highlighted this matter because it is absolutely fundamental, particularly when one is dealing with societies in transition, such as those in the western Balkans, where institutions are still weak and governments are not accountable to citizens.  Even if civil society organisations are relatively weak in some countries, there are a few organisations at grassroots level which can make a difference and they need to be supported.  The European Union needs to be much more systematic in the support it provides for civil society and the media because this elements strengthen accountability. <br\/>I agree that the European Union must accept its internal weaknesses.  It would be to our credit if we were to do that.  However, the more we allow the disrespect of basic democratic principles to go unsanctioned within the EU, for example, in the case of Hungary, the more we give reasons to small nationalist groups, minorities and oligarchs in the Balkan countries to do whatever they want because they see what is happening in member states.  It behoves the European Union to be much more consistent in our approach in order that the aspiration in the western Balkans to join the European Union is viable and succeeds.  People in the western Balkans realise that there is no future other than as members of the European Union.  We must take advantage of this and work as diligently as possible to ensure their aspirations are eventually realised, even if it takes longer than we would have liked.  I hope I have responded to all the questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111300012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415892900,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fou&eacute;r&eacute; for his fascinating contribution.

Obviously, he may be under pressure in his own country because there is a lot of pressure exerted on those who even remotely criticise President Putin's policies in general.  Mr. Gorbachev's statement was too easy.  While the European Union certainly could have done things in a better way, there is no other way but for the Union and Russia to engage in substantive dialogue and Ukraine to demonstrate that the future does require a more courageous approach in terms of the recognition of language rights and so on.  This can only be done through dialogue.  The major problem is to whom does one talk in the east.  That is why we believe there needs to be an effort to identify those moderate elements whose voices have been drowned out by the self-elected so-called leaders.  This is where the OSCE plays such a critical role.<\/p><p>  I was one of those asked to engage in some mediation coaching for the OSCE special monitoring mission when it was established in April and one of the elements we highlighted was that the OSCE's role was not just to provide objective information on the position on the ground but also to facilitate dialogue between all of the different groups involved.  I agree wholeheartedly that the OSCE, as the only international actor on the ground up to July when the European Union set up its own civilian security sector reform mission which is under way, provides the best possible avenue for promoting the dialogue process and involves Russia.  Russia is part of the OSCE and it is absolutely vital that the efforts of the current chairmanship continue under the next chairmanship, to be held by Serbia.  Ireland, during its chairmanship of the OSCE, placed particular emphasis on the importance of mediation and dialogue - we pushed very hard in the transnistria settlement process - and also the role of civil society.  Ireland has a lot of experience in that field from its history and the Northern Ireland peace process.  Our example was very useful in that respect.

I will make a brief statement and I will respond to any specific issues the committee wishes to address.<\/p><p>  Ulster Bank is the third largest financial institution in the Republic of Ireland.  We are unique as the only systemic bank operating across both the Republic and Northern Ireland that is owned by an international parent with a global network.  We are an integral part of the financial and social economies in both jurisdictions and we believe that a healthy and functioning financial services sector is essential to a vibrant, competitive and sustainable economy.  We recognise and greatly appreciate our role and responsibilities in this regard.<\/p><p>  Ulster Bank has a significant presence across the island of Ireland.  We employ more than 5,500 people in a network of 199 branches and serve almost 2 million customers.  We have lending in excess of &euro;27 billion in the Irish economy and hold approximately &euro;25 billion in customer deposits.  We also hold strong market positions across the business with improving trends in all areas.  Over recent years we have had a clear strategy to manage our legacy issues while at the same time build a really good bank for our customers.  On that point, I reiterate my comments yesterday in accepting the fine imposed by the Central Bank as a result of its findings following the IT incident.  I am pleased to confirm that since then we have invested heavily in both our governance and systems to avoid any similar incident happening again.<\/p><p>  Our strategy is working with a number of tangible results.  First, early this year we returned to profit.  Our must recent quarter 3 results continue to demonstrate this progress, with an adjusted operating profit of &euro;569 million in the year to date.  Most important, these results demonstrate our continued focus on the needs of our customers.<\/p><p>  On business lending, our &euro;1.2 billion Ahead for Business fund has provided almost &euro;1.1 billion of credit into the market to the end of September.  We have just launched a series of new fixed-rate mortgages and we expect to provide approximately &euro;500 million in mortgage financing this year.<\/p><p>  We are also making considerable progress on mortgage arrears and have achieved month-on-month reductions in arrears every month for the past 19 months.  My team and I have constantly, consistently and publicly affirmed our core objective, which is that we want to keep co-operating customers in their homes.  I am pleased to confirm that in excess of 8,000 customers who had been in arrears are now up to date with payments.<\/p> <p> Second, the committee will be aware that Ulster Bank recently passed the comprehensive assessment undertaken by the European Central Bank.  This demonstrates the progress we have made in recent years in strengthening our balance sheet, a process which has continued through 2014.  Since the effective date of the review we have further increased our common equity tier 1 ratio to 17.3%, a figure which we believe to be the strongest capital position of all full-service banks in Ireland.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, the recent announcement by RBS confirming Ulster Bank's core status and good strategic fit with its retail and commercial banking businesses is a key development and proof of a commitment to Ulster Bank as an integral part of RBS.  It is important to note that this decision was based on the assessment that Ulster Bank has strong potential and is capable of making an appropriate return.  Following this commitment, we will continue with a dual strategy of strengthening our market-leading position in Northern Ireland through greater alignment with the United Kingdom while building a challenger bank in Ireland.  Our ambition is to become the No. 1 bank for customer service throughout the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> Before I conclude and take questions, I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our observations on the recent announcement of the Central Bank regarding new mortgage lending.  A rebound in property prices following a crisis is not unusual and we recognise the need for the Central Bank to take steps to avoid overheating in the credit and property markets.  However, the proposals as they stand will impact on the ability of many first-time buyers to acquire homes.  In addition to this, other hopeful first-time buyers will struggle to save a high deposit while paying increasing rents.  We estimate that 68% of the first-time buyer mortgages approved by Ulster Bank this year would have fallen outside the proposed loan-to-value or loan-to-income criteria.  The economy and marketplace in a country such as Ireland are dependent on a fully functioning mortgage market, and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to the consultation on how best to achieve this.<\/p><p> Let me reiterate that Ulster Bank is and will remain an integral part of RBS and is fully committed to the island of Ireland.  Following the comprehensive assessment by the European Central Bank, we believe we hold the strongest capital position of all the full-service banks in Ireland.  We have a clear strategy.  We have returned to profit and we are making strong progress towards becoming a simpler, more efficient and sustainable bank.<\/p><p> We actively support the mortgage and business markets by providing increased lending and specialist sector support.  We look forward to continuing our progress in 2015 and to supporting the recovery in the economy as a challenger bank that provides much-needed competition to the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415873100,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I propose that we adhere to the same rules as for our meetings with the other banks.

Then, anyone else who wishes to ask a question will have five minutes.  The clerk and myself will be keeping an eye on the clock, and I will advise members when there is one minute to go to allow them to wrap up while, hopefully, keeping within their time.  If members have further questions, I will be happy, time permitting, to allow them back in later once I have given others a fair opportunity to put their questions.  It does not serve the purpose of the committee to use the time to make statements and it does not give the witnesses the opportunity to respond properly.

I was disappointed with the questionnaire Ulster Bank returned to us.  The bank appears to have taken a minimalist approach in terms of the responses.  The bank cited commercial sensitivity eight times as a reason for not answering the questions.  It was the last response we received from any of the banks.  I have to say, regrettably, that I regard it as being of the poorest quality.  At times the bank provided web links instead of copying the information, forcing us to go and look up various web pages.  That is disappointing, and I am unsure why the bank took that approach.  Anyway, that is my honest observation.<\/p><p>  I will start by asking Mr. Brown about the fine from the Central Bank of &euro;3.5 million in respect of the information technology failure that occurred in the summer of 2012, which was obviously a major issue for bank's customers.  It was a damning finding by the Central Bank against Ulster Bank.  It found that the bank failed to have robust governance arrangements in respect of IT systems and that this threatened confidence in the operation of the retail banking sector.  The Central Bank said that outsourcing was no defence for regulatory failings.  It saw fit to impose the highest fine it has ever imposed and it reprimanded the bank.  Ulster Bank has accepted the findings.

Furthermore, we have the ability to run the Ulster Bank transactions completely separate from those of the rest of the group.  A significant amount of investment has gone into this.  The investment has been overseen by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is tracking progress to ensure that it is in place as we have committed.<\/p><p>  Separately, we have improved governance within Ulster Bank so that we have better oversight on the IT arrangements that exist in RBS.  We have a specific IT person working for Ulster Bank who is heavily involved in determining the IT priorities for RBS as well as monitoring the performance of the systems and the backup plans, as I have commented previously.  We have seen a considerable amount of work and significant investment, with improved governance in the bank too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1415873100,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Brown confident that the likelihood of a repeat scenario is remote?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300004#C00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415873100,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I am confident, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1415873100,"counter":92,"content":"<p>What was the overall cost of the episode to Ulster Bank?

Why is there such a difference between the cost of variable-rate mortgages in Ireland and those in the North, particularly at low LTV ratios?

I want to express my disappointment at how late we received the bank's information.  I received the replies to our questions yesterday evening.  For the purposes of comparison, we received information from Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and AIB.  It is very disappointing to be given documentation so late in the day because we want to engage meaningfully with this process and it is very important for us to be able to review the questions we spend a lot of time putting together.<\/p><p>  I will not go over the ground covered by my colleagues.  On the variable rate the banks are charging customers, there is a perception, with which the bank needs to deal, that it is making variable rate customers pay for tracker mortgages handed out by the bank when times were good.  From their point of view, the bank holds money belonging to ordinary people in current accounts on which, to the best of my knowledge, they are paid no interest.  The bad debts are reducing and the cost of funds has fallen.  From their point of view, there is no real excuse for continuing to, in effect, screw them.  That is how people see it, and it is something the bank needs to address.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty referred to the level of arrears in the principal dwellings mortgage book.  It is utterly shocking that the bank is engaged in some 5,500 of what could be loosely termed \"legal proceedings\" out of a loan book of 12,723 mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days.  In response to an earlier question it was said that people will not engage in the process until they are on the steps of a court.  That is, in effect, telling people the bank is scaring them into participating in a process to resolve mortgage arrears, a scenario for which many people see the bank being as culpable as they are.<\/p><p>  I spent years working as a solicitor.  For every mortgage product I handled, the bank did an independent valuation, paid for by the customer.  The customer paid for the cost of executing the mortgage deed and registering the bank's interest.  The proportion of cases in which the bank is engaging in legal proceedings is inordinately high and is much higher than that of the other financial institutions which have come before the committee.  The bank needs to examine its internal processes.<\/p> <p>This committee prepared a report on mortgage arrears and resolution processes and the clerk will give Mr. Brown a copy of that.  It made several good recommendations which Ulster Bank should take on board, not least the AIB initiative to have an independent group of advisers to facilitate the re-engagement of customers with the process.  All lenders should consider that proposal and fund it as AIB does.  Ulster Bank has a problem if it is using legal proceedings against 5,000 out of 12,000 customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300007#F02100","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415875500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>That is almost 50%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300008#G00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1415875500,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Having been engaged with the law for many years I know how distressing it is for people to have to engage in legal proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300008#G00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415875500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I understand that and we take this issue very seriously.

It is so slow that people actually go into arrears, even though they have given plenty of notice of problems.  Customers are further disadvantaged by Ulster Bank in having its telephone operations based in Scotland.  Does the delegation agree with this?  A customer in difficulty tries to make a deal for a restructuring with the arrears support unit in the bank.  However, because the restructuring is not agreed to quickly enough, the customer falls into arrears and is then hassled by another wing of the bank&rsquo;s operation for a payment he or she cannot afford - never the two wings shall meet.  The stress this heaps on people is unbelievable.  Just in the past week I have had cases of Ulster Bank customers in mortgage difficulty getting four text messages and telephone calls every day.

Just before Deputy Boyd Barrett came into the room, we indicated to the Chairman that where a customer can show evidence that they are eligible for social housing, we would support them with a voluntary assisted sale and not chase the shortfall that may be left over after the property is sold.  We are trying to offer everything we can to make this an accessible problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300011#K02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1415877300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>What about the mortgage-to-rent scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300011#K02900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415877300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>It is a completely over-engineered bureaucratic disaster.

The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Duffy will make some opening remarks.  In advance of the meeting, we collated questions from members of the committee and submitted these to Allied Irish Banks.  I thank Mr. Duffy and his staff for responding in writing to them, particularly promptly I might add.  These responses have been distributed to members and together with the input of the witnesses today, I hope that all the key topics will have been covered.

I will try to be brisk in my summary to allow as much time as possible for the questions.<\/p><p>  As members are aware, AIB is a listed company on the Irish Stock Exchange and consequently, the comments we make today regarding the possible performance of the bank in particular should not be considered as forward guidance and nor should they be considered a solicitation to buy shares in the bank.  As the Vice Chairman noted, we have submitted responses to the questions sent to the bank by the Oireachtas and have endeavoured to answer the questions as fully as possible within the confines of the disclosure requirements imposed by our listing rules.  We also have submitted a short presentation, which summarises the recent financial performance of the bank.<\/p><p>  Next month, it will have been three years since I joined the bank as chief executive and this is the fourth occasion since I took up the role that we have had the opportunity to meet the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We find it to be a most valuable forum in which to explain our performance and, on this occasion, my team and I are presenting a picture that is in sharp and positive contrast to our first meeting with the joint committee back in October 2012.  At that meeting, we outlined a three-year strategic plan to restore our stability, achieve sustainable growth and return to profitability.  This involved fundamental and major organisational change, restructuring, deleveraging and the introduction of a much-reduced cost base.  We were obliged to restructure the balance sheet, overhaul our funding and lending profiles, rebuild credibility with the funding markets, meet restructuring targets and position the bank for prudent loan growth.  In 2012, we focused on restructuring the business across all elements of the bank, from the balance sheet size and structure to cost-reduction programmes.  In 2013, we focused the energy and direction of the bank on rebuilding our relationships with all our customers and on the external commercial agenda, while seeing improvements in the operating performance of the bank.  This year, in 2014, we have been in a position to focus on prudent lending growth and profitability while at the same time accelerating our progress on dealing with customers in arrears.<\/p><p>  We are happy to be here today to demonstrate the degree of the bank&rsquo;s recovery and the benefit this will bring to our customers and to the wider Irish economy.  In summary, AIB is now a profitable business that is generating capital, has received European Union approval for our restructuring plan, has passed the European Central Bank, ECB, stress tests without the requirement for additional capital from the State, sees reducing arrears levels and overall levels of impaired loans and is well-positioned from a funding, capital and liquidity perspective to grow prudently the bank&rsquo;s loan book over time and support economic recovery.  To be more specific, this year we returned to profit before tax with &euro;437 million generated in the first half of 2014, which is a &euro;1.3 billion improvement in performance over the first half of 2013.  To the end of September, total impaired loans reduced by circa &euro;4.6 billion, which is a 16% drop since December 2013, with the total number of accounts in arrears in the Irish residential mortgage portfolio declining by 11% and arrears for owner-occupier mortgages down by 15%.<\/p><p>  Members will be aware that at the end of last month, AIB passed the European-wide stress testing exercise conducted by the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the Central Bank of Ireland.  Under the comprehensive assessment, AIB&rsquo;s capital buffers were comfortably above minimum requirements under all stress test assessment scenarios.  Passing the stress tests was an important event for AIB and the Irish economy.  It was not just confirmation of the bank&rsquo;s current capital position but was an important external validation that the bank is equipped and capitalised to deal with future shocks should they arise.  On Monday last, 10 November, AIB&rsquo;s interim management statement covering the quarter to 30 September 2014 showed a continuation of the company&rsquo;s half-year results.  The statement indicated that the overall operating performance of AIB was ahead of expectations in the year to date.  The bank&rsquo;s profitable trend was maintained, generating additional capital in the third quarter of the year.  A copy of this information has been sent to the joint committee.<\/p><p>  Lending to customers is of course the true test of our financial health and is critical to our future growth and Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  While there is much conjecture as to the appetite for banks to lend in the economy, I want to be clear that AIB is seeking to increase its lending and has the ability to do so.<\/p> <p>Bearing in mind the lessons from the recent past, this does not mean that we will approve all applications but it does mean that we have the appetite to support viable lending opportunities at competitive lending rates which reflect the cost of operating our business, the risk associated with lending in a recovering economy and the need to generate a commercial return for shareholders.<\/p><p> AIB approved lending of approximately &euro;9 billion in the first nine months of 2014 and this is a 39% increase on the same period in the previous year.  As such, AIB is on track to exceed its &euro;7 billion to 10 billion lending approvals target for 2014.  AIB has leading market shares in Ireland across our personal, small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, and corporate businesses.  AIB is the No. 1 bank in Ireland for start-ups, it is the largest lender to the agri-sector and it has numerous active funds to support lending and economic recovery as part of our dedicated sector specialist approach to our customers.<\/p><p> New lending drawdowns of approximately &euro;4 billion in the first nine months of the year represented a 40% increase on the same period in 2013.  These figures are reflective not only of the improving economic backdrop in our main markets of Ireland and the UK but also speak to the underlying ability of the bank to lend prudently to our customers.  As AIB continues to return to more normalised operations, the leadership team and I are strongly of the view that this should benefit customers whilst striking a balance with ensuring the bank is operating commercially and generating a return for shareholders who are, ultimately, taxpayers.  To this end, and as a result of the bank's underlying positive performance and funding cost reductions, AIB, EBS and Haven recently announced a number of reductions to variable and fixed interest rates for owner-occupier mortgages.  The move benefits approximately 146,000 existing mortgage account holders.  For example, customers with a &euro;200,000 mortgage will save up to &euro;334 per annum, based on a 25-year term.<\/p><p> We remain very conscious of the need to bring debt resolution and certainty to our SME customers in difficulty.  We are accelerating activity in this area and are meeting targets for restructuring.  Facilitating SME customers to return to more manageable debt levels and moving onto a growth curve requires intensive one-to-one engagement but we are seeing tangible results and this is reflected in our financial results and in the reduction in the level of impaired loans on the bank's balance sheet.  Likewise with mortgages in arrears, increased customer engagement is evident and the overall economic upturn means we are now seeing a reduction in mortgage arrears and in the overall levels of impaired loans.<\/p><p> We have engaged in a project with the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, that offers customers in difficulty an alternative avenue of dealing with the bank.  The scheme, announced a year ago, allows customers in difficulty with their mortgage repayments to avail of the independent third party services of the IMHO to advise clients and engage with the bank on their behalf.  The initiative is available free of charge to AIB Group customers, including those with EBS and Haven, who are experiencing residential mortgage difficulties.  Solutions offered and concluded with our customers, whether through the IMHO or directly through our own arrears management unit, are fundamentally based on the principle of maximum affordability for the customer.  Whether regarding SMEs or mortgages, the solutions we are agreeing with our customers in difficulty are based on a principle of maximum affordability and are being concluded on commercial terms.<\/p><p> While the bank has made progress in recent years, we recognise that a number of challenges lie ahead and that overall personal and business debt levels and the number of impaired loans in the economy are still elevated.  We will continue to focus on rebuilding the trust and confidence of our customers and improving our customer service levels.  Additionally, as a commercial organisation we are focused on generating competitive returns for shareholders over time.  It is a core principle of the bank to treat all of our customers, including those in arrears, on an equitable and fair basis, regardless of their circumstances and their position in society.  This principle is vital to the long term sustainability of AIB.<\/p><p> In summary, on behalf of the bank, I want to again express thanks to the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here today.  We have implemented changes to our approach based on previous Oireachtas sessions and I genuinely view this as an invaluable element of shaping the bank's thinking and strategy.  Members will appreciate that, as a public company with a commercial mandate, we have to balance the requirement of generating value for our shareholders, principally Irish taxpayers, with the requirements of our customers who also support the bank.  Meanwhile, I reiterate that everyone in the bank, including the board, the leadership team, our workforce and myself, will continue to seek to prudently grow the business commercially for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the wider economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415878800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.

We are here to ask hard questions and I am sure they understand this.<\/p><p>  I first want to address the ownership and capital structure of the bank.  There has been much speculation that the Government will seek to sell a stake in AIB in the market at some point in 2015.  I think the State's priority should be to recoup as much as possible of the money it invested in AIB.  It amounts to almost &euro;21 billion and, preferably, it should all be recouped.  How can the State best achieve this objective?  When will AIB start paying dividends to shareholders?  Have shareholders been consulted on the future ownership of the bank and the possible sale of a stake?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300014#N00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415878800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I shall address those points in turn.  As chief executive, I believe AIB will return the full amount that the State invested.  This will take time but we expect to do so.  Regarding the sale of a stake in AIB and the timing thereof, we have stated consistently that we must deliver a three-year recovery that ends in 2014.  The aim has always been to be able to say by the end of 2014 that AIB is a profitable, well capitalised bank without concerns regarding State funding.  We passed the European Commission tests, delivered on the associated targets and are a functioning lender in the economy - all of the elements one expects from a functioning bank.  On delivery of our full year's results for 2014 we will be able to say AIB is investable and this is the first and most critical hurdle on entering a sale process.<\/p><p>  We engage with investors from an education perspective, rather than a sale perspective, to keep them abreast of the performance of the bank and the economy in concert.  We are engaged with the Department in a discussion about two things.  First, we must understand the capital structure and how it can be addressed.  Second, we must discuss the capital requirement with the European regulator and the domestic regulator.  Until these two matters are entirely clear it is impossible to come up with a defined series of actions around them.  We expect that during December 2014 there will be further clarity on this capital from the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, and the Central Bank.  Once we have clarity we can decide how to treat prefs, CoCos and any issuance in the market.  Only when such matters are clear, in terms of the balance sheet, will investors be willing to invest.  AIB will not determine the exact timing of an investment as the shareholder unit of the Department of Finance will make that decision to obtain maximum value and inform us of same.  Our obligation is to be ready upon receipt of instructions from the shareholder unit to execute the mandate.  We will be ready as of the first quarter of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1415878800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I take it, then, that the bank is in discussion with the Department of Finance about the capital structure of AIB and it is expected there will be an exercise to tidy the capital structure.

What we have is a governance model alongside a risk appetite that is defined and agreed at the board level rather than the executive level.  What one can do in each bucket and the independence of the risk head are the two vital criteria for risk management.  One adds to this the forensic lens of the external accountants.

Some of the response to date has been most disappointing.<\/p><p>  I commend AIB on the work that is ongoing with the IMHO.  It is really constructive and it is working well.  Where my concern lies is with the significant amount of impaired SME loans that are still on AIB's books.  I am sure it has already been mentioned, but, as I understand it from the answers AIB has given, &euro;4.4 billion is the current amount of impaired loans on its books.  I welcome the fact that this has decreased by 9% since December 2013, but I wonder whether any thought is being given to an IMHO-style solution whereby business owners can have some form of independent representation.<\/p><p>  Obviously, one of the biggest drags on the economy is this overhang of debt for business.  The growth in the economy that we have seen to date is largely led by exports and foreign direct investment, not by the indigenous economy.  There is a real need, and an interest, for banks to do something about that.  Even with the new legislation, the examinership process is not working for SMEs. It is too expensive.

If one takes out the consumer mortgages, we deal with approximately &euro;20 billion worth of challenged debt, most of which is impaired, while some is not.  The figures referred to by Mr. Bourke earlier relate to a reduction of approximately &euro;4.5 billion in that impaired debt over the past nine months.  That &euro;4.5 billion has come about through restructurings with customers and recognising that some of the debt will not be recoverable, so write-downs are in place.  As of the end of September, we have made offers in respect of approximately &euro;16 billion of that &euro;20 billion worth of debt, so we have issued heads of terms to these customers, 80% to 85% of which are accepted.  We will more than likely end up in a legal resolution with the rest.  There is quite a strong advisory core out there, but one is largely dealing with non-core debt, so it does not lend itself to examinership.  It also has a very entangled nature between personal property and buy-to-let and is sometimes wrapped up in pension mortgages and SMEs.  We would expect that by the end of next year we will have not only offered everybody a resolution but, ultimately, restructured, documented, fulfilled and drawn down those restructures in large part.  We have made a very significant amount of progress in the past nine months and now that activity is manifesting itself as the reduction in non-performing loans that one sees on the balance sheet today.  They are restructured drawn deals under which, subject to performance, customers will be able to get on with the rest of their lives and start their businesses or do whatever they need to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014111300021#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1415883000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Would the bank consider some sort of independent entity for SME debt along the lines of the IMHO?

It also has an appeal from a consumer protection point of view.  Three elements need to be borne in mind on the other side.  First, such arrangements generally operate in a repossessions market in which there is very quick execution between somebody defaulting and a house repossession and a realisation of a loss taking place.  Therefore, the insurer is able to understand what the loss is and provide insurance.  It is less structured and less used to a market like the Irish market, in which a solution is worked through over a long period of time, in effect, in the absence of a loss event.  It is not that it could not happen, but it is certainly not designed in that way.  Second, there is a price to it and that price factors in the risk involved.  Rather than getting rid of the risk, one is simply moving the point of risk.  Third, under the current construct, these arrangements generally tend in effect to have a go-back-to-borrower clause.  The insurer might pay up, but it will seek recovery from the borrower.  <\/p><p>  I suggest these three thoughts should be specifically borne in mind.

Our view is that there are many examples of what we have been through and the many solutions that have been applied.   Each market is different and we should learn as much as possible.  In any submission we take this into account.  In a country this small and with such a proper drive waiting in its economy we must have a conservative approach to long-term stability.  That said, there should not be a law of unintended consequences.  One is dealing with a policy which, in principle, is absolutely fine.  The question is whether the numbers are fixed and can never change.  The real question concerns how to execute that change and prevent any single class from being disintermediated for 40 years, as the Deputy suggested.  How does one effect the transition?  We will come up with some response in the consultation along the lines of establishing a point of real policy and principle that could be applied to the circumstances and varied accordingly.  This should be kept under review, which is what we would do in the case of anything else.  Perhaps we might have a meeting of minds on the best way to apply the principles in transition.  It may never get to 20; it may stay at 15, or it may get to 17; I do not know.

It can be very problematic for many tenants when rent receivers are appointed to properties.  Some of the behaviour of rent receivers is appalling.  The committee's document on mortgage arrears and a more recent report from the Private Residential Tenancies Board by DKM Economic Consultants, Red C Research and Marketing and Ronan Daly Jermyn Solicitors have suggested the legislation be amended to clarify the role of receivers in their stepping into the shoes of landlords.  This is to avoid scenarios where rents are being paid but where basic repairs are not being carried out, for example, or where there are legal evictions of tenants because some lenders in the current market &mdash; I am not suggesting which ones &mdash; want properties back quickly without giving appropriate notice to the tenants.

We are very supportive of more competition in the market.  The debate has become confused because people believe we have exorbitant margins.  I have pointed out that the ECB rate is not the reference point; it is 3% of our deposits; therefore, we are making thin margins, while trying to guarantee a shareholder return, even at the point to which we have reduced the current rates.  If one starts out with a premise that one is not profiteering, one has a very different funding rate from the rest of Europe.  Recovering bad credit with a view to trying to borrow on the market and lend is our reality, for which there is no benchmark in the rest of Europe.  Therefore, I am not sure the competition issue will change everything that much.  For the long-term health of the economy, there will be a need for more competition.  This will come from non-bank providers.  Some 80% of SME lending in Ireland is with banks, but some 80% of SME lending in America is with non-banks.  Therefore, the dynamic of the model will change.  Internet lending providers will enter the market in force and scale and this will result in a different form of competition.  It is not always just about another bank in a geographical location.  The competition will come over time.  Ulster Bank is staying, as has been made public, and one will see Permanent TSB drive recovery with strength; one will also see Internet providers.  Banks such as RaboDirect are offering a direct channel.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the Joint Committee on Health and Children in support of its quarterly review of my Department's work.<\/p><p>  On the last occasion when I appeared before the committee in July, it was less than a week since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I found the experience to be a useful induction into the broad range of issues within my Department's remit.  <\/p><p>  I want to bring the committee up to date on the full range of developments in my Department in the past quarter.  I hope that the comprehensive responses which I have already provided to the written questions submitted by the members of this committee in advance of today's session will assist its examination of the issues concerned and will assist our discussion today.<\/p><p>  In these opening remarks I wish to mention a number of key developments among the priority areas of the Department since our last session.  These include: budget 2015; update on the national children detention facilities project at Oberstown; progress on our legislative programme; developments towards the commission to inquire into the mother and baby homes; implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020; and steps towards the appointment of a new Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>  The 2015 Estimate for my Department demonstrates that, while operating under difficult budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reform and service developments to support Ireland's children and families.  I am fully committed to ensuring real reform of child welfare and protection services and making this country a better and safer place to be a child or young person.<\/p><p>  There are two elements to my Department's Vote which amounts to &euro;1.01 billion or &euro;1,010 million in 2015.  The Estimate for next year contains significant additional resources to fund the services and programmes provided by the Child and Family Agency.  In 2015 the agency will have a budget of &euro;635 million including more than &euro;12 million in capital funding.  This is an increase of &euro;26 million, or 4.3%, over the 2014 provision.<\/p> <p>The balance of &euro;375 million relates to other programmes funded directed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In 2015 my Department will provide &euro;260 million to support the child care sector to enable children and parents to access high quality and affordable child care.  The total number of children benefiting from support under the child care programmes is more than 100,000.  I am pleased to say there will be no reduction in the &euro;50 million funding for youth services in 2015, which was a key priority for youth organisations.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware that the Child and Family Agency, established on 1 January 2014, represented one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  It involved the bringing together of almost 3,800 staff from three organisations, the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The coming together of services under one roof has provided a platform for the delivery of a more efficient and effective service to vulnerable children and families.  The overall level of funding of &euro;635 million which will be made available to the agency in 2015 is significant by any measurement.  It is to ensure the agency can provide a comprehensive and integrated service for children and families who require support.  Notwithstanding the additional resources provided and the prioritisation of these services by the Government, it is acknowledged that delivering the range of services required of the agency is challenging as a result of demographic and social factors.  Operational reforms are ongoing to achieve the most effective utilisation of existing resources.  In addition, the agency has been working to bring added controls in the area of legal services and continues to develop its approach to the commissioning of services.  My Department has in place a strong system of performance monitoring, with monthly and quarterly performance closely monitored in key areas, including finance, HR and service activity levels.<\/p><p> The practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities is not one modern society should tolerate, which is why ending this practice is a core programme for Government commitment.  Work is nearing completion on the first three residential units which will facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the children detention schools.  In addition to the &euro;56 million capital project to develop new national children detention facilities, the allocation of &euro;1.8 million in current expenditure in 2015 will provide for the increased operational costs of the extended Oberstown facilities under its expanded role.  Some 24 new care staff arrived at the Oberstown campus in October for initial training and orientation.  This is the first increase in staffing for the children detention school system for many years.<\/p><p> The legal framework for the detention of children is also being updated and the heads of a Bill for amendments to the Children Act 2001 were recently approved by the Cabinet.  Drafting work is under way.  The Bill will provide for the legal amalgamation of the three existing children detention schools and the repeal of all current legal provisions which permit the detention of children in the adult prison system.  I am committed to working with campus management and its board of management to ensure the current change programme in the children detention school system is completed successfully. <\/p><p> A key priority in my Department's legislative programme is the Children First Bill.  The committee will be aware that I intend that the Bill will advance to Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in this session.  The Children First interdepartmental group is also pursuing implementation issues generally at this time and revised national guidance is being developed with the passage of the Bill.<\/p><p> I am pleased to inform the committee that I intend to seek Government approval for the draft heads of an adoption (information and tracing) Bill and referral of that Bill to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I have already submitted a written response to a Member's question on this legislation in which I outline the progressive approach I wish to take to provide for access to as much information as possible and as legally possible for adopted persons.  I hope to be in a position to introduce the Adoption (Amendment) Bill following on from the children's rights referendum, subject to the outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings on that referendum.  It is expected that the outcome of the Supreme Court's deliberations will be available in the early part of next year.<\/p><p> I have received the committee's report on the proposed legislative provisions in respect of aftercare and will give careful attention to this important input before I seek the approval of the Government to draft the Bill.  I express my gratitude to the committee for its important input into this vital matter.<\/p><p> My Department has ongoing engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality on its progressing of the Children and Family Relationships Bill, the general scheme of which was approved by the Government in September 2014.  The Bill will involve amendments to the Adoption Act 2010 in respect of adoption by cohabiting couples - both same and opposite sex couples - and also in respect of step-parent adoption.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, the Government has undertaken to establish a statutory commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.  It is essential that the commission be provided with comprehensive and precise terms of reference from the outset.  The tasks to be undertaken and the appropriate range of methodologies to be utilised must be defined to ensure the commission is set up on a sound footing.  Given the level of cross-party and public interest in these maters, I am anxious to achieve the widest possible consensus at this crucial stage of the process.  I am engaging further with Opposition spokespersons and other stakeholders in order to update them on the emerging issues and seek any further view they may have.  Such an inclusive approach will assist the Government in establishing an effective inquiry and I am confident that we can conclude this important phase of the process in a timely manner.  Following the finalisation of the terms of reference, it is my intention to bring a memorandum to the Government as soon as possible thereafter, setting out the arrangements for the commission.  I will then be in a position to return to both Houses with a draft resolution seeking Oireachtas approval to establish the commission.<\/p><p> In September the Government approved my proposal that the third optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child be signed and ratified by Ireland.  The protocol provides for a communication procedure between citizens of participating states and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  This move will give children in Ireland a route to the committee to hear complaints on the violation of their rights.  This new development underpins a range of Government initiatives to strengthen children's rights.  They include the establishment of a dedicated Department to advance children's rights and the establishment of the Child and Family Agency to consolidate and enhance service provision for children and families.  It is important in all we do that the child's voice is heard.<\/p><p> A particular focus of the early years quality agenda since the meeting in July has been establishing a national approach to providing support for early years services to help them to improve their quality.  The initiative involves bringing together the work done by local child care committees and also by voluntary organisations with a new strand of support, the Early Years Specialist Service.  The specialist service will work with a small number of services at a time, helping them to self-evaluate and work on improvements.  All of the quality support work will be underpinned by a practice toolkit which is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The national manager was appointed in July and has been focusing on the establishment of the Early Years Specialist Service.  Some 30 specialists have been recruited and are being trained.  This is a very exciting development, one which will be of real benefit to services on the ground as it is rolled out.  It is welcome that the organisations delivering quality supports have been so willing to come together in the interests of services and the children who use them.  It is a reflection of the fact that there is widespread recognition that providing this support in a consistent way nationally is key to improvements in the future.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, my Department is leading the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Future, the first whole of government strategy for children and young people aged 0 to 24 years.  The framework sets out key outcomes for children and young people on which the Government and wider society will focus attention to ensure we optimise the best outcomes for young people.  The aim and ambition of the strategy are significant and I am pleased to inform the committee that considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the framework.  It includes the establishment and convening of the cross-Government consortium to oversee implementation, the establishment of the sponsors group of key Departments with lead responsibility for the five national outcomes, the preparation of an implementation plan for the framework, the identification process for annual priority areas of work to be progressed by each sponsor, as well as the establishment of an advisory council, chaired by Dr. Owen Keenan, which will provide a platform for members of civil society to engage with other structures of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures in order to actively support and guide its implementation.<\/p> <p>The first meeting took place last week.<\/p><p> Both the infrastructure and process involved in Better Outcomes Brighter Futures are proving to be an effective model for whole-of-government working.  It indicates the clear benefits of ensuring co-ordinated and coherent policy for children and young people to ensure the best outcomes, and I am committed to actively driving this innovative initiative and ensuring that the Cabinet committee on social policy is informed of progress.<\/p><p> I recently announced the competitive process to recruit a new Ombudsman for Children.  Members will be aware that the outgoing Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, vacated her position on 1 October 2014 to take up a new position as chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and I wish her well in the post.  The vacant position will be filled by an open, competitive process as advertised by the Public Appointments Service on 31 October 2014.  The process is along similar lines to the process which resulted in the recruitment of Ms Logan as the first holder of the office in 2003.  I am particularly pleased with the extent to which children will play a role in the process.  Children were involved in developing the person specification for the role and the advertisement for the position.<\/p><p> I recently attended the two consultation events on 20 and 21 October which were both immensely valuable and highly enjoyable.  It was great to see children participating in such a novel way to help in the selection of the person whose primary function is to advocate for their rights.  A panel of children has also been selected to work with the Public Appointments Service on developing, conducting and evaluating a role play with candidates and in participating in the final interview and selection process.  I have confidence that the Public Appointments Service has significant experience and expertise to conduct a professional and impartial selection process that will identify the most suitable candidate for this important role on behalf of children in Ireland.  Shortlisting and preliminary interviews will be concluded before the end of 2014 with the final interviews to take place in early January.  I hope to have Government approval to submit a motion to both Houses seeking approval to recommend the successful candidate for appointment in the first week the Houses resume sitting in 2015.<\/p><p> Regarding the commission, I have met some members of the Opposition and must meet others in the coming weeks.  We are very keen to have an inclusive process and that the terms of reference allow for a timely and sensitive inquiry that will report and answer the questions that many people need answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300003#D00700","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415874000,"counter":617,"content":"<p>The committee looks forward to playing its role in any legislation that comes our way and assisting the Minister and Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300005#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1415874000,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I am glad he clarified that he must still consult a number of members of the Opposition on the mother and baby homes.  What is the delay?  While I agree with the Minister that we must be sensitive and get this right, we told the people who suffered terribly at the hands of those who ran these institutions many years ago that an independent investigation would be established before the summer recess.  We are almost at the Christmas recess and the Minister still has not given a definitive date for the publication of the terms of reference of the investigation.  Can he give the committee a commitment that it will be done by Christmas, that it will be an inclusive investigation and that all institutions that were involved in the practices in question will be covered by the investigation?<br\/>Regarding guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, GALs, the Minister will agree that vetting is an integral part of child protection.  There is no comprehensive system regarding the vetting of GALs.  On Sunday I heard on an RTE radio show that the Courts Service has reluctantly agreed to vet the GAL system on a temporary basis.  The Minister replied to my parliamentary question on how he would rationalise the service.  There is still serious spending on this service at a time, confirmed in replies to questions I submitted, when not every child in care has a dedicated social worker.  We still have savage expenditure on the GAL system at a time when not every child in care has a care plan.  This is morally wrong and the Minister should prioritise bringing about a system that rationalises the service.  I ask the Minister to give a definitive timeframe as to when it will be presented to the members of the committee in order that we can have an input into it.<br\/>While the Minister got additional funding in this year's budget for Tusla, it comes nowhere near what the CEO of Tusla has requested to run the organisation.  Before the budget, he said he needed an additional &euro;45 million just to stand still, not to do anything better.  How can the Minister be confident that Tusla will carry out its obligations effectively when the CEO says it will not have enough money to do so?<br\/>Cyberbullying is not mentioned in the Minister's script and it falls between two Departments, as the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a role to play.  There was, quite rightly, concern about this area with the news that Ask.fm plans to relocate to Ireland.  While I am not saying it is the answer to all ills, I produced a report on foot of the independent rapporteur's report last year which identified a legal vacuum regarding cyberbullying.  Nothing has happened since the report was published 12 months ago.  The Minister might tell the committee when the 2013 report might be published, considering we are almost into 2015.  It is a very serious and real issue with serious consequences for the victims but no consequences for the perpetrators.  Unfortunately, teenagers have lost their lives as a result of cyberbullying and the Minister must prioritise it.  We must address what an independent expert has identified as a legal vacuum in the legislative process to deal with it.<br\/>The early years strategy was announced over two years ago and it was promised that it was coming shortly.  The sector has been operating without a strategic plan since 2010.  What is the delay?  Why can we not have a strategic plan for the sector?  We have a fully dedicated Department and there should not be a delay.  We all will have read the letter in the newspaper this week about a family in the south of Ireland who are struggling and put to the pin of their collar.  I do not believe the Government is prioritising the cost of child care.  In the last budget there was no meaningful proposal on how we will deal with the cost of child care.  A recent OECD report identified Ireland as the country with the highest child care costs, and nothing is being done to address the issue.  When the Donegal county child care committee published a report 12 months ago, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, said she would review the existing schemes administered by her Department in terms of what greater support we can provide.  However, we have done nothing about it.  It is a priority issue, and I eagerly await the Minister's reply on how he intends to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300005#F00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1415874000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  The Minister might indicate the status of filling the vacant Secretary General position in his Department.<\/p> <p> Regarding the issue of the mother and baby homes inquiry, I believe that everyone of us would be disappointed that the terms of reference have not been finalised, that the commission has not been established and that the work is under way.  However, I will add that I would much rather that the terms of reference were right and inclusive and that all of the required preparatory work was done and done properly.  Therefore, I can be patient.  I expect that every effort is being made to expedite this process and I have to take what the Minister says on face value.  I note in his reply to my Question No. 22, also submitted by Deputy Clare Daly and with a shared response, that he talks about the work of developing the terms of reference now being well advanced and that he will finalise his deliberations in early course.  I respectfully ask the Minister to give the committee a sense as to when he expects to have finality, when he expects to go to Cabinet and when he will then come before the Houses with regard to the establishment of the commission and its terms of reference.<\/p><p> I refer to the appointment of Judge Yvonne Murphy as chair of the independent investigation.  The Minister may not wish to elaborate on some of the detail that I will ask of him and I will leave it to himself to respond.  I wish to record my strong support for the establishment of a commission of investigation that was made up of a number of expert panellists, not only Judge Murphy.  I ask the Minister to comment if it is indeed intended to have a wider number of people than a single appointee, as has happened in some of the tribunals in the past.<\/p><p> I am keenly aware of and have strenuously emphasised to the Minister and his predecessors the importance of including the Bethany homes, the Magdalen laundries and the county homes.  I am respectful of what the Minister may not yet be in a position to confirm but I ask him to expand on his intentions in relation to inclusiveness.  I ask if he would be in a position to advise if he has completed the further round of engagements with a number of non-governmental organisations, specifically the Adoption Rights Alliance, the representatives of the bodies I have just mentioned, the Bethany homes and the Magdalen laundries and others we have discussed recently.  What progress has the Minister made with regard to those engagements?<\/p><p> It is very important that we get to a starting point where we can all properly record our full support for the process that will be set in train.  I assure the Minister it is my intention - if what he will present ticks those boxes - to be fully supportive.  That is always my disposition in relation to matters not only in this regard, but right across the board.  I hope that there will not be any need or cause for any discontent.  However, far more important than any discontent that I could voice would be the discontent of those who would feel excluded and marginalised, thus compounding a hurt and pain that they have endured historically.  It is on their behalf that I make this further appeal to the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p> I have no hesitation in acknowledging that both the Minister and his officials are, in my view, doing all that they have to do.  I wish to record my appreciation of the meetings we have had and of those with his predecessors and with his departmental representatives.  This is the spirit in which we are approaching this task.<\/p><p> I refer to the Minister's response to Question No. 21 regarding the serious under-provision of social workers for children deemed at risk and those in State care.  I note his corrected reply to Deputy Seamus Healy regarding the appointment of 130 social workers since the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  Has the service lost social workers in that period?  Is it a net gain of 130 social workers?  Are some of the additional 193 posts yet to be advertised?  I would hope that there is the widest possible awareness of the opportunity to take up social work positions with the Child and Family Agency.  I ask the media reporting on this committee to take the opportunity to signal that there are vacancies for social work positions.  I would wish that it would be greater than the 193 signalled as further additional posts currently on offer to candidates.<\/p><p> The Minister has confirmed 9,548 cases waiting to be allocated a dedicated social worker and approximately one third of these - 3,240 cases - were deemed to be high priority.  Since we last met and since we last addressed these quite disturbing statistics, we have had the tragic situation of the death of young Hassan Khan, a two year old boy.  I do not know who within the Child and Family Agency was directly involved but I would be absolutely confident that the young boy's case was known to Tusla employees, including, I expect, social workers, and that those who were exposed to his story prior to his tragic death would be hugely upset.  I am very conscious of their upset and I will not now or in the future contribute to a compounding of their upset.  However, it is very important that we have some understanding of the extent of that engagement.  We need to know because it is only through knowledge that we will learn the deficiencies within the system.  Had young Hassan Khan a dedicated social worker?  Will Mr. Jeyes expand on his public commentary which is very minute, thus far?  An indication of working with the investigative body is absolutely what we would expect but as a committee and as elected voices who are directly engaged in health and children issues, we have a responsibility to be able to apprise the effectiveness of the systems we have put in place. <\/p> <p>If the witnesses are not in a position to shed further light on the extent of the engagement with the young child, I ask that they would undertake to have the information regarding the case brought to the attention of members of the committee.  I respectfully request that it could be done at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300005#F00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415875200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>As always, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is very welcome, as are his officials.  I acknowledge the considerable strides that have been made in recent years in the area of children.  We should not forget that when we consider the strategy, the agency and the many commitments.  My impatience is due for the need for us to move to the implementation and outcomes for children to ensure the changes have the effect we want, and that we are not just discussing it on paper.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to Children First.  Could he explain the reason for the delay in the legislation?  I followed the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il at the end of April and I would have thought the Bill would move quickly to Committee Stage.  I wish to understand the reason we cannot move further because a statutory basis is particularly important in so many areas.<\/p><p>  The second area I wish to raise relates to how the committee interacts with the Child and Family Agency.  I asked the Minister and the previous Minister if we could have a formal engagement.  It would be logical for us to do that in the context of the periodic review with the Minister.  It is absolutely critical that we have a very clear and structured engagement with the Child and Family Agency.  It is not good enough that we have seen the agency only once this year and it is now November.  I wish to put that on record.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the response I received to Question No. 11 which was about homeless children.  We read that any child under the age of 16 will go into care and 16 year olds and 17 year olds are &ldquo;typically more challenging&rdquo;.  I refer to young people who leave care settings.  They are more challenging because we as a State have failed them on so many occasions.  We have added to their challenges.  They probably do not have the mental health supports they need or access to the services they need.  They have been failed on several occasions and we continue to fail them by not having the aftercare Bill, to which I know the Minister is committed.  The committee reviewed the heads of the Bill very quickly.  We must move much more quickly on the issue and ensure that every child is addressed.<\/p><p>  It is remiss of us that there are homeless children in the country.  We should not accept that.  We should get out of the rut of accepting that a certain number of children will be homeless.  We must see whether we can do more.  I would encourage the Minister to put in place the aftercare Bill.  That is part of the reason for wanting engagement with the agency.  We must consider what else we can do to ensure children do not get to that precarious situation where we have to read about them in the review panel reports.<\/p><p>  I raised child and adolescent mental health services in the Seanad again with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, because I continue to be concerned about social workers not being able to access the services in a timely and appropriate way.  She said she now questions her judgment about whether the service should be moved into the Child and Family Agency.  We must ensure the services are in place.<\/p><p>  I welcome that the heads of the adoption Bill are due.  The difficulty is that in January 2012 the then Minister told us the Bill was forthcoming.  For that reason I co-sponsored a Bill with Senators Power and Healy Eames on information on identify which is due to go before the Seanad next Wednesday.  We have worked hard to strike a balance.  I hope the Minister will give us a fair hearing.  Many people are waiting for information on their identity.  The difficulty is that for those who wish to make contact, many of the women are getting older as time ticks on and I am most concerned with the delay on this important issue.<\/p><p>  When will the 2013 special rapporteur report be published?  In response to Deputy Pringle in October, the Minister said it was his intention to lay it before the House in the near future.  I accept the Bill has gone out to consultation to the various Departments but when will the Bill be published.  In addition, will it show which recommendations are being accepted by Departments or on which they wish to take a different approach?  I raised the issue with the then Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, last year.  We are on the seventh special rapporteur report.  The reports are valuable but how do we know what happens to the recommendations they contain?<\/p><p>  The final issue relates to Questions Nos. 9 and 10 that I asked, which relate to early childhood education.  The Minister is well aware I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland.  I do not speak in that capacity today but I must declare the interest.  I welcome the response on special needs but the reality, as the Minister is aware, is that a child will need additional and appropriate support and to say that it will be two days a week for one year and three days a week in the following year does not meet the needs of the child.  We must revisit the situation and examine the flexibility and how we are going to do it.<\/p><p>  I also inquired about the inspection regimes for child care settings, of which there are four, namely, the Child and Family Agency, the Department of Education and Skills, Pobal and also an environmental health inspection.  The difficulty is the lack of consistency.  The child care settings welcome an inspection regime but not four different inspection regimes.  One centre told me three inspectors arrived this week at the same time to spend an entire day there.  How is one supposed to cope with that?  Has a regulatory impact assessment been done to examine the inspection of child care settings and are we absolutely clear about what we expect?  I heard of two cases this week of centres that were fully compliant last year which were told they are not compliant because of Garda vetting.  If one has worked out of the State previously, vetting and checking from another state is required.  One woman who worked 25 years ago in the United States has been told her service is non-compliant because she does not have an FBI check for her time 25 years ago in the USA.  I would worry if I was a parent who heard a centre was non-compliant.<\/p><p>  My final point relates to the pressure on early childhood centres due to rates bills.  I will raise the matter in the Seanad with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.  In one case where 90% of the service involves State-provided services, the centre received a rates bill of &euro;13,000.  The State sets the amount of money one gets per child and the space one must have.  All the regulations are set by the State and one is not allowed to charge any extra money.  Although 90% of the set-up is regulated by the State and one is not allowed to charge any extra money, the centre could receive a bill for &euro;13,000.  I have heard similar stories around the country.  Many child care centres are close closing and I am fearful that will happen.  We must make it viable for centres to provide a quality, affordable service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300007#H00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1415875200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  I note that Deputy Troy has returned.  I will address the terms of reference, which a number of Deputies have raised.  The challenge for me and the Department is to set terms of reference that will establish a successful commission of inquiry.  We are guided in the first instance by the Oireachtas motion that was agreed earlier this year.  We know that at the heart of the desire to get to the truth is the suggestion that bodies of hundreds of children were buried in the mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.  There is a clear consensus around the need to thoroughly examine the manner in which Ireland treated many mothers who had babies in mother and baby homes.  We must give a clear, precise set of terms of reference to the commission to ensure that a wide range of factors relating to mother and baby homes is examined in great detail by the commission.  However, if we set the terms incorrectly, the result may be that the commission is robbed of an opportunity to do its work successfully in a timespan that is reasonable and in an efficient manner.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his understanding of the need for thoroughness at this stage.<\/p><p>  In the course of meeting with many groups about the establishment of the inquiry, I recognise that there are many issues arising that are wider than the issue of mother and baby homes, but none the less they are issues that people would be keen to include in the commission&rsquo;s work.  I find it difficult to disagree with their view that such issues need to be examined.<\/p> <p>If we set terms of reference that are too wide, the commission may be flawed from the start.<br\/>The task before me is to try to decide how best to achieve the goals set by the Oireachtas.  The commission into mother and baby homes cannot be viewed as a vehicle to inquire into all matters where there was a deficit in the treatment of people.  It must be set up to do an achievable task.  Should the Oireachtas decide other matters are worthy of separate examinations, such a decision can be reached.  The complexity of the issues involved and the need to meet the interested people and stakeholders has given cause to delay, although I do not like using that word, with regard to the expectation that we would have the terms of reference quicker.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that it is better that we do this right than do it quickly.  If we do not get it right, we could end up in a protracted tribunal that fails to address the issues the Oireachtas asked us to address.  I will not bore committee members with the motion but what the Oireachtas agreed is clear: &quot;to complete the process of identifying the relevant information and records, public and private, pertaining to mother and baby homes in the State in an urgent and timely manner.&quot;  We can broaden the definition of what constituted a mother and baby home where county homes or other facilities became the provider where there was no mother and baby home in that county.  The motion also states the Government should &quot;use the findings of the initial cross-departmental review which is already under way and is to report to the Government no later than 30 June 2014 [which it did] to inform decisions on the scope, format and terms of reference of a commission of investigation; and report back to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the establishment of this inquiry, the findings of which should in due course be published before the House rises for the summer recess.&quot;  We all accepted before the summer recess that this would require more time than originally envisaged.  Deputy Robert Troy asked if we would have it before Christmas.  It is my intention that we will have it in the next couple of weeks.  I want the work to get under way.<br\/>The guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>, GAL, issue has been consuming Tusla since its inception and is one that Mr. Gordon Jeyes has been strong on.  From previous contributions by me in a different ministerial post, the committee knows of my concern that huge sums of taxpayers' money that should be going to provide services and compensate people who were wronged are going to the legal profession.  I bear the legal profession no ill will but this is not what we wanted to happen.  We wanted a lean and cost-effective system that leaves the resources to those in need of our support.<br\/>The Deputy mentioned it is morally wrong that we have expensive GALs when many children in care have no dedicated social worker or a plan for after-care.  The Deputy also mentions the vetting of the GALs.  The GAL proposals are being finalised for my consideration and Tusla has made many changes to the structure in regard to the GAL issue.  I do not want to become confrontational with Deputy Robert Troy but we inherited it from his party's Government and it has existed for many years and was not addressed.  We are going to address this and I would be pleased to have the support of Deputy Robert Troy.  Deputy Troy suggests the budget increase is not good enough but that is being disingenuous coming from the party that wrecked the economy of the country and leaves us-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300007#H00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415875800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I was quoting Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the CEO charged with the responsibility-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300008#J00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1415875800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Any remarks must be made through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300008#J00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1415875800,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I did not interrupt Deputy Robert Troy.

That is what we intend to do but we must be realistic in the moneys available to us.  I welcome the increase in the budget after so many years of cuts.<br\/>Cyberbullying was mentioned and the Government is very much aware of it and concerned about it.  We have been engaged with the issue in a cross departmental fashion.  An Internet content governance advisory committee is developing an implementation plan.  My Department is involved in it.

My officials have offered to meet representatives from <i>ask.fm<\/i>to brief them on child protection issues.

In the past, we provided the early childhood supplement and the difficulty with that approach was that it did not necessarily go into the sector or provide for places.

She asked why there was a delay with the Children First legislation.  I have a note on the matter.  When the Bill was initiated the House brought forward a number of matters for consideration which have been the subject of a detailed review by my officials.  I hope to bring forward a small number of amendments arising out of same which are currently being finalised.  I hope that we will be able to move to Committee Stage very shortly because this is a very important Bill.  <\/p><p> Officials are also working on the Children's First guidance to reflect both the content of the Children First Bill along with the other child protection legislation.  For example, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  This matter has been raised by Deputies and I am committed to trying to advance it in tandem with the Bill.  I am not throwing the issue back at all but acknowledge the work done by this committee.  Some of the issues raised are very complex and we want to deal with them before we move forward but it is a priority for us.   <\/p><p> The Senator asked about how the committee will interact with the Child Family Agency.  The issue has been discussed a number of times within the Department.  We know that the HSE comes here and directly engages with the committee.  It is clear that the committee would like to interact with the agency.  The agency has only been set up so we need to allow it settle and get its feed under the table.  We also need to decide whether the agency should come here separately or come along with the Department and be here today as was often done with my other ministry.  The matter is still under discussion and I have heard the concerns expressed by members.  I want people to have access to the broadest amount of information.  Transparency serves us all very well.  Figures have been quoted and I think Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned that around 9,000 children still await the allocation of a dedicated social worker with a third of whom high priority.  I welcome that such information is in the public domain.  While I do not welcome the scenario, if the information is out there then at least we can try to deal with it in an open and transparent way, and not pretend things are other than what they are.  <\/p><p> The Senator asked about the delay in adoption legislation and what is happening with Senator Power's Bill.  My Department is examining it at the moment.  I got the Bill direct from the Senator and we also got a soft copy.  We are looking at the legislation but it is a very complicated area.  We have had the legal opinion of the Attorney General who is still studying it and has certain concerns.  Without going into specifics at this juncture, I do not believe in opposing a Bill just for the sake of it but how should we deal with it if it is flawed?  My Bill is nearly ready and it must take it into consideration.  We will continue to look at the legislation and I will revert to both Senator van Turnhout and Senator Power because I know they will support the legislation.  Without question we are all trying to achieve the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300008#J00800","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415876400,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Yes, without a doubt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300009#K00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1415876400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Everybody in this room will know that the T&aacute;naiste has a particular interest in this area as well for obvious reasons as does others like Deputy Anne Ferris.  I reiterate what I have said before.  I want to make the issue of people having access to information on their adoption and identity as easy as possible but within the law.  I want to put as much help around that as possible in order to get the outcome that we would all like to see.  However, I cannot ignore the right of a birth mother to privacy if she so demands.  In many instances that is not the case and instead it is a lack of information.  I take the opportunity to thank the Members for raising the matter again.  I want to highlight the fact that we now have an adoption agency that is only too willing and able to provide help.  People may not be aware that we live in different times.  People who were told they had no right to seek information should revisit the situation.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout acknowledged the fact that she is chair of Early Childhood Ireland which we welcome.  She asked us to look at the flexibility of the various programmes and whether a risk impact analysis had been carried out on the inspection regime.  I have a note on the matter.  The Department of Education and Skills is working closely with Pobal and Tusla to reduce the impact on services.  Both Pobal and Tusla have tried to minimise the impact of visits by setting out clearly what is required.  The impact of regulation will be kept under continuous review.  We would all agree here that we need regulation because that is where protection starts.

Focus Ireland has said that it is aware that between 25 and 30 young adults nationally are at risk of homelessness who are in hostel accommodation and have a care background.  It is also aware that there are between 450 and 500 children each year at risk.  This means between 2,500 and 3,000 young people have left care in the past six years.  A Bill will be introduced.  We are working on legislation to make sure that every child has an aftercare plan for when they leave care.  We have all heard of the tragic situations that occur when children leave care where, for all intents and purposes, they fall off a cliff.<\/p><p>  Before we break for a vote I want to say that there are no children under 18 years homeless on our streets.  They are either in care or an approved supported lodgings or residential accommodation.  <\/p><p>  I wish to say the following before everyone races to exercise their democratic right.

I thank him for his presentation.<\/p><p>  I shall commence by mentioning the terms of reference for mother and baby homes.  I strongly agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, that it is very important to get this right.  We have only one chance so we need to get it right.<\/p><p>  I shall now concentrate on the questions I submitted.  Question No. 6 asked about the working group for direct provision. <\/p> <p>In what capacity is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs represented on that working group?  While it is noted that the centre staff are Garda vetted, adults living in close proximity to children to whom they are not related are not Garda vetted.  This leaves children at risk.  It is not acceptable and more needs to be done to change this environment completely.<\/p><p> Even though children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and secondary schools, they are still stigmatised because of their living conditions.  They have no space to do their homework and they cannot carry on to third level education because they are not State-funded.  This matter also needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> Question No. 7 related to food poverty.  The charity, Healthy Food for All, called for a Department policy commitment to address food poverty and childhood obesity.  The Minister's reply stated that the Department is not responsible for financial assistance, but surely the Department should have a wide-ranging policy and approach across all the relevant Departments.<\/p><p> Question No. 8 related to the issue of homelessness among young people leaving care.  Senator van Turnhout also had a question on the matter.  The Minister stated that children between the ages of 16 and 17 are provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  What is the service and what would the Minister define as suitable accommodation?  He also stated that some of these children suffer from mental health or learning difficulties.  Are all their needs catered for?<\/p><p> The Minister stated that as of December 2013, 639 people over the age of 18 were supported financially through living with their foster parents.  For how long after the age of 18 does this financial support continue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300009#K01400","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415877000,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I will not refer to anything previous speakers have adequately dealt with.  Question No. 5 relates to the schools completion programme.  I want to protest over the fact that the cut went ahead.  Before criticising the Department, in the interest of balance I compliment the Department on the speed with which it responded to the difficulties the Respond! housing agency has with its women's refuge for mothers and children in Tallaght that has been operating for about three years.  While I know the Minister was not there, we got a very positive reply to the Topical Issue matter.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister is well aware of the value of the school completion programme.  Essentially it is trying to keep children who were born on the wrong side of the track in school.  A variety of activities and not just principally academic activities are included.  The overriding difficulty relates to children who, due to their background or circumstances, fall out of the educational system.  The school completion programme is a wonderful scheme that operates throughout the country.  I am very impressed by the commitment of school principals, teachers and others who work in the schools.  They have made it into something valuable for children, who for a variety of reasons may not wish to go to school.  Many of us fell into that category in the past.<\/p><p>  When the economy collapses, we all understand there is reduced funding for a variety of things.  Unfortunately, this programme was included and over recent years the cut has multiplied.  As the scheme is under severe pressure because of the reduction in the funding, I wrote to the Department in the hope that the cut would not proceed, but it has gone ahead.  I know a review is outstanding.<\/p><p>  My principal point is that while we talk about fairness in education and the school completion programme involves 36,000 children nationwide, the funding for this year has been reduced to approximately &euro;25 million.  The level of discrimination in education is exposed by the fact that on the other hand another Department pays out &euro;100 million to 26,000 children of the great and good who attend private schools.  For every &euro;1 we give to the poorest children in the country to try to get them to go to school, we give &euro;4 to the children of the better off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300010#L00200","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1415877000,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McLellan for her understanding of the terms of reference.  She mentioned people in direct provision who are in close contact with children and yet unvetted.  That is certainly an issue we will need to look into.  I have met the Minister for Justice and Equality to discuss the issue.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the involvement of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in proper nutrition.  Yesterday in Armagh along with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, I met the Deputy's party colleague in the North, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MLA, and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Jim Wells, MLA, to discuss this area.<\/p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has a unique position.  We operate in a very different way from most Departments.  We do not have a silo effect with specific areas of responsibility to the exclusion of everything else.  We operate with a core responsibility for certain matters, but we have impact on and co-operate with the Departments of Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, the Environment, Community and Local Government, and Health.  I would say ours is the only Department to have permanent civil servants from other Departments based in our Department.  We have people from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, and Education and Skills, who belong in other Departments but work in our Department to help co-ordinate and have a more coherent approach to the well-being of children.<\/p><p>  Nutrition is a major focus for us.  We have Healthy Ireland, which is a cross-departmental initiative to improve the health of the nation.  Our equivalent of that in a smaller way is Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  We look at all that.  We look at school nutrition.  We look at education and we look at enabling children to help them cook meals themselves, understand the value of food, reduce the reliance on ready-made food and become more self-reliant.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's issue is well raised and is one of serious concern, considering the level of obesity, particularly the level of obesity and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in teenagers, which is something I never saw when I was practising as a doctor ten or 15 years ago but now is not unusual.  There is no question; it is down to diet and lack of physical activity.<\/p><p>  I will ask Ms Clarke to respond to the Deputy's questions on direct provision as well as the question relating to the aftercare service and how long the financial support lasts after they leave.<\/p><p>  I come to Deputy Maloney's questions on the school completion programme cut.  I was not here yesterday because I was at a North-South Ministerial Council meeting, so my absence was unavoidable.<\/p> <p>I apologise for not being there myself, but I am very pleased that the answer Deputy Maloney was given shows that attention is being given to this area.  The cut was right across all services.  It was part of the comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE.  It was probably highlighted later than many of the other ones and therefore possibly stood out.  I could not agree with Deputy Maloney more.  The school completion programme is extremely important.  Everyone knows, and all the statistics show, that if one falls out of education early, one is more likely to end up in trouble, to have social problems and to do less well in life in terms of one's personal financial situation.  It is important we encourage people to stay in school and complete their education and it is very important when it comes to minority groups that we encourage them, too, to stay in college.  As the Deputy mentioned, the ESRI is doing a review and we look forward to the outcome of that.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to Ms Michele Clarke, who will address some of the questions raised by Deputy McLellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300010#L00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415877600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>The working group on direct provision met for the first time last Monday.  I am the representative from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We are a very large group and very busy.  Our chair, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, has set us quite a task to deliver across a range of issues.  The tranche I will most directly be involved with is the living conditions of people in direct provision, particularly, from the Department's perspective, in respect of children.  I think it was because I am the head of social work in the Department that I was asked to sit on that committee.  The expectation is that we would report by Easter, but as our chairperson has said, Easter is coming early this year and we want to do a proper job.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan had some questions in relation to the use of section 5.  There is nothing to preclude any child up to the age of 18 being taken into care, and that would be the preference of the agency.  From time to time, a 16 or 17 year old may object to coming into care and feel that this is not appropriate for them, and yet they have needs.  They need to be supported if they are not able to live at home.  Where they are placed in supported lodgings, these are approved placements with a responsible adult.  They are provided in domestic settings where the responsible adult looks after them.  This person has been checked from a medical point of view as well as undergoing Garda vetting and has been selected in particular for their suitability to work with teenagers, often teenagers who may not agree that they need to be cared for.  An allowance is paid.  The numbers are very small.  I do not have them to hand, but I can get them for the Deputy if she wishes.  The agency prefers to have a child fully in care where that is possible.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also had a question on aftercare and young adults who remain living with their foster carers.  The allowance can be paid at the moment until they are 23 if they are in full-time education, or up to 21 for those not in full-time education.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a working group which is looking at standardising the payment for aftercare in foster care.  At the moment it can be anything up to &euro;365 a week.  We have more than 500 young people in aftercare who are in third level education, and issues arise as to what proportion of the allowance should go to the young person and what proportion should stay with the foster carer, since the young person will return home, as college students do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014111300011#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1415877600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its questions and its courtesy and I look forward to working with it for the remainder of the Administration.

We are all focused on the one outcome here and while we might differ occasionally on certain points, I believe that good wishes and good intentions in relation to children are universal.  One thing that has struck me since becoming Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is the enormous amount of volunteerism right across this sector.
