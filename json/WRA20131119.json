Over recent weeks, I met with all of the party leaders in the Executive and with the British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg MP as well as with the Independent Chair of the Panel of Parties, Dr. Richard Haass, to discuss ways forward.  I have also visited the interface areas in Ardoyne, Carrick Hill and Short Strand and was briefed by the Apprentice Boys and the PSNI in Derry about their assessment of the situation.  As the Deputy will know from his recent visit to Belfast, the threats posed by dissident groups are undoubtedly serious.  Since 2009, a series of violent attacks by these dissident groups have taken place, resulting in injuries and in the deaths of two British Army personnel, two PSNI officers and a member of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, David Black, in a brutal attack just a year ago.  I know that all members of this House unreservedly condemn these acts and support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in their efforts to overcome the dissident threat.  <\/p><p>  Over the last year there have been serious public order disturbances in Belfast.  Some reputational damage was certainly caused by extensive international media coverage of the violence in Belfast following the 12th of July parades and the so called anti-internment march organised by dissidents in August.  I condemn all such violence and the disregard for the rule of law which has been shown.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has our highest admiration for the professionalism they have shown in the face of provocation from dissident loyalism and dissident republicanism marching on the street of Belfast over the summer. <\/p><p>  The Parades Commission has worked hard to find solutions to contentious parades and their legally binding decisions should command respect from the political leadership of Northern Ireland as well as in the community.  Anything less than wholehearted support for the rule of law and for the Police Service of Northern Ireland damages peace and stability and is a matter of the most serious concern to the Irish government. <\/p><p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments urge the political parties in Northern Ireland to grasp the opportunity offered by the Haas talks.  Political leadership is essential if we are to prevent further damage to community relations and to build support for the rule of law, the PSNI and to secure stability and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900053#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 88 and 89 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Service Issues","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900053#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[48805\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900053#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department will consider establishing a passport office service in the north west, in view of the distance of that region from Dublin.

This means that no Irish citizen in the State, including in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency has any significant distance to travel.  Furthermore, as I have informed the House on a number of previous occasions an appointment service has been in operation at the Molesworth Street Passport Office for almost a year.  The service allows customers to book a guaranteed time slot between 9:00 and 17:00, Monday to Friday.  The service removes the necessity for any citizen to queue and provides certainty as to the duration of time customers will wait to be seen at the public counter.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the Passport Express services, customers are given a commitment by the Passport Service that ten days from the date of receipt by the Passport Service of properly completed applications a passport will be issued.

Official estimates indicate that at least 3,600 lives have been lost.  However, it is likely that the full picture of the human cost of this disaster will only emerge in the coming days as relief teams get to remote areas, which are without power and communication following one of the most powerful storms ever recorded.<\/p><p>  For our part, Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this disaster and, on the basis of pledges announced to date, our contribution currently stands as one of the highest amounts provided by a bilateral donor.  On Sunday, 10 November, the Government announced emergency funding from Ireland of &euro;1 million towards the relief effort for Typhoon Haiyan.  One week later, as the magnitude of this disaster became apparent, this sum was increased to &euro;2.25 million.  A separate dispatch of over 100 tonnes of essential shelter items for distribution to families worst affected by the disaster, to the value of &euro;510,000, was also authorised and arrived in Cebu on Wednesday, 13 November.  Irish Aid is preparing for a further airlift of essential shelter items in the coming days.<\/p><p>  My officials are in daily contact with UNOCHA, UNICEF and WFP on requirements for deployment of technical experts from the Irish Rapid Response Corps.  An Irish Captain and engineer in the Defence Forces was deployed on 17<sup>th<\/sup> November to support WFP&rsquo;s operations in the Philippines and an Information Management Specialist was deployed on the same day to support UNICEF&rsquo;s operations.  We expect further deployments in the coming days.  In addition, we have authorised the release of &euro;425,000 in funding which had been pre-positioned with trusted NGO partners for sudden-onset emergencies such as this.  This brings the total sum of Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to date to over &euro;3 million.<\/p><p>  My officials are also in regular contact with the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) and, in particular, the EU Emergency Response Centre. The EU has made available &euro;10 million in emergency funding to support the immediate relief efforts in the areas worst affected by the Typhoon and has pledged a further US$40 million in longer-term development assistance to assist with the Philippines' efforts to recover from this devastating disaster.<\/p><p>  Despite the many logistical challenges to the relief effort, the response of the international community has been rapid, with a large UN Disaster Coordination (UNDAC) team and a team of experts from ECHO being deployed to assist the national authorities to assess the impact of the disaster as early as Friday, 8 November. <\/p><p>  On the basis of these co-ordinated assessments, a UN Flash Appeal was jointly launched by the UN and the Government of the Philippines on Tuesday, 12 November. This appeal calls for funding of just over US $300 million to cover immediate emergency relief, and continued support to the affected populations over the coming six months. To date, US$ 78 million, 26 % of the funds requested under this appeal, has been received.  Ireland will examine the potential for further contributions, within our means, to the relief programmes identified within this appeal.<\/p><p>  The international community has learned many lessons from previous crises, such as the 2004 Tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), reform of the humanitarian system has led to clear plans being put in place to strengthen preparedness and ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.

Free trade agreements such as these are important in helping our ambitious and innovative exporters to build new markets.  The trade agreement with Colombia and Peru can also contribute in a significant way to economic developments in those countries.  Leveraging the most from this potential can best be done by supporting economic growth that is made sustainable through good governance in the form of respect for labour as well as environmental standards, and the full promotion and protection of human rights.

I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.        <\/p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.    <\/p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system.

It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.   The focus has since shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues and a key factor here remains convincing the Republican House Majority of the importance of making progress.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress has been preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my most recent contacts and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.  I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.

The allegations of collusion and the murders described in Anne Cadwallader&rsquo;s book Lethal Allies, and the BBC and RT&Eacute; documentary on &quot;The Disappeared&quot; this week, remind us that dealing with the past remains a central issue for society.  They also remind us that thousands of people lost their lives, tens of thousands of people were injured and very few communities are untouched by the violence, trauma and bitter legacy of the period.<\/p><p>  Allegations of collusion, investigations and calls for public inquires into such allegations have featured in our discussions with the British authorities since the 1970s. Most recently, following the report by Sir Desmond Da Silva into Pat Finucane's murder, the British Prime Minister David Cameron said the degree of collusion exposed between elements of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries was &quot;unacceptable&quot;.<\/p><p>  Anne Cadwallader personally briefed my officials on the main conclusions of her book shortly in advance of publication.  On 9 November in Armagh, I had the opportunity to meet with Denise Fox.  She is the daughter of Denis Mullen, an SDLP Councillor who was murdered at his home near Moy on September 1, 1975.  I was moved to hear firsthand about the impact her father's murder, and the attempted murder of her mother, has had on her life.  Like many families in NI her search for truth is not yet complete.  Many murders in that area highlighted by Ms. Cadwallader were raised by the Irish Government with British counterparts over the years, following representations from politicians and clergy in the area about the conduct of the security forces and UDR personnel.  We are now examining the new text in detail and will consider further action in light of that examination.  I raised these issues when I met the British Deputy Prime Minster, Nick Clegg, in London last week.<\/p><p>  The Government supports the work of the Panel of Parties established by the First Minister and deputy First Minister to look at dealing with the past, with parades and with flags and emblems.

There       is much in the Eames Bradley Report that is of relevance.

The programme reflects the values and generosity of spirit of the Irish people and is a concrete expression of our determination to help those less fortunate than ourselves.  Our new policy on international development - <i>One World, One Future<\/i>  - maintains the Government's focus on assisting some of the world's poorest countries and communities, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa.  It also  takes account of Ireland's future economic and trading interests, as developing countries grow their economies and generate their own revenues, while we continue to enhance our ties with them.  It also reconfirms the Government's commitment to achieving the UN target of contributing 0.7% of GNP in Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.<\/p><p>  Over the past few years, despite the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country and the unprecedented demands on the exchequer, this Government has managed to largely stabilise our ODA budget.  In all the circumstances, this is a very significant achievement and a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to the programme.  Ireland's total ODA budget for next year is expected to be set at some &euro;602 million, compared with &euro;622 million in 2013.  This is slightly less than 50 cent in every &euro;100 of our national income.  <\/p><p>  The most recent data published by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) relates to 2012 and confirms that the ODA budgets of many donor countries, including Ireland, have been reduced as a result of the financial crisis.

","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>The protracted and tragic crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries has resulted in unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, requiring a sustained and urgent response from the international community.  As the number of fatalities moves towards 120,000, there are now approximately 9 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support.  In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.2 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries.  Ireland has been doing all it can to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, having provided almost &euro;14 million in assistance since the crisis began.  Ireland has focused our humanitarian aid through trusted NGO partners, as well as to key UN partners and the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement - agencies capable of delivering impartial assistance to large numbers of beneficiaries.  These agencies also play a key role in supporting the host governments in neighbouring countries to provide assistance to the refugee populations.  This funding has supported the provision of water, food, shelter and vital medicines to internally displaced persons within Syria and also to refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon.  We have worked closely with all agencies that receive Irish Aid support to ensure that the necessary systems are in place to monitor and evaluate the use and impact of Ireland's assistance, and to ensure aid is delivered in accordance with the fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. <\/p><p>  Recently confirmed cases of polio in the highly-contested north-east Deir-ez-Zor province of Syria are an extremely worrying development.  These cases mark the first polio outbreak in Syria in 14 years.  Our partners UNICEF and the World Health Organization have mobilized a campaign to contain the confirmed polio outbreak and have launched a national immunization strategy, targeting 1.6 million children.  In light of the particularly worrying conditions for Syrian children, Ireland has to date provided &euro;1 million to support UNICEF's efforts to enhance access to essential health services for children and we have provided an additional &euro;300,000 to the World Health Organization in direct response to the crisis. <\/p><p>  In order to assess the situation on the ground, I travelled to the region in early October.  While there, I witnessed the deteriorating humanitarian situation and emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s support for the generous efforts of Syria's neighbouring countries to provide shelter and basic services for Syrian refugees.  During my visit, I announced an additional contribution of 3 million Euros for operations in Syria and neighbouring countries, thereby demonstrating Ireland's continued leadership and commitment to respond to one of the most complex humanitarian contexts in the world today.<\/p><p>  Ireland has matched its material humanitarian support with concrete efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.  We have consistently called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves, to the humanitarian response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":76,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 89.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[48872\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any discussion with the Spanish authorities in relation to human rights issues of Basque prisoners, especially in relation to alleged torture and in relation to those prisoners who are extremely ill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The inclusion of Regional Roundtables and networking opportunities for SMEs, both north and south, will also hopefully produce tangible outcomes for Irish businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Question No. 118 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Enterprise Initiatives","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03325"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[44111\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on an all-island economy.

The Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy, launched in October 2006, set out an ambitious range of strategies and collaborative actions aimed at maximising the competitive advantages of the island.  Through constructive engagement with Northern Ireland Ministers, we continue to build on the findings of that study, to develop initiatives designed to boost economic activity on the island and to eliminate market distortions arising from the existence of the border.  We are far better off working together than separately, and the development of an all-island economy is in everyone's interests.Promoting an all-island identity has already proved very successful in the Tourism sector, where Tourism Ireland has successfully marketed the island throughout the world.<\/p><p>  Progress on an all-island basis also continues to be made in the area of Innovation which is now a major priority both North and South with hundreds of research scientific projects underway involving partners from universities and institutes of technology.  As we focus on promoting jobs and growth, it is also important that we maximise co-operation and participation in current and forthcoming EU Framework programmes for research and technological development.  InterTrade Ireland, in addition to encouraging small and medium enterprises to maximise commercial opportunities across the island, has developed programmes specifically to help SMEs develop their innovative and exporting capabilities, and to encourage and stimulate greater co-operation and increased applications for Framework Programmes funding.<\/p><p>  I am convinced that with the agencies, North and South, cooperating in marketing our innovative island and on investment promotion and overseas trade missions, this will be the engine that ensures there will be a bright economic future for this island.<\/p><p>  I believe that the potential for intra-island trade and economic activity has not yet been fully tapped and that there is scope for increasing the levels of trade in both directions.  In support of this we clearly need to assist our SMEs in whatever ways we can.  This in turn can safeguard jobs, and encourage cross-border investments. InterTrade Ireland is already doing excellent work in this area.<\/p><p>  The opportunities to work together in developing trade links with the key emerging markets on an all-island basis are clear.  Our Embassies continue to be available to assist trade missions from both parts of the island and individual companies from either North or South or on an all-island basis to take advantage of opportunities for mutual cooperation. <\/p><p>  Discussions on financial and economic matters feature at all Plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).   At the recent NSMC plenary meeting in Armagh on 8 November 2013 discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the actions being undertaken to help support economic recovery, the importance of attracting Foreign Direct Investment and ensuring adequate access to credit within the banking sector in each jurisdiction.     <\/p><p>  In the context of the St Andrews Agreement Review, Ministers are considering their priorities for further co-operation in their respective sectoral areas.     <\/p><p>  We will continue to work closely and constructively with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive to examine how we can jointly support economic growth and the creation of jobs on the island and will continue to look at areas where we can expand mutually beneficial cooperation, find economies of scale and seek to eliminate unnecessary duplication in the provision of services.<\/p><p>  In particular, there is a pressing need to create jobs, especially for our young people.  Youth unemployment is an urgent priority across this island, and Ministers have agreed that, where possible, we should work together to make the most of the common approaches being taken North and South to deal with this key issue. <\/p><p>  The recent Global Irish Economic Forum focused on opportunities for job creation, especially for the young, and on economic growth.  I was clear that this year's Forum should provide an opportunity to plan and to strategise on an all-island basis.  That is why I asked that one of the three regional events take place in Belfast.  Very significantly representatives of Northern companies and business groups also attended roundtable discussions with Network members as part of the main Forum event at Dublin Castle.  The indications are that genuine contacts were established with real prospects for assisting the export growth of businesses with all-island business interests.  It is clear that the Northern business community have recognised how much the economy, North and South, can gain from such co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[44110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900054#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions held with First Minister Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness in respect of the programme of work being conducted in Northern Ireland by Dr Richard Haass.

When considering any particular deployment, a number of factors are taken into account, including the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate which has the potential to contribute to a political solution; consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy; and the degree of risk involved.  My Department works closely with the Department of Defence in advising on the foreign policy considerations to be taken into account in the decision to deploy. <\/p><p>  EUTM is playing a very important role in strengthening the capacity of the Somali army, with a view to the long-term sustainable development of the country&rsquo;s security forces.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EUTM Somalia, which has been led by an Irish Force Commander since 2011, has formed an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to efforts to support peace and stability in the country.  There are currently eight members of the Defence Forces serving with EUTM Somalia, and my Department has seconded a civilian Political Advisor to the mission since September 2013.<\/p><p>  Following a change in the mandate of the mission in January 2013, EUTM Somalia is gradually moving its activities from Uganda to Mogadishu. It has also refocused its activities towards strategic-level mentoring and advice to the Somali Ministry of Defence and General Staff, along with support and advice on Security Sector Development. Subject to security conditions in Mogadishu, the move is expected to be completed in January. Participation in EUTM Somalia is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis. Government approval is required for the continued participation of the Defence Forces in the mission beyond 31 December 2013. Proposals in this regard will be brought to Government by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the coming weeks.

The proposed programme of Ministerial travel is drawn up by my Department in consultation with the Embassy network and the state agencies and then considered by Government on my recommendation.

My visit to China in July of this year, organised by my Department and the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, in close cooperation with the state agencies, had a strong trade and investment focus including targeted meetings with Chinese companies interested in investing in Ireland and potential partners for Irish exporters, several business networking and investment events, a promotional event with Tourism Ireland and the announcement of the achievement of full market access for Irish salmon to the Chinese market.   <\/p><p>  Last week, I met with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in London on a visit which focused on opportunities for Irish financial services companies. During the visit, I hosted an Enterprise Ireland event for senior executives from thirty Irish technology and financial services companies and their key UK-based clients from the banking, insurance and retail sectors. Organised in close cooperation between the Embassy of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, the annual event is designed to support Irish software and financial services companies to increase exports to the UK and create jobs in Ireland. It is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s premier financial services sector event in London, where financial services is a key target sector.<\/p><p>  Since 2011, I have led several trade-focused visits to the US and the UK as well as individual visits, focusing on trade and economic promotion to China, Canada, France, Germany, Russia, Japan, Korea, Uganda and Kenya. The then Minister of State for Trade and Development Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan led a trade-focused visit to Vietnam in 2011 and her successor, Minister of State Joe Costello has led trade-focused visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria and also accompanied the President on his recent visit to Mexico and last year&rsquo;s visit to South America (Brazil, Argentina and Chile), both of which included a substantial trade focus.<\/p><p>  In addition to the visits outlined above, I agree the programme of Enterprise Ireland trade missions each year with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation based on the proposals submitted by Enterprise Ireland and focused on the priority markets of interest to their client companies. Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led overseas trade missions and events, organised with the active support of my Department&rsquo;s Embassy network, are an important element of the Government Trade Strategy, which recognises the valuable role they play in developing and creating new trade, tourism and investment opportunities for Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Ten Enterprise Ireland trade missions have been led by myself and Ministers of State from my Department since the formation of the Government. In 2011, then Minister of State for Trade and Development, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan TD led Enterprise Ireland trade missions to Saudi Arabia\/Qatar and to South Africa. In 2012, Minister of State Joe Costello led Enterprise Ireland trade missions to Turkey, Russia, Brazil and South Africa. This year, I led an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Turkey and Minister of State Costello has led Enterprise Ireland trade missions to Canada, Belgium and South Africa\/Nigeria. Enterprise Ireland does not release the names of companies that accompany Ministers on trade missions as this is commercially sensitive information. The travel and accommodation costs for the travelling Minister and two officials are borne by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>  The benefits flowing from such trade missions are realised over time making it difficult to measure accurately the jobs or total exports secured as a result of a specific trade mission. However, Enterprise Ireland provides information on contracts won during trade missions as appropriate. These contracts won and the contacts made during trade missions lead to job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland. In 2012, indigenous exports reached a new record level of &euro;16.2 billion and net job creation from inward investment was at its highest in ten years.

The EU, and Ireland as a bilateral donor,   also provide very significant humanitarian support across Africa, in close cooperation with regional bodies, including the African Union. <\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made on regional security with the support of EU Common Security and Defence Policy missions. Somalia is a good example of the EU&rsquo;s Comprehensive Approach in action, with the Horn of Africa Strategy acting within the wider framework for EU action in Africa.

Another element is the EU&rsquo;s Military Training Mission which has been training Somali soldiers since 2010, and which is currently led by an Irish Mission Commander, Brigadier General Gerald Aherne. Last year a civilian maritime capacity building mission, EUCAP NESTOR, was launched, which is mandated to enhance the capacities of five countries in the Horn of Africa to tackle maritime security issues, including piracy.

In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.2 million Syrians who have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries. Ireland has been doing all it can to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, having provided almost &euro;14 million in assistance since the crisis began.

Following the agreement reached in June under the Irish Presidency, a new chapter in Turkey&rsquo;s accession negotiations was formally opened for the first time in three years at an Inter-Governmental Conference which took place earlier this month.

Ireland is working closely with our EU partners and others to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issues of human rights and humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region.  The latest outbreak of violence in Sudan, including the attacks on UNAMID peacekeepers on 13 October near El Geneina, in West Darfur, in which one Zambian and three Senegalese peacekeepers were killed and one more wounded, were strongly condemned by the EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, and by UN Secretary General Ban and members of the UN Security Council.  I am pleased to note that the mandate of the joint African Union - UN lead mission, which is over 20,000-strong and contributes greatly to peace and security in the region, has recently been extended until August 2014.<\/p><p>  In January last, with Ireland&rsquo;s encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians and has underlined the fact that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to progress in providing the full range of support that we would like to provide to Sudan, and in the greater region.  The UN Security Council on 2 May and 17 May adopted Resolutions demanding that both Sudan and South Sudan fulfil their obligations under international law to allow access by humanitarian agencies to civilian populations in need of assistance.<\/p><p>  In the period following the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolutions, there has reportedly been some calming of the tensions between Khartoum and Juba, and less violence on the ground.  However, the issue of humanitarian access has remained unclear, despite continuing pressure from the EU and other parties.<\/p><p>  On 27 June 2012, the Sudanese Government finally approved a Tripartite Proposal of the African Union, the Arab League and the United Nations for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in the areas of the Blue Nile and South Kordofan held by the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N). The deal further included a joint plan between the Sudanese Government and the UN to deliver humanitarian relief to those in need in both states.<\/p><p>Ireland also ensures that focused attention is given to the situation in both Sudan and South Sudan in the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member. At the 23rd session of the Human Rights Council in June 2013, Ireland, as Presidency of the Council of the European Union, delivered a statement on behalf of the European Union about the human rights situation in South Sudan.  In it, the European Union expressed concern at reports of increasing intimidation towards journalists and human rights defenders, as well as serious constraints on the rights to freedom of expression and of assembly.  The EU encouraged the Government of South Sudan to bring the legal framework regulating activities of civil society actors in line with international standards.  The statement also highlighted major concerns as to the justice and prison systems and encouraged the Government of South Sudan to ensure accountability for all perpetrators of human rights violations.<\/p><p>  At the 24th session of the UN Human Rights Council which took place in September 2013, the EU delivered a statement to the Council under Item 4 of the Council&rsquo;s agenda. Item 4 deals with human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention. This statement expressed concern as to the violent conflict in both Sudan and South Sudan, noting in particular ongoing human rights violations against civilians, perpetrated in impunity.<\/p><p>  As a member of the EU, Ireland aligned itself fully with this EU statement and also made a national statement under Item 4 which further emphasised our concerns as to the situation in Sudan.<\/p><p>  At the same session, Ireland also intervened in the interactive dialogue with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Sudan, focussing in particular on freedom of religion and the rights of women and children. Ireland urged the Government of Sudan to implement fully its constitutional provisions and international obligations relating to freedom of religion, ensuring respect for the religious belief of others. Ireland noted its disquiet at the security risks, including sexual and gender-based violence to which women are exposed and urged the Government of Sudan to accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently in contact with a range of interlocutors in Sudan, including our Irish NGO partners working in the area.  In terms of practical and financial support, the Government has provided substantial assistance for those affected by the conflict in this region.  At the start of this year, I approved an allocation of &euro;3 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds (CHFs) for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.  On 8 July, in recognition of deterioration in the humanitarian situation I announced a further funding allocation of &euro;2m to these CHFs.  These funds are being provided to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas affected by conflict and by displacement of populations from the Blue Nile and South Kordofan areas.  In addition, almost &euro;2.5 million in assistance has been allocated to a number of key Irish NGO partners, including Goal, Tr&oacute;caire, MSF and World Vision for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Irish Aid Humanitarian Programme Plan funding scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":175,"content":"<p>Question No. 151 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[49547\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the use of child soldiers throughout various conflict areas worldwide continues to be monitored by the international community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The involvement of child soldiers has been reported in most recent armed conflicts and in almost every region of the world over the last two decades. Each year, the United Nations Secretary-General issues a report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. The most recent list includes 52 state and non-state armed groups operating across three continents.  It is estimated that up to 300,000 children continue to be involved in more than 30 conflicts worldwide, including, notably, in a number of internal and regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa. Against this background, international legal efforts to curb the practice of using children in armed conflict have been stepped up significantly.  In 1996, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the post of Special-Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict<b>,<\/b>   tasked to serve as an independent advocate for the protection and well-being of boys and girls affected by armed conflict.<\/p><p>  In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context. With the adoption of nine Resolutions and several Presidential statements since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.<\/p><p>  The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000 and entered into force in 2002. It is considered the core international human rights treaty on child soldiers: It lays out clear standards relating to the recruitment and use of under-18s by state armed forces as well as non-state armed groups which, if fully implemented, provide a strong foundation for long-term prevention of unlawful recruitment and use of children, and for assisting those who have already became involved in armed conflict.<\/p><p>  Ireland has engaged on this issue in various ways including, crucially, through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development &ndash; major root causes of this problem. Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific interventions from supporting agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, to designing interventions in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict. We remain deeply committed to addressing this issue, as has been recently reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;, where we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also been active on the question of child soldiers during our membership of the Human Rights Council.  Ireland intervened in the interactive dialogue with the Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. Leila Zerrougui, which took place during the 24<sup>th<\/sup> session of the Human Rights Council in September 2013.  In our intervention, we expressed strong support for the mandate of the SRSG and underlined that the conviction of Thomas Lubanga last year for the recruitment and use of child soldiers sent a powerful message that no individual who violates international criminal law can be confident of impunity.  We encouraged all concerned countries to cooperate with UN mechanisms and to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Child on armed conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[49548\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he continues to use his influence at EU and UN level with a view to ensuring that women and girls under various regimes worldwide not known for their observance of women&rsquo;s human rights are encouraged to address these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>The Government remains fully committed to combating all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls.

As the Deputy will recall, I raised the matter with Ukraine&rsquo;s Foreign Minister during our bilateral meeting on 27 September on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.  The issue was also raised at an informal ministerial level breakfast meeting between members of the Council and Ukraine which I attended before the FAC last month.The European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine, which is led by the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, has also been engaging actively with the Ukrainian authorities to resolve all areas where the EU has expressed concern, including the area of selective justice. The mission has met with Ms Tymoshenko in hospital in Kharkiv more than a dozen times over the past 17 months.  I wish to commend the mission for the conscientious and professional manner in which it has performed its important task and to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s full support for its work.  On 4 October, the monitoring mission made a public appeal to the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, to release Ms Tymoshenko for medical treatment on health and humanitarian grounds by way of pardon. Germany has publicly stated that it would be ready to host Ms Tymoshenko for such treatment.  I support their appeal. However, President Yanukovych has indicated a preference for the alternative path of a special law, to be agreed in the Ukrainian parliament, which would permit treatment abroad of convicted persons on health and humanitarian grounds, including Ms Tymoshenko.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, and as the monitoring mission reported to the European Parliament&rsquo;s Conference of Presidents on 13 November, the Ukrainian parliament has been unable to reach agreement to date on a draft law or formula that would permit Ms Tymoshenko to leave Ukraine for medical treatment.

The new credit will be targeted such that it is available only to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer\/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.

The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.<\/p><p>  I should point out that, there is no specific tax credit for children in the Irish tax code; rather credits are applicable in respect of children in different circumstances and therefore the decision to replace the One-Parent Family tax Credit with the new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit  does not undermine the equal rights of children or discriminate against children living in separate units.

Should it transpire that the person did in fact overpay the 2013 liability then it will be possible to offset some or all of the overpayment to the 2014 liability, or to make a repayment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Eligibility","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[48824\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900056#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider allowing apprentices to apply for tax relief on tuition fees as a result of the changes in the funding requirements being faced by apprentices during their time in institutes of technology.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides, subject to certain conditions, for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) as regards a portion of qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third-level education course including a postgraduate course.  Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &ldquo;student contribution&rdquo;. No other fees (e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees) qualify for tax relief. For the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years, the maximum qualifying fee per course per academic year is &euro;7,000.<\/p><p>  The tax relief is confined to tuition fees actually borne by the claimant.

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making payments to Institutes of Technology and apprentices will pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.<\/p><p>  The amount due by apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology during the academic year. This is typically one third of the Annual Student Contribution paid by students attending for the full academic year but it can be greater for certain trades where longer periods are spent in Institutes of Technology.<\/p><p>  From January 2014 up to the end of the academic year in June, apprentices will be due to pay &euro;833 (1\/3 of &euro;2,500) per typical attendance block. From September 2013, they are already paying &euro;233 (28% of &euro;833) in respect of the exam fee element of the ASC. Following the Budget, from January 2014 they will also be required to pay the balance which amounts to &euro;600 for the academic year 2013\/2014.

It was originally intended that this exemption would only apply to first-time buyers, which is clear from the heading to the section: &quot;Exemption for first-time buyers&quot;.  The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill (prior to enactment) also states that the exemption applies to first-time buyers.  The Deputy may recall that mortgage interest relief was phased out on mortgages taken out after 31 December 2012 and this measure was a transitional provision to help first-time buyers in the first year after the abolition of mortgage interest relief.  However, as written, the exemption benefits any buyer, not just a first-time buyer.  The result is that a person who purchases a second hand house and occupies it as a sole or main residence is entitled to the exemption regardless of whether s\/he is a first-time buyer.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that this exemption applies to a clearly defined group of property owners, who are being identified using Stamp Duty records.  These fall into two broad groups; those who purchased a residential property between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2013 and paid the LPT for 2013, and those who purchased a property after 1 May 2013.<\/p><p>  There is a significant amount of work involved in identifying individuals who bought in 2013 and who are entitled to the exemption.

In relation to the total amount of tax that will be refunded to these individuals, the Commissioners have advised that this figure will only be available when they are satisfied that they have identified all individuals who have paid LPT but are entitled to the exemption.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that information on this matter was first published on the Revenue website in July 2013.  Since then further information was updated on the Revenue website on 8 November 2013 confirming that the exemption in question was not restricted to first-time buyers who are owner occupiers, and that any person purchasing a property in 2013 will qualify for this exemption <i>once<\/i> they occupy the property as their sole or main residence.<\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue recently issued clarification on this matter to the media, which was extensively reported.

However, the VAT Directive does not allow goods and services to apply at the zero rate which were not in place at that rate on 1 January 1991.

This sub group provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.<\/p><p>  I understand from the Central Bank that there is significant support available to Irish businesses to help them make the transition to SEPA.

The &lsquo;readyforsepa.ie&rsquo; website provides general SEPA-related information and in addition, all of the banks have dedicated SEPA pages on their own websites.   SEPA migration teams are available to help businesses deal with the necessary changes and many of the banks also have educational videos and webcasts supporting the migration effort.

During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme. The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation. Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation. <\/p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government&rsquo;s biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900057#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Tax Strategy","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900057#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[45860\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900057#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the Government's international tax strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>As I have outlined in the document &quot;Ireland's International Tax Strategy&quot;, published on Budget day, the key word in relation to Ireland's international tax strategy is &quot;openness&quot;.

One of the most critical elements of the Budget process is the accuracy of systems for forecasting potential revenue yield in the year in question prior to the Budget actually taking place.<\/p><p>  In the context of a December Budget Day, the availability prior to the Budget of information on cumulative tax yields to the end of November gave a high degree of certainty to the estimation of potential outturn for the year.

This was complemented, at that time, by the introduction of an additional 5% USC charge in the form of a property relief surcharge on the use of property reliefs by certain higher earning individuals. The broad intention of these two measures was to reduce the legacy of property reliefs in line with Government policy to develop a fairer tax code. Although almost all of these property and area-based incentive reliefs have been brought to an end by this stage, unused reliefs were being be carried forward year after year into the future at substantial cost to the Exchequer.   The changes which I introduced were informed by an Economic Impact Assessment into this area which was conducted by my Department and the changes received broad cross party support at the time. The details of the measure curtailing property-based accelerated capital allowances are as follows:<\/p><p>- It only applies to the various accelerated property and area-based capital allowances schemes. The ordinary industrial buildings allowance or the wear and tear allowance for plant and machinery are unaffected. <\/p><p>- The measure applies potentially to any industrial building for which accelerated capital allowances have been claimed. It is not restricted to hotels.<\/p><p>- Importantly, it applies only to passive investors in these schemes or to those who are deemed in law not to be actively engaged in the trade. Persons who are actively engaged in their respective trades are not affected by this measure.<\/p><p>- With effect from January 2015, any unused capital allowances which are carried forward beyond the tax life of the building will be lost. This essentially means that if the tax life has ended anytime up to the end of 2014, then the unused allowances are lost in 2015. If, on the other hand, the tax life of a building ends in 2016 or 2017 or later, then it is at the end of that year that the unused allowances are lost. <\/p><p>  My intention back in December 2011, when I announced 2015 as the operative date for this measure, was to give adequate notice to those who may potentially be affected to take steps to ensure that the impact on them is minimised. The practical impact of this measure will only begin to be felt in a little over a year&rsquo;s time, at the earliest. I have no immediate plans at this time to review the policy before it has even come into effect and as far as I am concerned, the measure is proportionate and will be effective in bringing to an end the legacy of these property reliefs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900058#WRFF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Smuggling","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900058#WRFF03150"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[49383\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900058#WRFF03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review existing patrols at ports, land and sea, in the west of Ireland regarding sniffer dog, cover for operation and practice in relation to checks and monitoring for drugs; and the changes that are proposed to strengthen the cover in these locations.","asker":"1085","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they attach a very high priority to combating the smuggling of controlled drugs and are committed to playing an active role, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in working against this criminal activity and those responsible for it.

Position limits can be applicable to individual transactions or positions built up over time.    <\/p><p>  Ireland supports the imposition of a position limits regime through MiFID which will support market stability and help prevent market abuse. The position limits regime is set to apply to each class of commodity derivative. It will be supplemented by much greater transparency requirements, a position management regime and product intervention powers for the national competent authorities. We also support these important provisions. <\/p><p>  In relation to the decision maker on the application of position limits, Ireland supports a decision making process which provides an important role for all relevant actors, including trading venues, national competent authorities (NCAs) and the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA). It is important that trading venues co-operate fully with the NCAs and it is important that the NCAs bring to bear their knowledge and experience at ESMA level. ESMA should lead in relation to bringing a strong level of coherence and consistency into the decision making on position limits through setting the parameters in which decisions on position limits are made by the NCAs. <\/p><p>  Of course the MiFID negotiations between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission are still ongoing, with the Council agreement secured via a qualified majority (QMV) of member states. One possible compromise outcome is an enhanced role for ESMA, empowering it to provide an opinion where it considers an NCA to have made a decision inconsistent with the criteria it has set, and this could be supplemented by an added obligation on NCAs to explain the reasoning for its decision on its website in such instances. However, solutions are still under consideration by the co-legislators.            <\/p><p>  In relation to the detailed rules to be applied with respect to a position limits regime, it is likely that much of this will be left to level 2 legislation, which can provide for a more coherent and calibrated regime, determined at an EU level by ESMA.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the scope of EU financial services legislation on commodity and related derivative markets, it should be noted that the MiFID file, along with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) agreement secured under the Irish Presidency, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), provide for a much stronger legislative framework for dealing with speculation in commodity derivative markets deemed to be harmful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900058#WRFF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Eligibility","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[49489\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional number of health insurance policyholders who would have been unaffected by the tax relief changes announced in budget 2014 who will no longer qualify for this relief following the changes to risk equalisation credits and stamp duty levies announced on 12 November 2013; his estimate of the total number of policyholders who will now be impacted by the change in tax relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Stamp Duty is part of the permanent scheme of risk equalisation, which commenced in 2012 and followed the previous interim scheme of risk equalisation introduced by the previous Government.  Both schemes give effect to the policy of community rating of health insurance, which was a policy common to both this and the previous Government.<\/p><p>  The increased Stamp Duty rates, if agreed by the Oireachtas, will apply from 1 March 2014.  The Stamp Duty is charged on the health insurance company rather than the individual policy holder.  It does not automatically follow that any or all of the increased Stamp Duty charge will be passed onto the policy holder, although there is nothing to prevent the company doing so.  The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health, has called on insurance companies not to pass on all the cost of the increased Stamp Duty.  Also, the Stamp Duty has not increased on &ldquo;non-advanced cover&rdquo; policies, broadly speaking, those policies which provide cover for public hospitals only.<\/p><p>  A variety of factors will influence the insurance companies pricing strategy for health insurance policies, not only the income tax relief changes announced in the Budget and the Stamp Duty changes announced by the Minister for Health.  The tax changes may not be the most significant factor affecting the price of health insurance policies.  It is therefore not possible to estimate how, whether and to what extent the tax changes will impact on individual policies. <\/p><p>  I would like to point out to the Deputy that there is no question of any policy holder no longer qualifying for tax relief on the premium.

Sales of solid fuel, including coal, peat and chopped wood offered for sale as a fuel, are subject to VAT at a rate of 13&frac12; %. Any person whose sales in a 12 month period exceed or are likely to exceed &euro;75,000 is required to register for VAT.  In addition, since 1st May 2013, solid fuel carbon tax (SFCT) is chargeable on coal and peat, including sod peat, when these products are first supplied in the State. Any person making such a supply is required to register with Revenue.    <\/p><p>  Both VAT and SFCT on solid fuels are collected on a self-assessed basis and are subject to the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes applied by Revenue. In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that tax due has not been paid,  Revenue investigates the suspect person&rsquo;s tax liabilities and enforces the collection of any unpaid tax, including income tax, SFCT and VAT, together with any interest or penalties due.  As part of its work in this area, Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) and has established regional sub-groups of the HEMG to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Suppliers who suspect or have evidence that illegal solid fuel is being sold in their area should report this to their Local Authority and to Revenue either directly or through their representative associations.  Any reports to Revenue are treated as confidential and are fully investigated.  There have been some reports recently concerning suspected untaxed  fuel supplies and these are being investigated.<\/p><p>  The application of the solid fuel carbon tax on coal is heavily dependant on the regulatory regime for coal put in place by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and enforced by Local Authorities.

Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels unlawfully are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing environmental regulations and preventing such supply. Revenue liaises with these bodies, as required, to ensure that lawful supplies of solid fuels are properly taxed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[49515\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the pension arrangements in place for retired senior executives of the former Anglo Irish Bank; the cost to the Exchequer to maintain payments to these persons; and the number of former senior executives who are currently in receipt of pensions as a result of them having been employed by Anglo Irish Bank.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>I advised that Pension Schemes that were available to staff at Anglo Irish Bank included defined benefit schemes (which closed to new membership in 1994) and a defined contribution scheme.

Section 119 of the Act sets out the dates for payment of the Local Property Tax and clarifies that while the LPT is due by reference to a liability date it is not payable until a later date.  For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November 2013 and the tax is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  <\/p><p>  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  Detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property, including this issue, was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and published earlier this year. The guidance is available on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i> .<\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I would expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  <\/p><p>  The liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled and has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation.  Having a liability date before the year commences is preferable from an administrative point of view as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax. In particular, the liable person can put the required arrangements in place to ensure that phased payments by way of direct debit or deduction at source from employment, occupational pension or from certain Government payments would commence from January 2014 and would spread payment of the full LPT liability evenly over the course of 2014. I do not intend to change the liability date as specified in the legislation.  Therefore, I have no plans to change the legislation in question.<\/p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s\/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s\/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; property &ndash; whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG02250"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[49522\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900059#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money collected by the Revenue Commissioners from taxi companies in VAT collected on hand held radios issued to drivers, on an annual basis for the past five years, and the number of companies involved.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/14 school year by 15th March, 2013.  The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/2014 school year in June of this year.  The NCSE has also now published details of the additional SNA allocations which have been made to schools since the initial allocations were made to schools in June. The NCSE published details of these revised allocations on 21st October, 2013.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.<\/p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy currently has 4 approved SNA posts.  It is important to note that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal\/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.<\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900060#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Uniforms","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900060#WRH02850"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[49273\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900060#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if all schools in Fingal will be included in the parents questionnaire on school uniforms; if not, the schools that will receive the questionnaire; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This scheme will apply to all new Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers, as defined in the Act.<\/p><p>  As regards reductions to pensions, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 provided for an average Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) from 1 January 2011 of about 4% for those who retired prior to 1 March 2012, calculated in line with the following rates and bands:<table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&euro;)<\/th><th>Reduction Rate<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>First 12,000<\/td><td>Exempt<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000<\/td><td>6 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000<\/td><td>9 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000<\/td><td>12 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000<\/td><td>20 %<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The pensions of those who retired on or after 1 March 2012 were not subject to PSPR originally as such pensions were based on reduced rates of salary applicable at the time of retirement following the 1 January 2010 pay reductions.<\/p><p>  In parallel with further pay reductions which came into effect from 1 July 2013, the Government decided that all Public Service pensioners, including former politicians, on pensions of &euro;32,500 and above would be required to take a further pension reduction; this was deemed necessary and appropriate and would ensure higher-paid pensioners would make a fair and proportionate additional contribution to the fiscal consolidation measures.  On that basis, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 provides that all Public Service pensions greater than &euro;32,500 are subject to a reduction with effect from 1 July 2013; pensions below that level are not affected.  This new reduction ranges from 2% to 5% on affected pensions and is being implemented by way of increasing and extending the existing PSPR rates outlined above.  To secure the reduction, an appropriate increase in the rates is being applied to<b><\/b> Public Service pensions above &euro;32,500 for those who retired prior to 1 March 2012, as follows:<table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&euro;)<\/th><th>Reduction Rate<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>First 12,000<\/td><td>Exempt<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000<\/td><td>8 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000<\/td><td>12 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000<\/td><td>17 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000<\/td><td>28 %<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  In the case of those who retired on pensions above &euro;32,500 since 1 March 2012 (i.e. those whose pensions were not subject to PSPR originally because their pensions were based on reduced salaries, unlike those who retired before 1 March 2012) the 2% to 5% pension reduction is being imposed by applying new separate PSPR rates.  The new rates introduced for this group are lower than the above revised rates applicable to the earlier (pre-March 2012) retirees.  The new rates are as follows:<table><tr><th>Annual Public Service Pension (&euro;)<\/th><th>Reduction Rate<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>First 12,000<\/td><td>Exempt<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 12,000 and 24,000<\/td><td>2 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 24,000 and 60,000<\/td><td>3 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 60,000 and 100,000<\/td><td>5 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Balance above 100,000<\/td><td>8 %<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to assure you that pay and pension costs will be kept under review as part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing strategy to bring the public finances to a sustainable level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900061#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haddington Road Agreement Implementation","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900061#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[49306\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900061#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way persons working in a particular sector, who are not members of a trade union, may still be bound by the terms of collective bargaining agreements such as the Haddington Road Agreement entered into by large trades unions representing that sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In both instances the extent to which protections under these sections can be invoked will be determined by the relevant elements of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery such as Rights Commissioners, the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal as appropriate.  In such cases all of the usual rights, processes and procedures associated with that machinery will apply. <\/p><p>  Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Bill provide protections the eventual determination of which will fall to be dealt with by the Courts and in which cases all of the usual rights, processes and procedures of the legal system will apply.

Section 14 provides that a person shall not be liable in damages, or subject to any other relief in civil proceedings, in respect of the making of a protected disclosure.

A failure to comply is actionable by the person by whom the protected disclosure was made if that person suffers any loss as a result.

The Code of Practice is to be prepared in consultation with both employer and employee representative groups and the public service, as a significant employer, will be represented in that process.

However, in parallel several facilities have been acquired or expanded in recent years, in particular in the area of biopharmaceuticals. Biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, Biomarin and Pfizer as examples.  Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.<\/p><p>  Ireland already has successful generic manufacturers such as Clonmel Healthcare, Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Teva and Rowa as examples.

The indigenous sector is highly innovative and dynamic with companies competing successfully in international markets throughout the world e.g. Sigmoid, Opsona, Alimentary Health, ICON, Chanelle, TopChem, Barclays, Eirgen, Arran Chemicals etc. ICON in particular is now the 3rd   largest contract research organisation in the world and the fastest growing for the last 7 years.<\/p><p>  Central to the success of Irish companies internationally has been their R&amp;amp;D capabilities, leadership and management strengths and collaborative partnerships with some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies in the sector.

A zero hour contract must be entered into freely between the employer and the employee &ndash; it cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hour contracts are, normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality.

Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  However this is an area I will keep under review.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a protection for employees who are employed on zero hour contracts.  The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  This feature of the Organisation of Working Time Act covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he\/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he\/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he\/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.<\/p><p>  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him\/herself available for work.<\/p><p>  Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero hour contracts.

Each year, Enterprise Ireland organises a series of targeted international trade missions, market visits, participation in international trade fairs and a large number of international buyer visits to Ireland focussed on assisting Irish firms target and secure international contracts and overseas partners.

As announced earlier this year, Irish companies supported by Enterprise Ireland set a new record for level of exports achieved - &euro;16.2Bn.

That Report, in 2001, concluded that, because of high costs and limited potential industrial development returns, membership should not be a priority.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources available has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country &ndash; most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government&rsquo;s priority in the area of science, technology and innovation is to implement the recommendations of the National Research Prioritisation Exercise which will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and social returns, particularly in the form of jobs.  The Steering Group which undertook the exercise included representatives of the enterprise sector and its terms of reference specifically required that it take account of complementary developments at EU level and other international initiatives.  Research in the area of particle physics was not identified as a priority nor was there any recommendation that Ireland should join CERN. <\/p><p>  The costs of full membership of CERN are understood to be over &euro;10 million per annum.  In addition to substantial fees for any type of membership, it is important to note that significant extra amounts of expenditure would be necessitated in order to ensure that Ireland benefits fully from membership.  While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved, as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  <\/p><p>  I am not aware that the fact that Ireland is not a member of CERN places Irish secondary students at a particular disadvantage relative to their UK, French, Italian or Spanish counterparts.  However, should budgetary circumstances change over the next few years, the question of membership of CERN could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost\/benefit viewpoint.  Also, the selected national research priority areas will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their continued relevance and to also ensure that new opportunities are identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900062#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900062#WRK03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobsPlus Scheme","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900062#WRK03150"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[48831\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900062#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she views the proposed extension of the JobsPlus programme from January 2014 to include those aged under 26 years and more that six months on the live register, to be in conformity with the Employment Equality Act and other such legislative measure designed to prevent employment discrimination on the basis of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[48830\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900062#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if employers who hire persons aged under 26 years and who are more than six months on the live register under the proposed extension of the JobsPlus programme from January 2014, will be in violation of the Employment Equality Act and other such legislative measures designed to prevent employment discrimination on the basis of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":588,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 294 and 298 together.<\/p><p>  JobsPlus is a new employer Incentive, from the Department of Social Protection which encourages and rewards employers who offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed. The Incentive replaced the existing Employer Job PRSI exemption and the Revenue Job Assist schemes with effect from the 1st July 2013.  JobsPlus takes the form of a cash grant payable monthly in arrears to the employer.  The value of the incentive is set at two levels: &euro;7,500 in respect a person 12 months but less than 24 months unemployed and &euro;10,000 for an employee previously over 24 months unemployed.  As of the week ending 8th November, 514 previously unemployed people had moved into employment with the support of JobsPlus.

A total of 23,235 placements have commenced to-date.  Please see Table 1 for a breakdown by county.  The evaluation report conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of all participants progressed into paid employment within 5 months of completing their internship.

The progression outcomes into employment for early finishers are very encouraging.  However, in order to address the dissatisfaction levels, I have extended the number of placements available on the Scheme and increased the maximum cumulative duration of internships.

","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are approximately 81,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;35 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  As part of the means test, there is a capital assessment completed (including savings, investments, property etc.).  Before the assessment is carried out, the capital is rounded down to the nearest &euro;1,000.  The first &euro;5,000 of capital is disregarded and the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000 per week.  Therefore an applicant with savings of &euro;10,000 would have means of &euro;5 per week assessed and an applicant with savings of &euro;13,500 would have means of &euro;8 per week assessed.<\/p><p>  There are many factors which determine rent supplement entitlement, including the number of hours worked, the level of earned income and any social welfare payments or whether the rent payable is within prescribed limits.  Based on the details provided by the Deputy, it is not possible to say for certain if the household would qualify for a rent supplement payment.  However, if the person is eligible for rent supplement and the savings are the only additional income, then the person&rsquo;s weekly rent supplement entitlement would be reduced by &euro;5 or &euro;8 as described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900063#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900063#WRL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[48913\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900063#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite a disability allowance payment and arrears due in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned took place on 07<sup>th<\/sup> November 2013 and that the Appeals Officer is now considering the appeal in the light of all of the evidence submitted, including that adduced at the oral hearing.

The sustainability of the wider system is a particular concern because of the demographic issues Ireland faces and the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and due to investment losses and the deterioration in the public finances since the recession.  <\/p><p>  Key drivers of reform have included the need to achieve sustainability of our systems over the longer term whilst also striving for adequacy in those systems.   This has included reforms to the State pension and public sector pensions and effort to increased supplementary pension coverage whilst working to ensure the continued viability of defined benefit pension schemes.   <\/p><p>  The National Pensions Framework was published in March 2010 and provided a framework for long term pension reform. It encompassed consideration of all aspects of pension reform including the State pension, supplementary occupational and private pensions and public sector pensions.<\/p><p>  Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the Green Paper consultation process. A number of the reforms set out in the National Pensions Framework have been implemented recently, including the increase in the State pension age, and more will be implemented in the coming years. These reforms are designed to enhance the sustainability of the system overall and ensure that people&rsquo;s income in retirement is protected.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Framework, it became necessary to further consider pension reform given the economic difficulties and deterioration in the public finances. In this regard, and at my request, in 2012 the Government engaged the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to conduct an independent review of long term pensions policy in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This review was published in April 2013 and encompasses the totality of pension provision in Ireland &ndash; State, private, occupational and public sector.  The issues of sustainability; adequacy; modernity; and equity were central to this review.  Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.   <\/p><p>  In this regard, you will be aware the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.  I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.<\/p><p>  The Kiwisaver Programme currently operating in New Zealand is an example of such an auto-enrolment scheme. Studies of this scheme, and others internationally, have shown that significant increases in pensions coverage can be obtained from such systems. In addition, the significantly larger economies of scale that result from such schemes have the capacity to achieve more competitive charging structures, which in turn would lead to improved returns for consumer members.   As was highlighted in the Pensions Charges Report 2012, this type of arrangement could assist in resolving the difficulties inherent in the current Irish scheme structure of a proliferation of small schemes paying considerably higher charges than larger schemes, ultimately eroding the value of the pension received by the member. <\/p><p>  While it is not planned to publish a white paper on pensions in the near future, analysis of the options available is on-going in my Department and I will be bringing proposals to Government as to how the OECD review will inform further developments in the area of pension policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Training Programmes Provision","counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM01550"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[49122\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when a place on the Naas technology project F&Aacute;S course will be offered in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been interviewed and is awaiting a place on the next available course which is scheduled for May 2014.

","asker":"980","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>The overall concern of the Government in this and previous budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments.   The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone.  While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence.  We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.   <\/p><p>  Of course it is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period. <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm.  Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance.  I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this.   <\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines. <\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":681,"content":"<p>Question No. 331 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[49130\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900064#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; the reason it took from May until October 2013 for the relevant papers to be forwarded to the independent appeals office; if this decision will be reviewed in view of additional medical evidence; if an oral hearing will be organised in respect of this case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Department of Social Protection has also engaged the assistance of the OECD in developing the Youth Guarantee Policy.<\/p><p>   It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee for consideration by the Government in December before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of 2013. Development of the implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met. (how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely support from EU funds, e.g. European Social Fund (ESF) and Youth Employment Initiative (ESF)).  <\/p><p>  For Ireland this plan will likely require:<\/p><p>-   Earmarking a quota of additional places\/opportunities for young people on existing schemes.<\/p><p>-   Varying the eligibility conditions for access to certain schemes by young people - for example reduce the eligibility criteria so that young people can access places\/opportunities after shorter spell of unemployment rather than the general requirement of 12 months unemployment.<\/p><p>-   Expanding the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p>  In 2012, we spent an estimated &euro;170m on participation in employment, training and further education programmes for jobless young people. Significant further amounts were expended on mainstream provision of further and higher education preparing young people for entry to working life. Final estimates of cost and participants for 2013 will be produced at the end of this year when full-year cost and participant estimates (including age-breakdowns) will be available.<\/p><p>  As an initial step towards preparing for implementation of the guarantee, provision was made in the 2014 Budget for:<\/p><p>-   reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months &ndash; to 6 months or less &ndash; in the case of persons aged less than 25 years<\/p><p>-   an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme<\/p><p>-   ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people<\/p><p>-   developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job<\/p><p>-   ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my department<\/p><p>-   the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.<\/p><p>  In total, the provision across these headings in the 2014 Budget comes to about &euro;46 million. The final amount of expenditure on youth programmes for 2014 cannot be predicted with certainty as it will in part be determined by the level of take-up by young people and the level of funding secured from the EU and on the mix of programmes involved. It is however likely to be significantly up on 2012 levels.<\/p><p>  Given the scale of existing and future provision it is clear that the bulk of funding for labour market programmes for young people will continue to come from domestic exchequer sources. We will however endeavour to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s share of the additional funding available from the EU. <\/p><p>  It is estimated that EU funding (ESF and YEI) for these programmes will be of the order of &euro;64 million in respect of each of the years 2014 and 2015. Given the way the funding is structured, in order to recoup these amounts from the EU in due course, it will be necessary that we spend, in the first instance, close to &euro;100 million on relevant programmes each year, or close to &euro;200 million in 2014-2015 overall. As will be clear from the above, it is anticipated that actual expenditure will be significantly in excess of that amount over the period concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Payments","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN01250"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[49384\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason child benefit has ceased in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>Child benefit is paid up to and including the month of a child&rsquo;s 16th birthday and continues to the month of the 18<sup>th<\/sup>  birthday provided the child is in full-time education.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. <\/p><p>  These changes are already provided for in legislation. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   <\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.   In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, just 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. <\/p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66. The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history. <\/p><p>  There are two other related provisions; one provides that in the case of a job seeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year.   A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year<\/p><p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2014,  I was happy to be able to introduce  new arrangements for older jobseekers, i.e. those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  <\/p><p>  With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments.  Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures but may avail of employment supports which will continue to be available to them and they will not be subject to activation-related sanctions.<\/p><p>  Finally social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN02950"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[49485\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900065#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there is a different provision made available for part-time firemen when it comes to the issue of drawing their stamps; if she will explain exactly what this is; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>Over 2,000 persons are employed as retained (part-time) fire-fighters, providing services which are vitally important to their communities.

Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.<\/p><p>  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 carried amendments to both jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis.

Time spent on JobBridge counts towards the qualifying period and persons pursuing internships under JobBridge who were in receipt of a qualifying payment prior to their internship may be employed directly from this scheme once the required qualifying period and conditions are satisfied.  An employer and employee should apply on online as normal in these circumstances.  Once eligibility has been confirmed employment from directly from an internship can be facilitated.<\/p><p>  The incentive provides two levels of payment; a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years to an employer for persons recruited who have been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months and a payment of &euro;10,000 over two years to an employer who recruits a person who has been 2 years or more on the live register.  The JobsPlus Incentive is administered by Employment Support Services, Department of Social Protection, Shannon Lodge, Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim.

That reply also outlined the series of items which are being undertaken by my Department over the broad area of commemorations. <\/p><p>  In keeping with the development of an authentic programme, I anticipate that all the principal sites relating to the Rising and ensuing events will feature in the commemorations. Local as well as national events will feature and, in this regard, I would encourage interested parties and community groups to co-ordinate their ideas and proposals so as to ensure the optimal arrangements with regard to the historic events in their areas that should be commemorated.  Imaginative ways of undertaking these commemorations should be explored by such interested parties and emphasis placed on local participation.<\/p><p>  I particularly wish to encourage Local Authorities to utilise their arts and heritage offices as they support and co-ordinate commemorative activities in their jurisdiction. <\/p><p>  As I have previously outlined, the commemorative programme is proceeding on the historic centenary timeline. With regard to the centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers, I met a number of local historians on 2 September 2013 at the County Library in Tralee to explore the possibility of arranging a lecture to commemorate the founding. It was decided to arrange a lecture to take place on Thursday 28 November at the County Library in Tralee.<\/p><p>  The arrangements in 2014 will include commemorations of gun-running events, the formation of Cumann na mBan as well as the founding of the Irish Citizens' Army. Commemorative arrangements for 2016 will be announced on a continuing basis over the coming months, to include certain capital projects and events. This process requires consideration about the most relevant type, scope and focus of commemoration for events and how they should be undertaken. As I indicated previously, it is my belief that the Rising can best be commemorated by placing it in the broader cultural and historical context. In this regard, we have brought forward projects such as the <i>Century Ireland<\/i>   initiative, in association with RT&Eacute; and Boston College, which is already charting the lives of the participants in the Rising from their first appearances in public life through to the Rising itself.<\/p><p>  Clearly, the centenary of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be a most important anniversary and I anticipate that the special arrangements for the occasion will be of interest internationally too.  <\/p><p>  As I mentioned in my earlier reply, I would welcome the Deputies' views on the commemoration of the Rising and would be happy to discuss any relevant proposals submitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900066#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900066#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[49149\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900066#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when his Department will be in a position to arrange a meeting with his officials on a site (details supplied) in County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":783,"content":"<p>In 2010, the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recommended that permission be refused by Offaly County Council for the extension proposed in the case referred to by the Deputy.

As shareholder, however, I have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. <\/p><p>  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country. I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins. <\/p><p>  I read the Irish Postmasters' Union report on The Future of the Post Office Network and earlier this year I emphasised to the IPU the intrinsic strengths of the network and the opportunities for new developments.<\/p><p>I have welcomed the selection of An Post as the provider of over the counter cash services for social welfare customers.  The social welfare contract is the largest contract held by the post office division of An Post. The Department of Social Protection intends to implement a strategy whereby the bulk of social welfare payments will be made electronically. I understand An Post will pitch strongly for the social welfare e-payment business when it is put out to tender by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, An Post is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and financial services sector. Progress towards diversification within the financial services sector is already underway with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and the agreement with Aviva for the transfer of their branch offices personal insurance business to One Direct.<\/p><p>  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions. I see a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player as a front office for Government services. In this connection, An Post has secured over the counter Local Property Tax payments.

To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds, supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore and by maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime.  In that regard I recently announced the headline details for the next licensing round to be held in Ireland's Atlantic Margin, with a closing date of September 2015.  Providing advance details of the round will encourage industry to devote resources to preparing for participation in the round. <\/p><p>  Conscious that the existence of quality data is key to encouraging exploration, last June my Department, in conjunction with exploration company Eni launched a major seismic acquisition programme to provide a regional grid of high quality seismic data over our Atlantic frontier basins, particularly in the Southern Porcupine, Rockall and Hatton basins.  It is by far the largest regional seismic survey to be acquired in the Irish offshore and was designed to complement existing datasets and to fill data gaps that exist.  The survey will add to the understanding of the petroleum potential of our frontier basins and should provide a boost to our efforts to attract international mobile exploration investment to Ireland in the next licensing round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Sector Regulation","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[49469\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the advertising rates charged to registered charities by RTE television and radio; and the State subsidy, if any, that is given towards the cost of suicide prevention and awareness campaigns on RTE.

Questions concerning usage of this revenue should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014.  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014.  Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.   <\/p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014.  The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.  It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue.   <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[48859\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900068#WRQ03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when additional funds will be made available for re-distribution to Leader companies that have approved ready-to-go projects; the amount of Leader funding ring-fenced for projects in the areas serviced by WCDP; when he will make an decision on the funding for such projects, including an indication of the additional budget likely to become available as well as details on the process for reallocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions holistically to address housing needs. <\/p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.

There are just over 500 organisations currently listed as approved housing bodies.  My Department is currently developing a regulatory framework for the sector.  A landmark first step in this regard was the publication on 15 July 2013 of Building for the Future , a voluntary regulation code for the sector that is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i><\/i>.  The code proposes three tiers or organisational classifications, of which tier 3 includes the largest organisations, i.e. those bodies with more than 300 housing units or with development plans in place to provide significantly more units.  To date, just under 70 approved housing bodies have signed up to the voluntary regulation code, of which five would be classified as tier 3.  My Department does not impose restrictions on approved housing bodies seeking to raise finance from external sources.  However, the development of a regulatory framework is expected to facilitate enhanced access to external funding sources.  The voluntary regulation code sets out key governance, management and financial principles that apply to approved housing bodies.  Organisations signing up to the code must sign a Charter of Commitments relevant to their scale and development plans.  My Department is also working in partnership with the sector to develop a specific additional financial chapter to be appended to the VRC that will, <i>inter alia<\/i> , set out key financial management rules and principles.  The Department, together with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, is working with the Irish Council for Social Housing and NABCO, the National Association of Building Co-operatives, to maximise engagement with the voluntary process.  In the final analysis, the voluntary regulation code constitutes a foundation for the development of a statutory regulatory system, and my Department is working with partners in the sector in that regard.  As part of this work, models of best practice for regulation of the sector are being examined, including those in place in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900070#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1021,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 464 and 465 answered with Question No. 431.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Issues","counter":1022,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900070#WRS01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1023,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[49305\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900070#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances where individuals may not be permitted entry onto a local authority housing waiting list due to the failure by their existing landlord to register with the Private Residential Tenancies Board; his views that this represents an unfair burden upon the applicant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1024,"content":"<p>My Department is not aware of any particular instances whereby applicants are being denied access to local authority waiting lists due to unregistered landlords.

The law relating to the protection of personal data, including the credit card data of individuals, is set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  This legislation requires, for example, that personal data are obtained for one or more specified, explicit and legitimate purposes; that they are not further processed in a manner inconsistent with that purpose or those purposes; that they are not excessive in respect of that purpose or purposes; and, importantly, that they are not kept for longer than is necessary.  The legislation also requires that appropriate security measures be taken to guard against unauthorised access to, as well as any unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of, such personal data.  Moreover, it allows the Data Protection Commissioner to carry out investigations of infringements of the legislation on receipt of a complaint or on his or her own initiative.  In 2011, the Data Protection Commissioner introduced a Code of Practice on Personal Data Security Breaches under section 13(2)(b) of the Data Protection Act 1988.  The Code provides guidance on good practice in dealing with data security breaches, including the reporting of such breaches to the Commissioner's Office.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Data Protection Commissioner that his Office was notified of the data security breach referred to by the Deputy in accordance with this Code of Practice.

I understand that the Commissioner has received a preliminary report on the findings of the inspection team.  I also understand that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations has received a report on the matter and is investigating the issue further.  The European Commission published a Proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation in January 2012.  The Proposal includes specific provisions, which I fully support, requiring the notification of certain personal data breaches to relevant supervisory authorities and, in serious cases, to individuals who may be affected by them.  Negotiations on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are ongoing at EU level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900072#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Search and Rescue Service","counter":1112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900072#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[49230\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900072#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide direction for a safety procedure (details supplied) to be enforced; if this procedure has been enforced in any other region or in respect of any other community organisation; if he will reverse this decision and allow for Meath river rescue to operate in a fully integrated and efficient manner.

Such rules are drawn up by the respective Court Rules Committees and any new arrangements in respect of such proceedings will be a matter, in the first instance, for these Committees.  I should add that the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 contains two important new provisions which will be of benefit to borrowers with arrears: section 2 provides that in any future repossession proceedings in respect of the borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence, the court may adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession; section 3 introduces a new requirement whereby repossession actions in respect of mortgages on principal private residences and family homes which were created prior to 1 December 2009 must be commenced in the Circuit Court.<\/p><p>  As regards the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the position is that it applies to the principal private residence of the borrower.

The Visa Officer did not consider that the family concerned provided sufficient evidence of their obligations to return following a visit to Ireland and had concerns that they would not observe the conditions of the visas were they to be approved.  In addition, insufficient documentary evidence was submitted to indicate adequate levels of available finances or income in respect of either the family concerned or the reference in Ireland.

As this certification was not a condition of service for officers recruited prior to September 2007, to award marks for this qualification would unfairly disadvantage such staff.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that officers who were recruited before the introduction of the HCCC would not be disadvantaged, these officers were also awarded 25 marks, equivalent to their HCCC-qualified colleagues. In many cases these officers already had a level 6 or higher relevant qualification and were not awarded any additional marks.<\/p><p>  It is not the case that applicants who possessed higher qualifications for the advertised post were not given extra credit for the higher qualifications.  Any applicant who had a relevant qualification at a higher level than the HCCC received the appropriate score for that qualification in line with the marking scheme outlined in the competition circular (see the following table).<table><tr><th><b>National Framework of Qualifications<\/b><\/th><th><b>Marks awarded<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Levels 1 - 3<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Levels 4 - 5<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level 6<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level 7<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level 8<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level 9<\/td><td>40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level 10<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>For example, an applicant for Work Training Officer - Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) and Work Training Officer - Catering posts with an honours degree (level 8) in Criminology would have been awarded an extra 10 marks (35 marks in total) for the ISM post but no extra marks for the Catering post.

For example, while the requirement to have full medical insurance is a sine qua non, in these cases this of itself is no guarantee of such an application not being a burden on the State. In some jurisdictions inward immigration of  this nature is prohibited entirely and in others lengthy waiting periods are involved or large financial investments are required prior to  any definitive relocation taking place.   For approval to be given to an application therefore the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service would have to be fully satisfied that no costs to the State will arise at any point from that person's residence here.  Therefore the person would need to have a guaranteed and sustainable annual income sufficient for their foreseeable needs and have full medical cover.  The immigration status granted is stamp 0 which is specifically aimed at providing an opportunity to remain in the State but to confer no expectation of eligibility for State funds or that is should be a pathway to long term residence or citizenship.  Stamp 0 permission is made conditional on not becoming a burden on the State and for it to be renewed this condition must continue to be met.  <\/p><p>  There are also other avenues available to self sufficient retirees.

As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar. <\/p><p>  The general position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its 2004 Report 'Private Property'. The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant. In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area. However, operation of the existing law continues to be kept under review by my Department.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">    <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900073#WRV05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900073#WRV05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[49513\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900073#WRV06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an earned regularisation scheme for undocumented migrants currently living in Ireland, for example, based on a points system, will be included in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.

It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the majority of migrants comply with this condition. <\/p><p>  I understand that the programme introduced in 2009 related to a very specific subset of the overall population of illegally present foreign nationals, namely those who had previously held an employment permit but had since, through no fault of their own, become undocumented.   It provided, subject to a requirement that each case be considered on its merits, for a short term bridging permission to allow the person to apply for a new employment permit.  I also understand that currently where similar cases are presented to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service they are dealt with in the same way as under that programme.  <\/p><p>  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Clearly, all illegal migration cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances.   At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct. <\/p><p>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.   However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.<\/p><p>  Finally, I should point out that in relation to the estimate given by the Deputy of some 30,000 undocumented migrants in Ireland, and while I have seen the same figure quoted myself, I am unaware of the statistical basis for this figure and accordingly am not in a position either to endorse it or propose an alternative.  Illegal migration is inherently extremely difficult to measure.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900073#WRV06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Records","counter":1223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900074#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1224,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[49520\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900074#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to make audio recordings of court proceedings available to the public in an accessible manner in view of the fact that substantial investment took place in all courthouses to make this possible.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1225,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[49521\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900074#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the fact that it is private companies which operate the stenographer system in the courts; and the remedies that are open to citizens when the accuracy of a transcript is disputed.

However, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely:<\/p><p>  - ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities;<\/p><p>  - maintaining the countryside; and<\/p><p>  - maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  Provision was made for an appeals process to take account of a variety of situations, specifically:<\/p><p>  - Restriction on the stocking levels on the holding due to adherence to an agri-environments plan such as REPS, AEOS or National Parks and Wildlife Service plan.<\/p><p>  - Farming marginal land where the level of stock that can be maintained is restricted.<\/p><p>  - Illness or death in family.<\/p><p>  - Outbreak of animal disease in the herd.<\/p><p>  - New entrant to farming.<\/p><p>  At the same time, I was also determined that those adversely affected by the 2012 changes should be afforded the opportunity to appeal, where they could show legitimate reasons for their inability to meet the new requirements.

","asker":"980","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1441,"content":"<p>The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place. During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid  declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31st October 2013. <\/p><p>  By their nature transitional provisions must be time limited, and it was considered by the Government at the time, and the Oireachtas, that three years was a reasonable period of time to finalise an adoption which was in process when the Adoption Act 2010 came into force. The Hague Convention sets out important safeguards to be implemented by member countries so as to ensure that the rights of children and families are protected and there is prevention of illegal, irregular, premature or ill prepared inter country adoptions.  Ireland has ratified the Hague Convention and under the Adoption Act 2010 the Convention has force of law in Ireland. The provisions of the Adoption Act 2010 sought to balance the desire for a reasonable period of transition with the overall commitment  to the mutual support amongst member countries for the operation of the standards and safeguards in inter country adoption outlined in the Convention. <\/p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when  changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  I am conscious of the strain that these prospective adoptive parents have experienced due to recent events which could not have been foreseen. Since this issue was brought to my attention, officials in my Department have been seeking a way to address the problems which resulted from the sudden change in Russian legislation. Considerable efforts have been made, including through diplomatic channels, to see if the problems which have arisen can be resolved.<\/p><p>  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. <\/p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General was sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention. I have already met and spoken with some of those prospective adoptive parents affected by the  changes in Russian legislation and have undertaken to keep them informed of any developments.<\/p><p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to a possible  bilateral agreement on inter country adoption with Russia. Following my invitation to the Russian Ministry of Education and Science in August, a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland for discussions and the meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive with detailed discussions  between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the HSE. At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department has committed to reverting to the Russian side in the coming weeks with further detailed proposals in an effort to address both Russian and  Irish legal and administrative requirements to the greatest degree possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900077#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":1442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900077#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[48945\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900077#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding she is making available for youth funding this year; the amount being allocated to each body in comparison with the 2013 allocation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.

It is described as an 'opportunity to refocus on the role of families in development; take stock of recent trends in family policy development; share good practice in family policy making; review challenges faced by families worldwide and recommend solutions&rsquo;.  Obviously the scope of the initiative is very broad and has relevance to various Departments and agencies.  The focus of the initiative has particular resonance in the context of children and family services in Ireland, given the decision taken by Government to establish a new Child and Family Agency from January next year.  <\/p><p>  The legislation to establish the new Agency, the Child and Family Agency Bill, is progressing through the Oireachtas at present, and it is my intention that the Agency will be established from 1st January 2014. The policy intent in framing the functions of the Child and Family Agency has been to broaden the scope of the Agency beyond the traditional concept of child welfare and protection and to place emphasis on family support as an essential and discrete area of activity.  In this regard specific attention has been paid to strengthening and consolidating the family support function within the Child and Family Agency Bill, which will encompass both the existing family support obligations imposed by the Child Care Act 1991 (and currently discharged by the HSE) along with the important work undertaken by the Family Support Agency (FSA). Family support is being viewed not only as a response to identified welfare and protection needs, but as a preventative strategy generally.  This is in line with the general commitment to broaden the scope of the Agency and to underline the intended policy shift to an approach based more on prevention and early intervention strategies.

Surveys to measure the effectiveness of water fluoridation on children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; oral health include national studies in 1984, 1990, 2001 and 2002, regional studies between 1990 and 1999 and a cross border study in 2006.

It is of course understood and accepted that any private patient can opt to avail of public patient status but only by following public referral pathways: private status cannot be used as a system of skipping waiting lists for the purposes of prioritised access. Therefore referral for patients to attend a hospital consultant in a private capacity are not now nor were they previously eligible for consideration under TAS.<\/p><p>  Private patients applying to the TAS for funding are advised to seek such funding through their private health insurance provider in the first instance. In the instances where a patient's private health insurance provider will not cover either all of or any portion of the cost of the required treatment, the patient can revert to the TAS providing a copy of the written decision from his\/her private health insurance provider. on receipt of this documentation, the TAS will consider each application on a case by case basis.<\/p><p>  Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision. Previous approvals or refusals are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.

The introduction of Hospital Groups will provide for organisational change in the first instance, giving more autonomy and better enabling the reorganisation of services in a well-planned manner. Over time, this will help to improve services and deliver better outcomes for patients. The Smaller Hospitals Framework, which will be implemented in the context of the Hospital Groups, defines the role of the smaller hospital and role of smaller hospitals within the Group and outlines in detail the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital and that can be transferred from the larger to smaller hospitals within the hospital group. <\/p><p>  Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, is part of the Dublin East Hospital Group. The reforms outlined above can be expected to result in change at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan and, indeed, at most if not all hospitals across all Groups.  However, Navan, as with all hospitals, will play a significant role in its Group in providing sustainable, safe and effective care at the appropriate level of complexity.  The provision of services at Navan and all other hospitals will be examined in the context of Strategic Plans to be developed by each Hospital Group. The development of Strategic Plans will afford an opportunity for the challenges and opportunities of service reconfiguration to be fully considered. Strategic Plans will be prepared in the context of an overarching policy framework to be developed by my Department, and their preparation will afford an opportunity for all hospitals in a Group to work together to address the opportunities and challenges of service reorganisation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900080#WRCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900080#WRCC01925"},{"type":"question","counter":1606,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[49217\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900080#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the Health Service Executive continues to stop &euro;71.45 from pension payments being made to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny.

","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>The prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT. <\/p><p>  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.<\/p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<\/p><p>Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. <\/p><p>The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicines on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the top 20 priority medicines by mid- 2014.    The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed. <\/p><p>Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.   Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1717,"content":"<p><i>  Question No. 712 withdrawn.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE01400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Disease Screening Service","counter":1718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1719,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[49510\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has secured expert advice in relation to the development of an anti malaria policy; the names and qualifications of those providing such advice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.   The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year.\u00a0The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances. This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the\u00a0initial costs budgeted for\u00a0by the project partners for the construction of the bridge.\u00a0The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depends entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive. These commitments have not as yet been forthcoming.\u00a0<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet,unfortunately, there will\u00a0be a\u00a0further reduction in regional and local\u00a0roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million. Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend.<\/p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed at the North South Ministerial Council on a number of occasions most recently on the 8th of November. In the Plenary Joint Communiqu&eacute; issued subsequent to that meeting, it was stated that &quot;Ministers remain supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge and have asked for an urgent analysis of the issues involved. \u00a0They remain conscious that the priority is not to lose the EU funding involved.&quot;<\/p><p>  It is important to note that there are\u00a0time constraints with regard to the SEUPB funding, which has to be spent by 2015.\u00a0SEUPB has now decided to withdraw the letter of offer. The SEUPB is now exploring options for the reallocation of this funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered by December 2015. While this development is unfortunate, this is a project that the Government would like to see delivered in the future and remains committed to. However, we simply do not have the scale of\u00a0resources required to advance it at this stage when the priority must be on road maintenance and restoration as against new projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Improvement Schemes","counter":1751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1752,"qnumday":724,"qnumall":"[49426\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900082#WREE03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the level of funding that will be made available in respect of local improvement schemes to the local authorities in counties Westmeath and Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The change in 1989 meant that in future there were separate categories, one for cars and\u00a0others for cars with trailers, for motorcycles or for trucks. People requiring to tow trailers or to drive vehicles other than cars were, from then on, required to pass a test in that category.\u00a0\u00a0 People who had a full licence before the change were allowed, when renewing their licences, to claim both of the new categories.\u00a0 To do so, they had to tick boxes for each category on their renewal forms.<\/p><p>  It appears that a number of people\u00a0renewed their licences for the car only category.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I received representations from farming organisations on behalf of people who had\u00a0 realised belatedly that they had lost the trailer entitlement which they had held prior to 1989.\u00a0 On consideration of the issue, I decided that people who could prove that they had held a full driving licence pre-1989 - that is, had originally held a full entitlement to draw a trailer - should be allowed to reclaim their trailer entitlement.\u00a0 I made it clear that this was a once-off arrangement and specific to the trailer entitlement.\u00a0 I have no plans to make arrangements of this kind in other cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111900083#WRFF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"}]
