I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I discussed the matter with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and I will likewise be pursuing the issue directly with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Question No. 10 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[3688\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Government has prepared and finalised Brexit sectoral response plans for each Department as committed to in May 2017; if so, if he will publish these plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[3505\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the development of adaptive sectoral response plans to Brexit, including plans for stakeholder consultation and publication timelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[3492\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has carried out an analysis of the potential impact of Brexit here by county with particular reference to County Wexford.","asker":"1354","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13 and 39 together.<\/p>  <p>  The situation with regard to the Brexit negotiations has evolved significantly since the publication of the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive approach document last May and the Government&rsquo;s preparations have adjusted accordingly. Contingency planning at both a domestic and an EU level is focused on three areas: preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo;; preparing for a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;; and preparing for the future EU-UK relationship. <\/p>  <p>  While the outcome of the December European Council and the move on to Phase 2 has lessened the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit, very detailed work on a no-deal or worst-case-scenario is advancing intensively through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Before Christmas, the possible consequences for each sector were comprehensively established.  Now the work is focusing on possible mitigating measures.  This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement. Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses.<\/p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This includes, as appropriate, any specific responses necessary according to regional needs and at the county level, including in Wexford. <\/p>  <p>  That is why the decision has been taken to concentrate on completing this work and to participate in the preparation of the EU approach to the future relationship negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  As concerns transitional arrangements, I welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.  Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force. <\/p>  <p>  The expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship. These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations. This will provide a basis on which the Government will publish a new paper in the coming months on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them. <\/p>  <p>  This work will, of course, be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  Much of this is in the public domain, including the detailed response plan \"Building Stronger Business - Responding to Brexit by competing, innovation and trading\", which was published in November. A number of further important studies are underway with a view to publication in the coming weeks and months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[3504\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will request the release of a person (details supplied); his views on the position of UNICEF that the ill-treatment of Palestinian children in military detention is widespread, systematic and institutionalised; his further views on the fact that Israel is the only nation that systematically detains and prosecutes children in a military court system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[3653\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed the detention of Palestinian children and teenagers by the Israeli authorities with Israeli representatives here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 28 together.<\/p>  <p>  The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern.

I have made clear that I believe the US announcement was premature and unhelpful. The EU has reaffirmed our belief in a two state solution, with Jerusalem as a capital for both Israel and Palestine.   At the January meeting of the PLO Central Council there was evidently deep frustration not just at the US announcement, but also at the lack of progress over two decades in building on the Oslo Accords. Some statements made at the Central Council included inflammatory rhetoric. The Central Council also decided to assign the Executive Committee of the PLO to suspend recognition of Israel, pending reciprocal recognition of a State of Palestine. <\/p>  <p>  However, this decision has not yet been implemented. It will be for President Abbas to decide whether to act on this recommendation, and so far, he has not done so. I believe that the international community should focus on actions, not rhetoric.

The war is now ongoing for over one thousand days, and has had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life. I am aware of the UNICEF report referred to by the Deputy, and share his concern that children are bearing the brunt of the conflict in Yemen, with nearly every child in the country currently in need of humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining support. In 2017, Irish funding of over &euro;5 million was allocated to the UN&rsquo;s Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund (YHPF), which supports NGOs and UN agencies, including UNICEF, which have the best capacity to deliver services on the ground. Furthermore, the EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget. In addition, Ireland provided &euro;7.2 million in core global funding to UNICEF in 2017, and has pledged a further &euro;7.2 million for 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict. Ireland fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, Ireland does not have an arms industry and therefore does not export arms to Saudi Arabia. On the problems posed by arms transfers to conflict regions generally, our efforts are concentrated on universalisation and implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which has been signed and ratified by all EU Member States. In addition, the EU&rsquo;s Common Position on Arms Exports contains 8 risk assessment criteria that all EU countries must apply to their licensing decisions for exports of military goods. <\/p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year, and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access. There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue. At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the death sentence of a Baha&rsquo;i individual to which the Deputy has referred, I am concerned that this person appears to have been sentenced on the basis of his religious beliefs. Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, and is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty. Ireland calls on all parties in Yemen to immediately release all Baha&rsquo;i detained due to their religious belief, and to cease the harassment to which they are subjected. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA02650"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[3643\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500054#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to Israel and Palestine; if he drew the attention of the Israeli Prime Minister to Ireland&rsquo;s opposition to Israel&rsquo;s occupation of Palestine and the apartheid regime that Israel enforces in Palestine; if he will request that the State officially recognises the state of Palestine; and if he will request the release of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1258","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>Earlier this month, I visited Israel and Palestine for the second time in my role Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Ireland, along with our EU partners, supports the achievement of a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that meets Israeli and Palestinian security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, ends the occupation that began in 1967, and resolves all permanent status issues in order to end the conflict.Ireland has long looked forward to being able to recognise a sovereign Palestinian state existing in fact and not just in theory. Ireland normally recognises states that actually exist and control their territory, and so successive Irish Governments have seen recognition of Palestine coming as part of an overall peace agreement.  However, in view of the long-term frustration of that ideal, and in particular in the light of the motions passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in 2014, some have suggested early recognition now by Ireland of a state of Palestine, in advance of its actual achievement on the ground, could play a helpful part in advancing a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <\/p>  <p>  There are many varied factors bearing on this question. They include the likely impact of such a move on the peace process, the possible value of recognition as a symbolic gesture, the likely impact on other initiatives and perception by other actors, and the likely effect on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the issue.

In phase one we secured concrete commitments on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process. We have also secured clear and strong commitments on avoiding a hard border and the UK has set out, for the first time, how this will be achieved.In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, the UK has committed that &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy, and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo; It has also been agreed that any arrangements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight.   The importance of avoiding a hard border to people living in all the border counties, including Cavan and Monaghan, cannot be underestimated and the Government is acutely conscious of this. The North South cooperation we enjoy today brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people in the border region and contributes to economic opportunity and development.

Officials from my Department continue to closely monitor developments and the Government is very engaged on this issue both at EU level and with our international partners. While I welcome efforts being made to provide a path for the return of refugees to their place of origin in Myanmar, it is vital that any such efforts be carried out in a safe, dignified, and voluntary manner and that the UN be part of any repatriation scheme. I emphasise the importance of recognising the status of those who have fled as refugees and the full application of international refugee law to their individual cases; in particular insisting that any repatriation must be voluntary.    In this regard I note recent news that efforts to begin repatriations this month have been delayed by the Government of Bangladesh. To ensure the safety and dignity of those returning, repatriations should only occur when there are appropriate conditions created on the ground in Rakhine State, in line with the findings of the Annan Commission and with the assistance of the international community. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting these refugees and the international humanitarian response triggered by the mass movement of refugees into Bangladesh.

Delivering a comprehensive, strategic approach to high-level visits and trade missions, including St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Ministerial programmes, is a key commitment of the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy Ireland Connected, launched in March 2017 and an outcome of the recent Team Ireland Conference.   This year, the Taoiseach, Government Ministers, Chief Whip and I will participate in programmes to promote Ireland and Irish interests in more than 30 countries across the globe during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  The majority of the destinations chosen are priority markets for Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism and investment interests, where a high-level political presence will reinforce the year-round promotional efforts of our diplomatic teams and state agencies in market.  Ministerial visits to the EU have been prioritised in 2018 given the importance of building strategic alliances in the context of Phase II of the Brexit negotiations and, looking forward, a post-Brexit European Union.

We are one of three candidates for the two seats available to members of the Western European and Others regional group at the United Nations.   Canada and Norway are the other two candidates. In order to be elected to the Security Council, Ireland will need to secure the support of two-thirds of the UN membership &ndash; approximately 129 votes of the 193 Member States.The UN provides the foundation of an orderly, rules-based international system, which is essential for a small and globally trading country like Ireland.  We have a responsibility to participate to the fullest extent possible in the work of the UN, and it is in our interests to do so.  By advocating for its role and values we are promoting our own values and interests.      The Security Council is the body which mandates peacekeeping missions and sets the policies that UN troops must follow in the field.   Over 1,000 Irish men and women serve each year under UN mandated peace support operations, representing our people and our values. Membership of the Security Council would be a valuable opportunity for Ireland to influence decisions which will affect the conditions and circumstances under which the members of our Defence Forces are deployed. <\/p>  <p>  Security Council membership would also give us an avenue to influence initiatives on conflict prevention, a priority area for Ireland, where we have called for increased investment and a stronger role for women in the maintenance of international peace and security. <\/p>  <p>  Other policy areas of growing influence on international peace and security include migration, climate change, sustainable development and food security. Additionally, the link between youth, peace and security is increasingly recognised as an area of importance and one which the Security Council will need to address in a comprehensive way. <\/p>  <p>  The campaign leading up to the 2020 election is already well under way.  While the House will understand that I cannot provide specific information on bilateral contacts which are being made in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s candidature, I am using every opportunity to press the value of Ireland playing our role on the Council. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic staff in Ireland, our Permanent Representation to the UN in New York, and our entire Embassy network have been actively presenting our case and seeking support. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s strong and sustained record of participation in UN peacekeeping operations is being emphasised as part of our campaign for election to the Security Council. Irish troops have been on duty for the UN since 1958, sixty years ago this year.  We are Europe&rsquo;s largest per capita contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations. Our peacekeepers have played a key role in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation through their work for the UN.  Our commitment to building peace, as a small island nation with our own troubled history, resonates with many UN member states. We understand the complexities of conflict, and seek to share our own lived experience of addressing it. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s previous terms on the Security Council have provided an opportunity to give firm practical expression to the principles underlying Irish foreign policy.  These principles are widely held across the Oireachtas.  A strong campaign will be required to secure election in 2020. Should we succeed, our election will allow Ireland to again bring our values of peace, justice and human rights to bear in directing the work of the Security Council. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":99,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 20.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":101,"content":"<p>Question No. 43 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[3687\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has formally raised the issue of Christian persecution at the UN and the EU Foreign Affairs Council; the actions being taken by his Department in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>Under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.   This right, which is replicated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, includes freedom to change one&rsquo;s religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one&rsquo;s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur and who the victims are. Our commitment to promoting freedom of religion and belief is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World, published in January 2015 and more recently in the Programme for Partnership Government. We work to advance this commitment at the EU, the UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and through our bilateral contacts.    We regularly condemn acts of persecution based on religion or belief at the UN General Assembly, raising our concern for the continued discrimination, intimidation and systematic harassment of members of Muslim, Christian and Baha&rsquo;i communities, as well as those belonging to non-traditional religious or belief movements.  <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, during the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief at UNGA in October 2017, Ireland welcomed the focus of the Special Rapporteur on gender-specific abuses against women and girls with regard to the right to freedom of religion or belief and stressed engagement with civil society actors, including existing regional and national human rights mechanisms, in carrying out the mandate.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also speaks on the rights of religious minorities at the Human Rights Council where we strongly condemn all forms of persecution and violence committed on the basis of religion or belief and call on all States to prevent such acts.   In 2017, we expressed our concerns about the persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East region, Eritrea, Myanmar, Iran and the DPRK.

The UN estimates that over 145 million people are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection, mainly as a result of conflict, but also natural disasters.  $24.7 billion is needed in 2018 to respond effectively to urgent humanitarian needs. Humanitarian crises are complex in nature, frequently resulting in significant displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels, and serious concerns for the protection of civilians.  Such crises require a coordinated response from the international community and, to this end, Ireland engages closely with our UN, EU, Red Cross and other partners. In 2016, over 75% of our humanitarian funding was provided through the UN and EU, with a similar amount in 2017.    This coordinated response better enables us to reach those in urgent need of assistance. In 2017, despite the huge gap between the total requirements of the UN-led appeals and funding received, the international community provided record levels of funding and their coordinated response reached tens of millions of people, more than ever before, saving millions of lives. Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) since it was established in 2012, enabling a rapid humanitarian response whenever and wherever crises hit.

We have secured concrete commitments on the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, and on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.

Ireland, along with our EU partners, supports the achievement of a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that meets Israeli and Palestinian security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, ends the occupation that began in 1967, and resolves all permanent status issues in order to end the conflict.Ireland has long looked forward to being able to recognise a sovereign Palestinian state existing in fact and not just in theory.  Ireland normally recognises states that actually exist and control their territory, and so successive Irish Governments have seen recognition of Palestine coming as part of an overall peace agreement.    There are many varied factors bearing on the question of recognition.  They include the likely impact of such a move on the peace process, the possible value of recognition as a symbolic gesture, the likely impact on other initiatives and perception by other actors, and the likely effect on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the issue.

The EU remains open to all options, in line with the principles agreed by the European Council. There is no doubt that the EU, including Ireland, will continue to trade with the UK after it leaves the Union. The scope of this trade and the conditions under which it will be conducted is subject to negotiations.

In these meetings, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s willingness to support US efforts to re-launch negotiations.    It is, of course, important that any parameters which are advanced actually provide a basis on which both parties could agree, and for this reason the EU has long been committed to a two-state solution, using 1967 borders as a basis, and with Jerusalem as a capital for both states.<\/p>  <p>  In discussions on the Middle East Peace Process with my EU colleagues, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, I have supported continuing EU efforts to encourage an appropriate US initiative. I also believe that the EU must continue our own work, including work on the ground to help preserve and create the political and physical space for a two state solution, and to alleviate the impact of the occupation on ordinary Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done. <\/p>  <p>  During an informal lunch with President Abbas after the Council, my colleagues and I reiterated the EU&rsquo;s unified position on the need to preserve a two-state solution, and the status of Jerusalem as future capital of two states. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[3904\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community is dealing with the situation in the Horn of Africa with particular reference to the alleviation of famine, violence and human rights issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>2017 saw a year of unprecedented humanitarian crises, including the reoccurrence of the threat of famine to the Horn of Africa, including South Sudan and Somalia. Ireland, in particular through EU and UN structures, continues to support efforts to address issues of famine, violence and human rights issues around the globe, including in the Horn of Africa.   The scale of the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa is very acute. Conflict, drought, severe food insecurity and now famine, are causing massive population displacements and suffering throughout the region.   Drought continues to worsen across the region.  Almost 30 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 24 million people facing varying levels of food insecurity. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to prioritize this region in its humanitarian response. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, has provided over &euro;132 million in humanitarian assistance in the Horn of Africa region since 2012, including &euro;28 million in 2017. Following his visit to the Horn of Africa in November, the T&aacute;naiste debriefed EU colleagues at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, on the critical humanitarian situation, and emphasised the importance of deepening the EU&rsquo;s political engagement with Africa in the future.<\/p>  <p>  A priority for Ireland in responding to humanitarian crises, is ensuring that life-saving assistance reaches those most in need, as quickly as possible. Ireland supports the role of OCHA in coordinating the response to humanitarian crises, and provides them with core funding (&euro;2.9 million in 2017) to facilitate their operation.  Ireland also supports the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which delivers funding quickly to humanitarian responders, including underfunded crises, aiming to ensure that competing demands do not mean crises are forgotten. In 2017, Ireland provided &euro;22 million to CERF making us the sixth largest donor that year. This UN managed fund has already contributed US$118 million to the region last year- almost 30% of the overall CERF 2017 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance where it is needed most, working with partners who can ensure that such assistance is delivered in a coordinated and effective manner. However, we also recognise that humanitarian aid alone is not the answer. We will continue to focus our efforts on supporting the international system to find peaceful resolution to conflicts that are currently driving humanitarian need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500055#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Multilateral Development Banks","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[3905\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the multilateral aid programme continues to reach those for whom it was intended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>The Government is strongly committed to delivering Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme in the most effective way, providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight against global poverty and hunger, including through working with multilateral partners.

In this way, we are playing a strong role in supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. <\/p><p>In total, Ireland contributed &euro;443.35 million to multilateral organisations in 2016. This was mainly channelled through: the European Union development cooperation and humanitarian programmes, for example the European Development Fund (EDF); the United Nations in the form of either core funding for UN agencies, or specific programmatic support, for example with UNICEF; and the multilateral development banks such as the World Bank - all important contributors to social and economic development, peace and security, and human rights.<\/p><p>Throughout, the ability of these multilateral channels to reach the poorest and most fragile countries and regions in the world, and deliver real results on the ground, is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s financing and engagement. <\/p><p>Programmes considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised using clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, cost effectiveness, accountability, and sustainability of intended impact.

Detailed planning leading to a results-based approach characterizes Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral aid programmes.  This enables the quality, effectiveness and efficiency to be kept under regular review by the Department.  The Embassy network, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, plays a key role in the planning, management and oversight of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral partners on the ground, frequently augmented by the insights received from other countries&rsquo; Embassies regarding their interaction with the same partners.     In addition to reporting against results, Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programmes are subject to regular monitoring and are frequently evaluated, both by the independent internal evaluation section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and also, as required, by external evaluators. The combination of ongoing qualitative and quantitative oversight helps ensure that Irish bilateral development assistance remains well targeted, contributing as effectively and efficiently as possible to the priorities of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign and international development policies. <\/p>  <p>  I witnessed first-hand the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral and multilateral support during my recent visits to Tanzania and South Africa.  I met with refugees who had fled conflict in Burundi and were hosted in a camp in western Tanzania managed by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).  I saw how Irish assistance was making a difference to their lives, in particular through the provision of water and education.  I also saw how Irish bilateral assistance was impacting positively on lives across the country, through targeted and effective interventions in the health system and in building a social safety net for the most vulnerable, in particularly women and girls at risk of violence. <\/p>  <p>  Irish assistance goes beyond money: I met, for example, a doctor in rural Tanzania who had trained in Ireland as an Irish Aid Fellow and who on his return home was sharing the knowledge and experiences gained here.  Ireland&rsquo;s work in the digital education space, in particular Africa Code Week, which I launched during my visit to Tanzania, reaches over 1.5 million people in Africa each year.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of Irish development assistance is reported on annually.  As demonstrated in the 2016 Irish Aid Annual report, bilateral ODA currently represents 53% of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA. This funding is making a difference in alleviating the suffering caused by humanitarian crises and hunger, and supporting improvements in access to health, education, agriculture and social protection services for some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. Ireland complements bilateral assistance through support for the multilateral system, allowing knowledge gained in bilateral contexts to inform and influence the international response, especially through the European Union and United Nations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation has a very strong reputation internationally for delivering results, consistently performing well in OECD-DAC peer reviews, which take place every 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent such review, in 2014, found Ireland to be one the best performing donors in responding to the world&rsquo;s neediest countries. That report demonstrated that in 2012, for example, 0.24% of Ireland&rsquo;s gross national income was as part of Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  This exceeds the UN target of 0.15%, and outperforms many other donors.  This focus on the most needy has continued, with the 2016 OECD DAC Development Cooperation Report ranking Ireland highest among DAC members for the share of bilateral ODA allocated to least developed countries.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the continued strengthening of our planning, monitoring and oversight mechanisms to ensure that Irish development assistance continues to effectively and efficiently deliver results, in particular the alleviation of poverty. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":147,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Membership","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[3908\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which candidate countries seeking to join the EU continue to adhere to the aquis communautaire; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[3910\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500056#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the EU continues to support and encourage democracy in the western Balkans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 62 together.<\/p><p>Ireland is a strong supporter of the EU&rsquo;s policy on enlargement.

In Somalia, the security situation remains extremely fragile.  Al-Shabaab continue to launch attacks on government facilities and civilians.  They remain a core threat to peace and stability in the country.  In the Lake Chad region, regional armed forces have made progress in containing Boko Haram but the group continue to represent a serious transboundary threat to peace, stability, and prosperity, with millions of people affected by violence and displacement.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU remain firm supporters of peace and stability in Somalia and the Lake Chad region.  The EU continues to provide considerable funding to AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to reduce the serious threat posed by Al-Shabaab.  The EU provides further support, as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy, to capacity building operations in the areas of maritime law enforcement and military training in order to strengthen rule of law in Somalia and boost the Somali security forces&rsquo; ability to combat the ongoing insurgency.  The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the 8,000 strong Multinational Joint Taskforce drawn from Nigeria and other West African countries, active against Boko Haram. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN level to prevent and counter terrorism. We have stressed the need to address the underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism.  Ireland sees an important link between peace, security and development, and this informs not just Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation approach but our broader foreign policy.<\/p>  <p>  The combined effects of the insurgencies of Al Shabaab and Boko Haram have contributed to severe humanitarian crises and mass displacement in Somalia and the Lake Chad region.

My officials have received representations on this topic, while there have also been a number of Parliamentary Questions tabled on the matter.<\/p><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles. <\/p><p>Policy in relation to the NCT lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The NCT was introduced to comply with an EU Roadworthiness Testing Directive aimed at improving road safety and environmental protection.  While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.  The NCT is an inspection or general &ldquo;health check&rdquo; of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features, amongst others, as lighting, brakes and tyres.<\/p><p>The NCT is a minimum requirement of roadworthiness and is therefore not the only rating factor taken into account in the provision of motor insurance.  Insurers will generally require that a car has a valid NCT in order to be covered.  However, in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will also use a combination of other rating factors, which include the age and type of the vehicle, as well as the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a vehicle and the availability of cover, different insurance companies will use different age thresholds.<\/p><p>Finally, it may be of interest to the Deputy that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance, and one of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and to &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.

Last year I put in place a structured process of engagement between my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a senior level \u00a0to address concerns highlighted by the Authority's assessment and to implement any necessary corrective action.

In this context, promoting access to and deepening existing trade relationships across a diversified portfolio of export markets is a key priority and this is made even more important in light of the potential impacts of Brexit.   Increased trade provides for stronger economic growth which creates employment and grows our economy.  Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by Enterprise Ireland, our policy objective is achieved through our support for the suite of EU Free Trade Agreements, and through multilateral agreements at WTO level, which both seek to deliver regulatory cooperation and reduced tariffs.  The EU suite of Free Trade Agreements with third countries helps to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  Brexit has reinforced the importance and the urgency of pursuing an ambitious programme of negotiations at EU level and Ireland fully supports the EU Commission's ambitious Free Trade Agreement agenda which seeks to accelerate the delivery of EU trade deals with leading economies and regional blocs.  <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access. CETA will present new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and Mexico hope to reach political agreement early this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement, to include provisions on regulatory cooperation, increased trade in agriculture and food, common sanitary standards and sustainable development. Ireland supports comparable trade conditions for investors and businesses across the Americas, making it easier for Irish businesses to trade in and enter these markets.  Negotiations with the Mercosur countries continues and political agreement was reached last year with Japan on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).  The EU\/Japan EPA has the potential to generate significant benefits for Ireland.  The agri-food sector, which is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, will see particular benefits, with improved access for beef and dairy products. The Agreement will also ensure tariff elimination on medical devices and pharmaceutical products which are manufactured in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, in his September 2017 State of the Union Address to the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  The draft negotiating mandates for Australia and New Zealand are currently being discussed by the Commission and Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements coupled with our programme of Minister led trade missions and bilateral visits overseas have provided a key foundation on which to further build our strong economic and trading links in export markets and this will continue.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore and Japan, the UAE and Oman, and a major trade programme as part of the Presidential State visit to Australia.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will also continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which we hope will be available later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500058#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500058#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[3852\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500058#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 617 of 11 October 2016, the available IDA lands at the end of quarter 4 2017; the occupied IDA lands at the end of quarter 4 of 2017, by county and town, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The availability of an\u00a0adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile foreign direct investment.\u00a0The availability of property solutions allows projects to commence at an earlier date by\u00a0diminishing much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.

It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child. Ireland&rsquo;s childhood immunisation programmes have had a huge impact in improving the health of the Irish population.  Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world such as polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and many other serious infectious diseases are now preventable by vaccination. <\/p>  <p>  Most people will get a HPV infection during their lifetime and most of these infections will not require further treatment.  However, in some women, HPV infections can cause changes in the cervix that can develop into cervical cancer. Every year in Ireland about 300 women get cervical cancer and 90 women will die from it.  Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 to 39 years of age.  Worldwide cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women.  In 2012 there were over 500,000 new cases and over 250,000 deaths.  <\/p>  <p>  The HPV vaccine protects against certain HPV types which causes 7 out of 10 cervical cancers.  Therefore most cervical cancers can be prevented by the vaccine.  This is the message that we want parents to hear.  Although HPV covers 7 out of 10 cervical cancers it is still very important for women to have regular smear tests to detect cancers caused by HPV types not covered by the vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  Unfounded claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women - there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  The misinformation concerning the HPV vaccine appears to be having an impact - uptake rates have fallen from 87% in 2014\/15 to 51% in 2016\/17.  The Irish Cancer Society state, that based on national cancer statistics the drop in the rate of uptake to 50% for the 2016-2017 academic year, will have the following consequences:<\/p>  <p>  - The death of at least 40 girls  with cervical cancer who did not receive the HPV vaccine<\/p>  <p>  - A further 100 girls will develop cervical cancer and will require life altering treatment and,<\/p>  <p>  - An additional 1000 girls will require invasive therapy to prevent the precancerous form of HPV. <\/p>  <p>  I would urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with your family doctor, or alternatively to visit the HPV website &ndash; www.hpv.ie. These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500059#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500059#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[3758\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500059#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the ethical rationale and legal basis for the recurring levying of a day inpatient charge for ongoing venesection treatments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that all people ordinarily resident in the country are entitled, subject to certain charges, to public in-patient hospital services, including consultant services, and to public out-patient hospital services.

The BSSD is an essential piece of legislation which protects the public, patients, workers and others from all forms of ionising radiation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health conducted a general consultation on the BSSD in June 2017 and sought views on the provisions of the Directive where Member States had discretion.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at<i><i><\/i><\/i>.<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

The Council agreed its general approach last summer &ndash; supported by Ireland- while the Parliament only concluded its deliberations last week.\u00a0<\/p><p>Over the coming weeks and perhaps months, negotiations will take place between the two institutions on this very complex proposal.<\/p><p>We are\u00a0analysing the EU Parliament amendments with a view to making\u00a0clear\u00a0the issues of concern and the elements that we can support.\u00a0<\/p><p>My officials and I are working, in close consultation with industry stakeholders, to try\u00a0to ensure that any final agreement is practicable, sensible and will facilitate rather than hinder the industry in reaching our common objective of sustainable and profitable fisheries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500061#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sea Lice Controls","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500061#WRH05800"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[3880\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500061#WRH05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the systems in place to address the threat of sea lice to wild salmon on farms.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>In Ireland the control of sea lice is managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State.\u00a0 These protocols are more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:<\/p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.<\/p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspection is published and made widely available.<\/p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.<\/p><p>The sea lice monitoring and control programme in Ireland has been acknowledged by the Environment Directorate (DG Environment) of the EU Commission as representing international best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500061#WRH06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Marketing Programme","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500062#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[3881\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500062#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department or Bord Bia has analysed marketing regarding nomadic meat in the UK; and the policy options to progress this issue and increase live exports.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>The labelling of food in the European Union is governed by a number of regulations which lay down strict requirements in relation to mandatory country of origin labelling\u00a0for certain meats. <\/p>  <p>  Under these rules, labels on meat from cattle born and reared in the Republic of Ireland, exported live to Northern Ireland\u00a0and subsequently slaughtered there must include the member state of birth and rearing and the member state of slaughter.

For the first time, this has given the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.

This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for an Invalidity Pension from the Department, a self-employed person or employee must have 260 PRSI paid contributions (Class A, E, H or S) since they started paying social insurance and 48 PRSI paid or credited contributions (Class A, E, H or S) in the last complete contribution year or the second last contribution year before the date of their claim.

Following this transition period, the 2017 referral numbers are maintaining a maximum case load of 120 to each case officer.<\/p><p>The table lists the total new registrations for each County for 2016 and 2017.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>New Registrations (attended) All Clients<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>529<\/td><td>1162<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>10332<\/td><td>9812<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>282<\/td><td>431<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>814<\/td><td>1005<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>1114<\/td><td>1469<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>672<\/td><td>1403<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>915<\/td><td>1268<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>632<\/td><td>501<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>505<\/td><td>368<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>327<\/td><td>1343<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>447<\/td><td>1255<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>135<\/td><td>528<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>16704<\/td><td>20545<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Data","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[3824\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the amount paid to Jobpath providers in 2017.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[3825\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons referred to Jobpath since its commencement; the number that gained full-time and part-time employment as a direct result of Jobpath; and the sectors in which employment was gained.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[3826\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons that have been released from Jobpath having not gained employment since its commencement.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[3829\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons engaged in Jobpath since its commencement that have had their jobseeker's payment either reduced or suspended.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[3830\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012500063#WRK04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of Turas Nua and Seetec offices here; the year each office began providing the Jobpath service; and the corresponding number of times each office has been inspected since jobpath commenced.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 212, inclusive,, 215 and 216 together.<\/p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid on the basis of performance and with the exception of the initial registration fee; payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  The overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs. <\/p><p>It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts currently in place and in any future procurement that may be undertaken.<\/p><p>The total of fees claimed by the JobPath providers in 2017 was &euro;58.5m.<\/p><p>JobPath has been designed to support persons who are long term unemployed and at the end of December 2017 some 141,000 jobseekers have commenced engagement with the service. Of these 52% were unemployed for more than three years and a further 12% have been unemployed for more than two years.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of participants to find employment and the number to complete their engagement period with the service without finding employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months. During this time they have access to a Personal Advisor (PA) who works with them over two phases.  In the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work and the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to these two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while on JobPath and this may extend the period for up to a further 6 months.<\/p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available. <\/p><p>The Department has published initial cohort reports on the performance of the service, the most recent of which was published on the 5th of January 2018 and is available on the department's website welfare.ie. at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This initial report, which is based on the first four cohorts of jobseekers to be referred only, indicates that of these Jobseekers, to date 18% have entered full time employment, 4% entered part time employment and 3% became self-employed, giving a total employment outcome figure of 25%.  In addition, the report noted that participants have a higher chance of securing and remaining in employment compared to non-participants with a similar duration of unemployment.<\/p><p>An initial analysis of the sectors in which participants found employment suggests that some of the most popular types of employment are within the construction, manufacturing, sales, clerical\/administrative, food service, cleaning and customer service sectors. <\/p><p>Given the above, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services, completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of Q3, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2017, circa 93,000 clients were engaged with JobPath, of which 483 or 0.5% have a penalty rate applied to their claim. This figure is consistent with the overall level of penalty rates applied across all Job Seekers.  In total since the JobPath service commenced,  approximately 6,500 or 4.6% of the 141,000 clients who had engaged with the JobPath service (between July 2015 and December 2017) have had, at some point during their engagement period, a penalty rate applied to their payment.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that JobPath providers do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate.  They simply advise the Department if a jobseeker is failing to attend activation meetings.  Officials in the Department then contact the Jobseeker and seek to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter directly with them.  The application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for the Department and officials involved will take all relevant factors into account.<\/p><p>In the interests of natural justice, a jobseeker who fails to participate in the activation process, whether that is provided directly by the Intreo service or via any contracted service provider, is given both written and verbal warnings and an opportunity to comply before a reduced rate of payment is applied.  Furthermore, Jobseekers can, through co-operation with the activation service of my Department, benefit from early re-instatement of the full rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Jobseekers can also appeal the decision to apply a penalty rate through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).<\/p><p>The JobPath Agreements were signed with Turas Nua and Seetec on <b>5 June 2015<\/b>.  The service is being delivered in two contract areas which were based on the Department&rsquo;s divisional structure.  The contract areas are as follows:<\/p><p>- Seetec - West; Midlands North; North East; North West, Dublin Central; Dublin North; Dublin South.<\/p><p>- Turas Nua - Cork Central; South East; Mid-Leinster, Mid-West; South West; Midlands South.<\/p><p>The roll-out of the service commenced on <b>20 July 2015 <\/b>on a &ldquo;soft-launch&rdquo; basis and completed in mid- 2016.

Further details on the suite of initiatives announced earlier this week can be found at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>With regard to the new Affordable Purchase Scheme, the purpose of which is to enable eligible households to acquire a home of their own, supported by and in partnership with the State, these homes will be built initially on local authority land. <\/p><p>The scheme will be governed on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which will be commenced shortly.  Once the relevant provisions are commenced, I will develop, in consultation with the Housing Agency and local authorities, detailed Regulations covering the operation of the Scheme, including eligibility criteria.  Based on the agreed criteria, the elected members of each local authority are then responsible for determining the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households, in relation to the sale of affordable dwellings.<\/p><p>Once the regulatory framework is in place, local authorities will have more options for the development of their land bank for affordable housing.  Currently, Dublin City Council has three major ready-to-go sites being advanced through procurement.  The elected members of the City Council have determined that 20% of the homes on these sites - at Infirmary Road, Emmett Road, and Oscar Traynor Road - will be affordable.<\/p><p>I anticipate that there is significant potential for the delivery of affordable homes on local authority lands.  Following on from the Housing Summit on 22 January, I have asked local authority Chief Executives to submit, by mid-February, an outline of their respective affordable housing programmes, with a particular emphasis on Dublin, Galway, and Cork, where there is the greatest affordability gap.<\/p><p>Finally, with regard to households who do not meet income eligibility criteria for the new Affordable Purchase Scheme, the Help-to-Buy initiative which was retained in Budget 2018 should help alleviate some of the specific challenges faced by those first-time buyers in accessing the housing market.

local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan,\u00a0I am introducing from 1 February 2018\u00a0a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.\u00a0 The new loan\u00a0will enable credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have\u00a0been able to afford at a higher interest rate. Full details of the\u00a0loan's eligibility criteria\u00a0and other information is available from the dedicated\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website,<i><i><\/i><\/i>.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is targeted at first time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home.\u00a0 As with\u00a0 the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding\u00a0Ireland Home Loan is\u00a0available to first time buyers only.\u00a0\u00a0This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.\u00a0 The option currently available\u00a0for non-first time buyers\u00a0is to seek home loan facilities from one of the commercial lending institutions.<\/p><p>The Housing Finance Agency (HFA)\u00a0has raised &euro;200 million on a fixed rate basis for periods out to thirty years maturity. Based on the pricing achieved, local authorities can offer a first tranche of fixed rate annuity finance to eligible borrowers at rates of 2.0% and 2.25% per annum, for twenty five and thirty years respectively, up to an aggregate maximum of &euro;200 million. The funding will be drawn down by local authorities from the HFA to match fund their lending under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.
