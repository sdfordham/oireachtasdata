A range of initiatives are currently underway, including public awareness campaigns, tenancy protection services, the HAP Homeless Pilot, prioritised allocations and targeted acquisitions which are aimed at mitigating entry into homelessness and reducing the need for hotels for emergency accommodation.

This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,660 rent supplement households nationwide, of which 63 cases are in place in Meath, to retain their rented accommodation through the payment of increased rent supplement. A breakdown of these awards by month and locality is not readily available. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP is currently in operation in 13 local authority areas in which there are approximately 2,700 HAP tenancies already in place. The financial provision for rent supplement for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support HAP. Estimates on savings to this Department in future years would be based on the numbers of customers in receipt of rent supplement and the progress of the roll out of HAP.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement: Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2008 to Present<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>74,038<\/td><td>440,548<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>93,030<\/td><td>510,751<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010 <\/td><td>97,260<\/td><td>516,538<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>96,803<\/td><td>502,747 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>87,684<\/td><td>422,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>71,533<\/td><td>338,347 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>67,016 <\/td><td>298,415 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Rent Supplement Recipients by County End of 2011-2015<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>June 2015 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>34,423<\/td><td>32,584<\/td><td>29,541<\/td><td>26,453<\/td><td>25,169<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>10,732<\/td><td>9,878<\/td><td>9,020<\/td><td>8,273<\/td><td>7,625<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>4,447<\/td><td>4,338<\/td><td>4,135<\/td><td>3,698<\/td><td>3,569<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>4,615<\/td><td>4,134<\/td><td>3,983<\/td><td>3,591<\/td><td>3,476<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>4,102<\/td><td>3,700<\/td><td>3,179<\/td><td>2,700<\/td><td>2,495<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>3,833<\/td><td>3,323<\/td><td>2,984<\/td><td>2,461<\/td><td>1,934<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>2,734<\/td><td>2,549<\/td><td>2,422<\/td><td>2,211<\/td><td>1,854<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>2,719<\/td><td>2,495<\/td><td>2,381<\/td><td>2,130<\/td><td>2,049<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>2,609<\/td><td>2,199<\/td><td>2,094<\/td><td>1,961<\/td><td>1,914<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>2,977<\/td><td>2,411<\/td><td>2,047<\/td><td>1,812<\/td><td>1,651<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>2,723<\/td><td>2,143<\/td><td>1,941<\/td><td>1,726<\/td><td>1,619<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>2,278<\/td><td>2,037<\/td><td>1,888<\/td><td>1,736<\/td><td>1,659<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>2,928<\/td><td>2,435<\/td><td>1,900<\/td><td>1,619<\/td><td>1,606<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>1,671<\/td><td>1,592<\/td><td>1,588<\/td><td>1,533<\/td><td>1,484<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>2,098<\/td><td>1,773<\/td><td>1,556<\/td><td>1,443<\/td><td>1,238<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>1,961<\/td><td>1,722<\/td><td>1,547<\/td><td>1,336<\/td><td>1,286<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>1,619<\/td><td>1,365<\/td><td>1,210<\/td><td>1,011<\/td><td>745<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>1,440<\/td><td>1,239<\/td><td>1,108<\/td><td>1,086<\/td><td>1,070<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>1,349<\/td><td>1,240<\/td><td>1,124<\/td><td>1,041<\/td><td>961<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>1,178<\/td><td>1,097<\/td><td>1,085<\/td><td>1,008<\/td><td>988<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>1,275<\/td><td>997<\/td><td>802<\/td><td>687<\/td><td>665<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>623<\/td><td>511<\/td><td>507<\/td><td>476<\/td><td>421<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>698<\/td><td>591<\/td><td>542<\/td><td>451<\/td><td>486<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>843<\/td><td>519<\/td><td>455<\/td><td>414<\/td><td>419<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>488<\/td><td>438<\/td><td>395<\/td><td>352<\/td><td>306<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>440<\/td><td>374<\/td><td>354<\/td><td>324<\/td><td>327<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>96,803<\/td><td>87,684<\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>71,533<\/td><td>67,016<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600055#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Eligibility","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600055#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[29700\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600055#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on extending eligibility for the domiciliary care allowance to persons aged under 18 years of age.","asker":"1195","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I commissioned two reports relating to the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) scheme during 2012.

The original scheme was introduced in 1970 and was extended to include self-employed mothers with effect from June 1997.  This year it is estimated that there will be a weekly average of 24,000 recipients of Maternity Benefit at a cost of &euro;254 million.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for Maternity Benefit a woman must be in insurable employment or self-employment and is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  <\/p>  <p>  In order for an employee to qualify for Maternity Benefit a woman must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12 months before the first day of her maternity leave; or have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the Relevant Tax Year or in the year following the Relevant Tax Year; or have at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Relevant Tax Year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Tax Year prior to the Relevant Tax Year.<\/p>  <p>  For a person in self-employment, she must have sufficient earnings (&euro;5,000 per annum) in the year of her confinement to be liable to pay income tax and PRSI.  In addition to being in insurable self-employment the woman must also satisfy one of the following PRSI contribution conditions:<\/p>  <p>  i. have 52 qualifying PRSI conditions paid in the relevant tax year or<\/p>  <p>  ii. have 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year prior to the relevant tax year or<\/p>  <p>  iii. have 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year following the relevant tax year.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employment contributions, Class S PRSI, are not awarded for any particular year until all liabilities for that year are paid.  Where a woman has recently set up as a self-employed person or historically has earnings from self-employment below the &euro;5,000 threshold, it may not be possible to qualify for her payment until such time as her reckonable income and Class S liability for the year in question can confirmed.  In such instances the Department can review the insurable status for the woman after she files her tax return to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for the year in question.  In cases where the Department finds that a self-employed customer has a record of earnings in excess of &euro;5,000 in previous years and has an expected due date early in the tax year (i.e. within the first 16 weeks), her earnings in the previous year, if greater than &euro;5,000, can be used as confirmation of her insurable status.  All applications for maternity benefit from self-employed women are processed on a case by case basis and every effort is made to qualify the customer for payment where possible and in accordance with legislative provisions.  <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for Maternity Benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment provided they meet the relevant contingency conditions.  For instance, new mothers who do not qualify for Maternity Benefit may be eligible for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  This scheme is considered a \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system for eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600056#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600056#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[29966\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600056#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied).","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 15 April 2015.

A control strategy has been adopted and operated by the Department which includes risk assessment, surveys of the levels of fraud and error, scheme specific review policies, data matching initiatives with both external and internal parties and investigation of anonymous reports.<\/p>  <p>  A policy of issuing continuing eligibility certificates to parents commenced in 2008 and is still in operation. The child benefit control programme is kept under regular review based on the outcomes achieved.  The continuing eligibility certificate programme forms part of the overall child benefit control programme and is included and described in the control policy for the scheme.  The control policy is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that controls in place to prevent fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant.<\/p>  <p>The Department undertook approximately 400,000 continuing eligibility reviews of child benefit EFT customers in 2014, representing some two thirds of all child benefit customers. This control activity generated some &euro;70 million in savings in respect of expenditure that would otherwise have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  During 2013 and 2014, the number of child benefit claims stopped as a result of the continuing eligibility reviews was 8,500.

Two certificates will issue to all customers, including Irish, who are paid or part paid child benefit in Ireland on the basis of their continued employment within the EU.  It is not proposed to issue continuing eligibility certificates to customers paid at their local post office, representing some 168,000 customers, during 2015 as these confirm their identity and ongoing eligibility when collecting payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600057#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Applications","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600057#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[29980\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600057#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who wishes to avail of the back to work enterprise scheme; how this can be progressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>The client has been working with an Enterprise Officer with Kildare County Leader Partnership since April 2014, in order to develop a business plan.

The full range of online services which are currently available to customers is available on the &lsquo;Online Services and Forms&rsquo; tab on my Department&rsquo;s website .<\/p><p>My Department is focused on modernising its service delivery platform and developing systems to support new functions, and is committed to delivering on the objectives of the Public Sector ICT Strategy including the strategic objective of digitisation of key transactional services, increased use of ICT to deliver improved efficiency, and the provision of new digital services to citizens, businesses and public servants.<\/p><p>System development projects are in the main carried out as part of business process improvement projects and this includes identifying elements suitable for online services and eGovernment solutions. Many of the Department&rsquo;s short term schemes such as supplementary welfare allowance may require the Department to engage directly with the customer face-to-face.  Similarly, in schemes such as jobseekers allowance and illness benefit, certification requirements can involve more complexity and engagement with 3rd party entities.  It is also very often the case that implementing data sharing and data exchange mechanisms with other government departments and offices can provide significant benefits in this regard and this is reflected in the Department&rsquo;s strategy.<\/p><p>In 2014, the Department carried out an assessment of key transactional services and a programme of work commenced to develop new solutions for jobseekers.  This programme includes the development of online services, an online identity and access management service and integration with Departmental IT systems.  These new online services will be made available in phased releases beginning in 2015 and will initially include an online appointment service for public service card registration, online jobseeker application and close my claim service, and a facility to make appointments with case officers and deciding officers.<\/p><p>The statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection are the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Authority, the Pensions Council, the Pensions Ombudsman and the Social Welfare Tribunal. The Citizens Information Board does not process applications from members of the public.

The matter\u00a0was heard by Mr Justice Hedigan on 13th\/14th July 2015.\u00a0There are no indications yet as to when the outcome of the case can\u00a0be expected. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank will in due course be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.\u00a0 However, since Setanta\u00a0is a Maltese\u00a0authorised company subject to prudential supervision\u00a0by the Malta Financial Services Authority, any follow-up investigation on the regulatory issues surrounding the firm's failure falls under the responsibility of the MFSA as home regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600059#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600059#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[29615\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600059#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, from the records of the Revenue Commissioners, for each of the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to 2013, the number of income earners; the average total income of the top 0.1%; the next 0.9%; the next 4%; the next 5% earners; the next 40%; and the next 50% of earners.

Each member is assigned a Quota, broadly based on its size relative to the world economy.  A member's Quota determines its maximum financial commitment to the IMF, as well as its voting power, and has a bearing on its access to IMF financing.  Quotas are denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the IMF's unit of account.  This is based on a weighted mix of the following major world currencies: US Dollars, Euro, Japanese Yen and the UK Pound Sterling.  Ireland's IMF quota is currently SDR 1,257.6 million, or 0.528% of the total Quota share of the IMF.  This has been the case since 4 March, 2011, when the 2008 Quota Review came into force.  At 31 December, 2014, the amount of SDR 1,257.6 million was made up of SDR 998,897,520 held in Ireland's IMF General Resources Account and a further SDR 258,702,480 which is held in Ireland's Reserve Tranche Position at the IMF.  In addition to Quota, Ireland has committed other funding via a separate process to the IMF known as SDR holdings.  SDR holdings were put in place by agreement of the members of the IMF predominantly in order to ensure that the IMF had sufficient resources to tackle the recent Global Financial Crisis.

The endorsement process will begin soon after the publication of Q2 National Accounts data by the CSO in September.  The timelines for this process are laid out in a Memorandum of Understanding between the Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance, which are available on both websites.  Based on these macroeconomic projections, my Department will produce the fiscal and budgetary forecasts, taking into account the end-September Exchequer returns and any policy decisions made as part of Budget 2016. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In advance of each Budget, normally the Friday before publication, the White Paper on the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure is published.

The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.  My overall objective in relation to the State's investment in the banks is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer over time. <\/p>  <p>  In line with this objective my Department is working with AIB, the institution where &euro;20.8 billion has been invested, on reconfiguring the capital structure and looking at a range of options available to recoup value from the bank.  I have appointed Goldman Sachs International from our panel of financial advisers to provide financial advice in this regard.  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time.  While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or indeed to put a timeline on decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Bank of Ireland, the Deputy will be aware that we have already made a net positive cash return from our investment in, and support for, the bank.  In addition, we continue to hold a valuable equity stake in BOI which, at the current share price, is worth c. &euro;1.7 billion.  Lastly in relation to ptsb, the situation there is that the company has recently completed a &euro;525 million capital raise from private investors, this comprised of &euro;400 million equity and &euro;125 million AT1 (debt instrument).  As part of the transaction the State sold &euro;98 million worth of shares to enable the Company to meet the 25% Free Float requirements of the Irish and London stock exchanges.  As a result of the Capital Raise, the State's holding has been diluted from 99.2% to 74.9% leaving the state with a valuable equity investment of circa &euro;1.6 billion.

VAT on these services is now chargeable where the consumer is located instead of where the supplier is located.  This ensures that the VAT goes to the Member State in which the services are used.  The estimate of &euro;100 million in respect of these changes was based \u00a0on two specific and immediate VAT inflows into the Irish Exchequer directly resulting from the new rules.  The 1st element was the VAT revenue shifting from Luxembourg in respect of services bought by Irish consumers from Luxembourg-based suppliers.  The 2nd was VAT revenue shifting from the UK Exchequer in respect of TV broadcasting services currently provided from the UK to Irish consumers.  The estimate of &euro;100 million was a combination of these two elements and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that these projections were very accurate.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is a very welcome additional source of revenue that we were unable to estimate at the time.  As a result of the change, businesses are required to register and account for VAT in every Member State in which they supply such services to consumers or, alternatively, to avail of the optional special scheme known as the Mini\u00a0 One Stop Shop (MOSS).  The MOSS scheme is a simplification scheme which allows a business engaged in those supplies to register in a single Member State, to file a single quarterly return and pay its VAT liability for all Member States through a web portal in the Member State of registration.  The return details and payments are transferred by the Member State of registration to the relevant Member States of consumption with the Member State of registration retaining a percentage of the VAT collected.

Returns for each year are due by 15 January of the following year and the total value of DIRT due and paid is reported to Revenue on the January returns at institutional level.  Sufficiently detailed figures are not required in these returns to identify the numbers of accounts on which DIRT was paid, the average DIRT payment per account or the tax forgone resulting from DIRT exemptions.<\/p><p>However, the Deputy may be interested to note that, separately, under regulations as provided for in Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, certain financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, are required to make automatic annual returns at account level electronically to Revenue.  The primary purpose of this Section is to provide information for use in risk analysis by Revenue and therefore the requirement to report interest focuses on account holders in receipt of larger payments. <\/p><p>The information under S891B is provided where the payment of interest is greater than &euro;635 in a year and in all instances of a first interest payment on newly opened accounts irrespective of amount.

It is important to note the information received under Section 891B is not limited to individuals but also includes interest payments on accounts held by corporations and other entities.  It should also be noted that the reporting threshold was reduced from &euro;635 to &euro;300 from 2014 onwards.

The total value of interest paid to these accounts for 2011, 2012, 2013 &amp;amp; 2014 is &euro;2.42 billion, &euro;2.10 billion, &euro;1.97 billion and &euro;1.38 billion respectively.

Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed, except to purchase an annuity, until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. <\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. \u00a0In this context, it would be unusual for the capital in an AMRF to both make the scale of the annual gains set out in the details supplied with the question while also paying out those gains each year.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a drawdown of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Based on the details supplied, the AMRF owner would also have the option of using part of the AMRF funds to purchase a small pension annuity equal to the difference between the State pension in payment to her and the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, thereby allowing the conversion of the remaining AMRF funds into an ARF, giving full access to the funds, subject to taxation.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I consider that the change to the access arrangements for AMRFs will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, and I have no plans to reverse it at this time. I will, however, bear in mind the circumstances of this case in considering the detail of the ARF option which, in common with other matters, will be reviewed as part of the preparations for the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[29905\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the handling by the Revenue Commissioners of super levy fines imposed on farmers in 2015; if these fines can be set-off against the farmers' income in their accounts this year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that payments made by dairy farmers in respect of milk quota super levy (under SI 227 of 2008, as amended and Council Regulation EC 1234\/2007, as amended) are classified as an expense of the trade.\u00a0 As such, the super levy is tax deductible in the year in which the expense is recognised in the farmer's accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[29946\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the capital acquisitions tax thresholds; his plans to increase the thresholds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[30089\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the caps and thresholds of the capital acquisition tax system given the increase in property prices which means that family members can now incur significant tax bills if they wish to retain their original family home in the family when it is not their principal private residence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 199 together.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been raised with me by Deputies and others in recent months and I am conscious of the concerns involved. <\/p>  <p>  Capital Acquisitions Tax applies to the beneficiary of a gift or inheritance rather than to the person making the gift or inheritance. While the rate of CAT is 33% each person has a number of life-time thresholds for gifts and inheritances which they can receive tax free. These are based on the relationship to the person who has made the gift or bequest.<\/p>  <p>  The Group A threshold of &euro;225,000 applies primarily in cases where an asset passes from a parent to a child. The Group B threshold of &euro;30,150 applies primarily to transfers between other close relatives. The Group C threshold of &euro;15,075 applies between more distant relations and people who are not related. <\/p>  <p>  The 33% rate of CAT applies on assets received by a person above the relevant threshold. Gifts and inheritances between spouses and civil partners are exempt from CAT.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of years the CAT thresholds have been reduced a number of times, while the rate has been increased. These changes were necessary in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in a period of falling asset prices so that such taxes would continue to make a contribution to our efforts to consolidate the public finances. Moreover, the views of the OECD, supported by our own economic research, is that taxes on property and other fixed capital, such as CAT, are less harmful and distortionary to economic growth than taxes on work or consumption. As the economic recovery continues to take hold, I began this year to focus available resources on reducing the burden of taxation on earned income and take-home pay where high taxes impact on competitiveness, economic growth and job creation. That will continue to be my main focus.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I do recognise that recent growth in property values has implications for the liabilities that can arise from capital acquisitions tax. It is for this reason that, as I have said in response to a number of other recent Parliamentary Questions on this matter, I am reviewing the various aspects of this tax in the context of the preparations for Budget 2016 and the subsequent Finance Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[29952\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600063#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to reduce the rate of deposit interest retention tax which penalises savers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is\u00a0standard practice for the Minister for Finance to review all tax expenditures and reliefs in the run up to annual Budgets.

The extent of the illegal trade in cigarettes is estimated, however, through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for\u00a0the Revenue Commissioners and for the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes, the results of the 2014 survey indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT attributable to the illegal trade was in the order of &euro;210 million.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners also advise me that, while there is no reliable estimate of the extent of illegal activity in the fuel sector, they recognise that fuel fraud, including the laundering of markers from rebated fuel, is a significant threat to Exchequer revenues. Action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a priority for Revenue, which is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem. Key elements of this strategy include the following:<\/p><p>- The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.<\/p><p>- A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.<\/p><p>- New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.<\/p><p>- Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue. These data are being used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary.<\/p><p>- The introduction from the start of April 2015 of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK. The work of Revenue officers in testing fuel for the presence of the new marker will be supported by mobile equipment that will allow on the spot analysis of samples.<\/p><p>- The introduction of the necessary legislative provisions required to underpin these important initiatives, as well as measures designed to strengthen Revenue's hand in combatting fuel criminality.\u00a0 The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that a supplier who is reckless in supplying fuel for a use connected with excise fraud will be liable for duty at the standard rate of tax, and represents a significant disincentive to such activity. In the Finance Act 2014, measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence, where the trader does nor comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information, were put in place.<\/p><p>I am assured by Revenue that they are very conscious of the threats posed by all forms of smuggling and by criminality in the fuel sector, and that action against all such forms of illegal activity is, and will continue to be, a central element of their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600064#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Petrol Stretching","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600064#WRM02400"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[30264\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600064#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 6 of 1 April 2015, the progress to date on the issue of petrol stretching and contamination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they fully recognise the serious threats that fuel fraud poses to legitimate businesses, motorists and to Exchequer returns.

The conclusive results received from those tests led to the seizure of the product. A case is currently before the Courts in relation to one of these detections and a file is being prepared with a view to prosecution in the case of the 2nd detection. The focus of Revenue's control and compliance actions at a particular point depends on the nature of the issue being addressed. In the case of reported problems with petrol quality, and the suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching, the priority has been to check out petrol stations about which a complaint was received. I am advised that the Revenue is satisfied that this represents the best use of the investigative resources available to them in addressing this particular matter. I have been advised by the Revenue that the number of complaints received by them have decreased significantly from a peak of 104 in the months September to November 2014 to 13 in the first quarter of 2015.

The AFAs were selected following a national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment in 2011.  Under the CFRAM Programme, detailed flood mapping is being produced in order to identify and map the existing and potential future flood hazards and risks in each AFA following which Flood Risk Management Plans will be prepared and published.  <\/p>  <p>  The investigation of localised flooding problems is a matter for local authorities in the first instance.  It is open to local authorities to undertake flood mitigation works using their own resources.  It is also open to local authorities to submit an application for funding for mitigation measures under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The Scheme applies to small scale non maintenance type  projects estimated to cost no more than &euro;500,000 in each instance, and where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  The commencement and progression of approved projects are a matter for the local authority concerned. <\/p>  <p>  To date funding of over &euro;30m has been allocated to 33 city and county councils for over 450 flood mitigation and coastal protection projects throughout the country.  Of the total funding allocated under the Scheme, to date the OPW has allocated out over &euro;25m to local authorities for projects, which have provided protection to a significant number of residential and commercial properties.<\/p>  <p>  OPW has been allocated a total of &euro;225m for Flood Risk Management for the period 2012 - 2016.  In the period 2011-2014, OPW expended over &euro;175m on Flood Risk Management.

Ongoing priorities include more online delivery of services and improved engagement with service users; implementation of shared services and alternative models of service delivery; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; and increased accountability and transparency in public decision making.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Turning to renewal of the civil service, following the successful delivery of the 'first 200 days' milestone last week, my Department is also playing a leading role in implementing the remaining actions and achieving the ambitious programme of change in the Civil Service Renewal Plan.\u00a0 This represents a major programme to support the future development and enhance the capacity of the Civil Service to ensure that it provides a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Reform of procurement across public service and the development of the Office of Government Procurement remains a priority. Procurement of supplies and services represents a very significant portion of overall Government spending.\u00a0 The Office of Government Procurement is tasked with delivering the Procurement Reform Programme enabling the public service to achieve economies of scale and maximum value for money in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Shared Services is a key element of the Public Service Reform Plan and remains a core priority for my Department.\u00a0 The National Shared Services Office in my Department is directly responsible for Shared Service delivery and strategy in the Civil Service.\u00a0 It also supports other Public Service sectors as they implement Shared Services.\u00a0 Transitions to the Civil Service HR and Pensions Administration Shared Service Centre (PeoplePoint) and the Payroll Shared Service Centre (PSSC) will continue as a priority during 2016.\u00a0\u00a0When fully operational, PeoplePoint will service 31,500 public service employees and the PSSC will support 120,000 payees. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2015, I launched the Public Service ICT Strategy - \"Delivering better outcomes and efficiency through innovation and excellence in ICT\".  Building on the successful delivery of many existing services, the Strategy sets out how we can operate in a more efficient, shared and integrated manner across all of Government while delivering new and innovative digital services to citizens and businesses. Innovative use of ICT in the Public Service will deliver better value for taxpayers by creating efficiencies through integration, consolidation and sharing of common infrastructure, systems and resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Strategy sets out five key strategic objectives which are setting the future direction for innovation and excellence in ICT in Public Service.\u00a0 In parallel with developing a Strategic Implementation Plan, my Department is continuing to work with Departments to prioritise projects which support the transformation, modernisation and digitisation of the main citizen and business transactional services across the Public Service. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I will also continue to work towards protecting and enhancing peace in Northern Ireland and will continue to develop the North-South institutions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above high level priorities, I intend to continue to progress the other relevant commitments under the Programme for Government for which my Department is responsible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600066#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600066#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[29607\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600066#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount paid in 2013 and 2014 and in 2015 to date, and the plans for future payments, under the national lottery good causes fund, in respect of the natural environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

the implementation of the Civil Service Renewal Plan; funding for the Benefacts partnership initiative (formerly The Irish NonProfits Project\/INKEx); and support for External Service Delivery and Shared Services projects.\u00a0 It is also being used to support other reform related initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership.<\/p><p>Separately, in January 2015, the Government approved the Public Service ICT Strategy - &quot;Delivering better outcomes and efficiency through innovation and excellence in ICT&quot;.\u00a0\u00a0Building on the successful delivery of many existing services, the Strategy sets out how we can operate in a more efficient, shared and integrated manner across all of Government while delivering new and innovative digital services to citizens and businesses. Innovative use of ICT in the Public Service will deliver better value for taxpayers by creating efficiencies through integration, consolidation and sharing of common infrastructure, systems and resources.<\/p><p>The strategy has five key strategic objectives that will set the future direction for innovation and excellence in ICT in Public Service.\u00a0 A Strategic Implementation Plan is currently being developed and will include business cases for future investment in a number of strategic initiatives.<\/p><p>An amount of &euro;39,033,000 has been allocated within my Department for the National Shared Services Office Vote for 2015. This funding is being used to support the establishment of Shared Services within the Civil Service which is a key innovation initiative in the delivery of Public Service Reform and Civil Service Renewal. Shared services is a recognised model globally for consolidating transactional functions, such as Finance, Payroll, and Human Resources, that improves business performance and drives value through the provision of shared transactional services by an independent service provider to a number of organisations that were previously carried out by each organisation separately. Shared Services improve efficiencies and control by freeing up resources to focus on their core business and eliminating duplication of effort, enabling quicker access to data and improved data quality through process standardisation, specialisation, and technology automation. <\/p><p>Within the Civil Service the introduction of shared services is an important part of the Government's reform programme. The new shared services office began providing HR and Pensions Administration Shared Services to the Civil Service on a phased basis in March 2013 and is continuing to roll this out to other Public Service Bodies throughout this year. The Payroll Shared Service Centre began transacting in December 2013 and this will become fully operational by 2017. There is also a project underway to develop a Financial Management Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service, expected to be operational in 2017. <\/p><p>The Procurement Reform Programme and the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is one of the key government reform programmes designed to achieve significant benefits including savings in public expenditure. The new procurement arrangements will deliver significant benefits to the State by transforming the existing fragmented procurement model to a centre-led structure, underpinned by common policies, processes and systems. The net funding allocation for the Office of Government Procurement in 2015 is estimated at &euro;18.974m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600067#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600067#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[30145\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600067#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his Department or agencies under the authority of his Department have performed an assessment of the potential savings to be accrued if current paper-based application processes by members of the public were replaced with a fully online application system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":707,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware my Department does not have any paper based application processes for members of the public however we are taking major strides towards a paperless working environment.\u00a0 We introduced a system for the electronic processing of PQs which has reduced the huge amount of paper associated with this process.\u00a0 This is complemented by an esubmissions system.\u00a0 The implementation of an electronic records management system, eDocs, is currently underway.\u00a0 This system will address the challenges of enabling the department to manage files and documents more effectively removing paper from the process where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in January 2014.\u00a0 This plan places a particular focus on improving service delivery.\u00a0 This is being implemented in a number of ways including more digital delivery of services, better information sharing and the use of business process improvement to streamline key processes and eliminate duplication.<\/p>  <p>  The bodies under my aegis include the Office of the Ombudsman who operate an online complaints system which also allows the complainant to track the progress of their complaint against a public body.\u00a0 Similarly, the Office of the Information Commissioner also has a facility for making online applications for review of Freedom of Information decisions by public bodies, but also accepts written applications for reviews.\u00a0 The Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) use a fully on-line application process since the beginning of the 2007-2014 EU Programme period and I can confirm that SEUPB does not print application forms.\u00a0 As part of their Strategic Plan 2015-2016 the Valuation Office are developing the range and quality of online services offered to their customers in line with their eGovernment Strategy.\u00a0 The application process for campaigns run by the Public Appointments Service is already an online application process through publicjobs.ie.

On the other hand, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focus is on attracting foreign direct investment that is value added, requires high skill levels and a sophisticated business environment to maximize their business potential.<\/p>  <p>  Job creation and retention is central to all activities undertaken by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. In this context, of course, it is the case that the agencies share similar objectives in the development of the enterprise base and the business-environment in Ireland. This includes joint work on the growth of new and existing business sectors in Ireland, the support of collaborative R&amp;D among and between Irish-owned companies and multinationals based here, the facilitation of networks and clusters which enhance enterprises&rsquo; ability to innovate, partner and source with each other, and a range of other on-going activities.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a commitment to develop and publish a suit of regional Action Plans to support enterprise growth, regional job creation and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises development in the regions. The Midland regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched on 29 June.  The South West Action Plan for Jobs, the second of 8 regional jobs plans, was launched on 3 July with the aim of delivering 10-15% employment growth in each region over the coming years. The South West Plan contains 250 collaborative actions. It is the cumulative effect of these measurers in the action plans and the collaboration which they will bring about in their delivery which will make a real and last impact on the jobs potential of each region.<\/p>  <p>  The Succeed in Ireland initiative, which was launched by the Government as part of the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs is designed to lead to additional job creation. The scheme is delivered on behalf of IDA Ireland by Connect Ireland to support any potential investors identified to locate in Ireland.

Gross figures should be used with caution as they do not represent final contributions to GDP as not all products\/services may be considered as final outputs for the purposes of calculating GDP. On the basis of estimated value added by EI clients in 2014 (&euro;12.959bn), the direct contribution of estimated value added totals 7.2% of GDP. An important element of the impact of Enterprise Ireland client companies in the economy is of course the expenditure made on payroll and locally sourced goods and services in Ireland.  In 2014 this totalled &euro;22.9bn.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Enterprise Ireland does not collect official data or statistics on the payroll or corporation taxes paid by its clients. <\/p>  <p>  However, the agency, as part of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact (ABSEI), collects some data which can be used to prepare indirect estimates. <\/p>  <p>  Given the limitations of the data, it is not possible to determine a distribution of incomes earned within client companies, nor data relating to the status or application of reliefs or assessment which impact the final tax contribution.  However, this limited basis, a figure of &euro;1.45bn in annual employee income taxes can be estimated. In addition to income taxes, employers&rsquo; taxes are also a payroll related contribution to the Exchequer. Taking these elements together, a total contribution to payroll taxes in the region of &euro;1.88bn in respect of EI client companies is estimated. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to corporation taxes, a profit estimate based on total estimated value added less the cost of payroll\/other costs is calculated, before applying the average effective tax rate which is taken from research by the Department of Finance Effective Rates of Corporation Tax in Ireland &ndash; Technical Paper, April 2014. Based on this analysis, the estimated corporation tax contribution is &euro;383m. Again caution is advised in the use of this figure as the component data is estimated and not based on actual corporation tax returns for client companies, and excludes tax expenditures through schemes such as the R&amp;D tax credit, SURE (Start-up Refunds for Entrepreneurs) and so forth. <\/p>  <p>  Taken together, the estimated data demonstrates that Enterprise Ireland client companies, located in every county in Ireland, continue to make a substantial economic impact in the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise Ireland Annual Report for 2014 will be laid before the Oireachtas in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600068#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Data","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600068#WRQ02250"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[29934\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600068#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the estimated gross contribution of Industrial Development Agency Ireland supported companies to the gross domestic product output of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[29936\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600068#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total estimated tax contribution to the Exchequer in terms of payroll and corporation tax of Industrial Development Agency Ireland supported companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":791,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 288 together.<\/p><p>The impact of the FDI companies is very significant to the Irish economy with some &euro;2.6bn of materials and &euro;11.3bn of services purchased by these companies annually.  <\/p><p>The most recent data relating to the total estimated tax contribution to the exchequer in terms of corporation tax of IDA Ireland client companies is set out below.

For those forms where there is an eForm available, 80% were used electronically.  Furthermore, since the commencement of the Companies Act 2014, the Companies Registration Office has mandated electronic filing, including electronic signing, in respect of certain forms and the Office remains committed to extending electronic filing further.

My Department through its agencies will build on the 2014 success of the awards programmes such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur with a renewed programme for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The launch of the simplified Startup Refunds for Entrepreneurs Scheme (SURE) in 2015 will provide additional finance for entrepreneurs.  In many cases the lack of a first reference sale is a key barrier to accessing funding at an early stage.  Early intervention through entrepreneur development programmes such as New Frontiers and other programmes help companies accelerate their business development.  EI will support 130 new Entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers programme in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Improving our competitiveness remains a key focus of my Department and Government.  The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report shows that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years, and driven by reforms set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness position has improved in recent years.  As noted in the Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement, this improvement in competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradeable sectors of the economy.  To sustain employment growth, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[30334\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is aware of the need to provide much needed additional job opportunities throughout County Monaghan; the proposals his Department and the State's industrial promotion agencies have to assist in job creation, and in the maintenance of existing employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[30335\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02050","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is aware of the need to provide much needed additional job opportunities throughout County Cavan; the proposals his Department and the State's industrial promotion agencies have to assist in job creation, and in the maintenance of existing employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together. <\/p><p>In general, the Government&rsquo;s approach to supporting job creation at regional level is through the new Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative.  Since the start of the national Action Plan for Jobs process in 2012, employment across the economy as a whole has increased, and has exceeded the Government&rsquo;s initial target of having 100,000 people at work by 2016.  <\/p><p>However, we are conscious that not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of the recovery.  To accelerate progress on the jobs agenda in the regions, last February, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative which seeks to build on the existing strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation. This initiative will see Action Plans drawn up for eight regions.  Cavan and Monaghan are included in the Border Region.<\/p><p>The first two regional Action Plans for Jobs, covering the Midlands and the South West regions, were published in the last number of weeks.  My Department is continuing to work on the finalisation of a number of further regional Action Plans which will be launched shortly, including the Plan for the Border region.  The Plan will focus on building the enterprise base across the region as a whole and there will be an emphasis on collaboration across counties to maximise the potential of the region.<\/p><p>In terms of direct job creation by my Department&rsquo;s agencies, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on working with established companies in its portfolio and supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up high potential start-up companies.  In 2014 Enterprise Ireland client companies created 394 full-time jobs in County Cavan and 382 full-time jobs in County Monaghan.  To date in 2015, Enterprise Ireland has assisted two major investments, in 2015, Lakeland Dairies&rsquo; expansion of milk powder processing operations at Bailieboro and Combilift&rsquo;s investment programme and new jobs in Monaghan.<\/p><p>Regional development is a major component of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new corporate strategy entitled &ldquo;Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;.  For the first time ambitious investment targets have been set for each region, with a strong focus on securing an increased share of investments.  IDA client companies in the Border region now employ 9,734 people and include leading companies in the Engineering, Life Sciences, Financial and Services sector.  IDA secured 47 projects for the Border Region over the past 5 years (2010-2014).  A 30% to 40% uplift in projects would result in 61 to 66 projects for the region for the coming five years.<\/p><p>Counties Cavan and Monaghan are marketed by IDA as part of the North East Region and in 2014 there were 36 IDA clients in the Region.  IDA Ireland continues to engage with all existing companies in its portfolio to influence, drive and support transformation initiatives designed to ensure longevity of investments and ongoing growth and job creation within the client base.  IDA will consider all opportunities to leverage its property portfolio in smaller population centres like Cavan and Monaghan in order to facilitate investment and job creation. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &ldquo;First-Stop-Shop&rdquo;<b><\/b>service assisting in delivering start-ups and growth in the micro-enterprise sector in every County.  The Cavan and Monaghan LEOs offer a range of supports and advice to anyone interested in starting or expanding a business.  Further information can be found on the LEO website at .<\/p><p>At the end of 2014 there were 1,049 jobs in LEO client companies in Cavan with jobs growth of 108 in 2014, and there were 904 jobs in LEO client companies in Monaghan with jobs growth of 61 in 2014. <\/p><p>Each LEO can, subject to criteria, offer financial support to manufacturing and internationally traded services, as well as a suite of other supports to start-up and existing business including training, mentoring, access to loans by Micro Finance Ireland and trading on-line vouchers. <\/p><p>In addition to the normal suite of financial supports, the LEOs in every county are running Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur 2015, with an investment fund of up to &euro;50,000 available to three category winners i.e. Best Business Idea, Best Start-Up Business and Best Established Business. <\/p><p>I am confident that the policies pursued by the State agencies and the Local Enterprise Offices will continue to support enterprise development and lead to an increase both in job creation and in entrepreneurial activity across Cavan and Monaghan throughout 2015 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Leases","counter":831,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02250"},{"type":"question","counter":832,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[29577\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the criteria in place to establish a long-term lease for the new location of the Tralee Oyster Fisheries Society's shellfish dispatch centre, with regard to securing funding (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":833,"content":"<p>I understand that the lease in question is between the Tralee Oyster Fisheries Society and Kerry County Council (as successor of the Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners) and is therefore a matter in which I have no statutory role. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategy Statements","counter":834,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":835,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[29578\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his Department's priorities for the remainder of this D&aacute;il; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":836,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to implementing the priorities set out in the Programme for Government and in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016.

fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export, including a \"standstill\" period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep have been introduced on to the holding.\u00a0 A derogation applies where sheep introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding. \u00a0To avail of this derogation, isolation must be notified to and pre-approved by my Department.  Sheep being exported for slaughter must be resident on the holding of origin for 21 days but a standstill period is not required if the animals are consigned directly to a slaughterhouse in another Member State.  A 21 days standstill period is required in the event that sheep for slaughter are exported from an approved assembly centre or dealer's premises and\/or stop at a staging point in another Member State (transit or destination).  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to intra-Community trade in calves, Member States are obliged under Council Directive 64\/432 on intra-community trade to certify, among other things, that bovines being exported for breeding or production have been on a single holding during the 30 day period prior to export or, if such animals are younger than 30 days, that they have been on the holding of their origin since birth. <\/p>  <p>  The somewhat more stringent rules on intra-Community trade in sheep compared with cattle, in particular, the \"standstill\" requirement, stem from the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 when the general view was that movements of sheep largely contributed to the spread of the disease.  With regard to identification of sheep, all ovine animals intended for intra-Community trade or export to third countries are required to be electronically identified in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 21\/2004, establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals, to ensure complete traceability of each animal.\u00a0 The introduction of EID tags for lambs would not remove the obligations under the EU legislation relating to residency on a holding or the 21 day \"standstill\" period.  The rationale for these requirements is to ensure that sheep going for export do not come in contact with other animals or become infected following such contact.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishery Harbour Centres","counter":843,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR03150"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[29718\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600069#WRR03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures being taken to prevent caravans from entering and staying at the harbour piers in Howth in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":845,"content":"<p>Pursuant to the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 (as amended), my Department has responsibility for the six Fishery Harbour Centres located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, An Daingean, Ros An Mhil and Killybegs.

I have advocated strongly for there to be a clear EU-wide response on resolving this issue and that the Commission&rsquo;s market support measures, while welcome, must remain under review and be deployed as a key part of the solution for EU producers.<\/p>  <p>  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting this week in Brussels, I joined with other like-minded Ministers from other EU MS in calling on the EU Commission to monitor market developments and fully assess all potential market support measures available for the Irish and EU pigmeat sector. Ireland is committed to continuing to work in partnership with the Russian and EU authorities to help to resolve these issues in any way we can. I have met with the Russian Ambassador to Ireland to impress upon him the importance of resuming normal trade relations in agri-food products. In addition there have been two high-level meetings between my Department and the Russian authorities in recent months at which there has been considerable progress in securing new opportunities for Irish breeding, live animals and genetic technologies. However the restrictions on other products under the EU-wide ban is not something which Ireland alone will resolve and will only be progressed through a common EU approach.<\/p>  <p>  Irish agri-food exports to Russia declined from &euro;213 million in 2013 to &euro;145 million in 2014. Some of this reduction was accounted for by a ban on EU pigmeat imports which came into effect in January 2014, before the Presidential ban on most EU food imports came into effect in August. Exports will obviously be much lower this year as the ban will be in place for the full year, with   dairy, fish and pigmeat being the main sectors affected. For the first four months of 2015, agri-food exports to Russia amounted to &euro;15.3 million, an 80% reduction on the same period last year.<\/p>  <p>  However, Irish pigmeat exports internationally in 2014 increased by 12% to 198,000 tonnes compared to the previous year. Increased volumes to the UK, Continental Europe, and Asia offset lower shipments to Russia and some continental European markets. This also meant an increase in value and Irish pigmeat exports rose to over &euro;570m last year. This was helped by increases in exports to key markets such as China and Japan which rose by 20% and 210% respectively as well as securing market access for pigmeat in the Philippines and Vietnam, providing new market opportunities for Irish companies.  My Department continues to work with industry to source new and alternative markets internationally for Irish food.<\/p>  <p>  I am undertaking a number of trade missions in the Autumn including to the US, China and Africa which will be a further opportunity to raise the profile of Irish agri-food in these key markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600070#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600070#WRS01950"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[30103\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600070#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is responsible for all board appointments where such power to appoint persons to State boards is vested in him by statute; if any politically appointed State employee outside of his Department is involved in decision making concerning such appointments, in particular, if, during the lifetime of the Government, a named person (details supplied) has had any influence over any appointments made by him; if he or officials from his Department have corresponded with that person regarding the composition of, and appointments to, State boards to which he has statutory power to make appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department's Statement of Strategy published in April last also provides an overview of priorities for the period 2015-2018 inclusive.  Completing delivery of the comprehensive Reform Programme aimed at enhancing the administration and oversight of policing is a key priority. Much of this has been achieved, including the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No 3) Bill 2014 enhancing the powers of GSOC, and the introduction of  the Bill to establish the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, which was recently passed by the Seanad.  It is my intention that this legislation will be enacted as quickly as possible and I look forward to debating it with Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Other priorities include introducing the necessary legislation to amend the Constitution following the referendum on marriage equality; progressing the recommendations of the Working Group on the Protection Process, and advancing the International Protection Bill to introduce a single protection procedure thus reducing the length of time applicants spend in the Direct Provision System; implementing new rules for student migration and for colleges operating in the Sector; taking further steps to ensure that all State boards have at least 40% of each gender; continued implementation of the Government&rsquo;s reforms around personal insolvency;  supporting implementation of the Fines Act 2014; publication of a reformed and consolidated Domestic Violence Bill and completing the review of judicial appointments.  I also hope to introduce the Prisons Bill, which will facilitate the complete closing of St Patrick's Institution and to secure Government approval in the very near future for the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise and improve the law on bail.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope to implement a number of the key recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group; to progress, jointly with the United Kingdom Home Office, the worldwide rollout of the British Irish Visa Scheme and complete the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  As regards criminal law, the priorities include strengthening the law on corruption and sexual offences (including grooming) as well as implementing the EU Directive on Victims following the recent publication of the heads of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill.  My Department is also developing a new strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence for 2015 onwards.  I am committed to ensuring that the Charities Regulation Authority is in a position to fulfil its important mandate in the charities sector.<\/p>  <p>  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime.  I am committed to tackling it on a number of fronts, including through a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.  I hope to publish the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill very shortly.  This Bill will address issues in relation to bail and sentencing for prolific burglars.  I am also taking forward the recommendations of the 2014 Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation, including crime statistics, and its report on the Fixed Charge Processing System.  I expect to receive the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The resumption of Garda recruitment will make an important contribution, not only to the reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but to the ongoing task of protecting our communities.  Garda reform will involve substantial investment in ICT and other support infrastructure and I will continue working on this matter with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government has committed to the ending of slopping out in the prison system and the number of prisoners slopping out has been reduced by 71% since 2010. The opening of a new prison in Cork later this year will eliminate slopping out in that prison.  You may wish to note that the Irish Prison Service is also advancing plans for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison.  All of this work is supported by the process of organisational renewal underway in my Department, the continuing implementation of which is itself a priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600072#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Staff","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600072#WRU03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[29604\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600072#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding prison officers who are injured in the course of their work and who, as a result, are obliged to retire early on medical grounds; the arrangements in place to allow persons to receive a full pension where they have not worked up their full years' service, and any other compensation arrangements that are in place, if the full pension is not granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1002,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[29605\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600072#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding prison officers who have to retire early on medical grounds as a result of a work-related injury; if injury warranty years can be granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1003,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 361 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service  that it is bound by the guidelines for the award of added years for pension purposes as provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and by the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous) Act 2004.

The Deputy will appreciate that at any one time there will inevitably be a number of warrants awaiting execution. I might mention that in May 2008 there were approximately 117,000 warrants outstanding ; in January 2014 122,000.<\/p>  <p>   As the Deputy is aware, difficulties in relation to the execution of warrants have been a matter of concern for many years, with similar or higher numbers outstanding in the past.  It is also true to say that this is a long standing difficulty for many police forces around the world.<\/p>  <p>  While genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant, I regard it as a priority that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible.  In this regard, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gives priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a very welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The recommendations in the Inspectorate report are a very important element in the overall strategic transformation programme which is underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In relation to the recommendations on Warrants, I am informed that a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants in the context of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis and I am advised that the impact of this process will be the subject of regular updates.<\/p>  <p>  A relevant issue which was highlighted in the Garda Inspectorate report is the number of warrants generated as a result of non-payment of fines in circumstances where previously imprisonment was the only option available to the Court in cases of non-payment.  These warrants make up a significant proportion of the total figure referred to above.  Under the Fines (Payment and  Recovery) Act 2014, which will come into effect later this year, alternatives to imprisonment are now provided for, and the aim is to significantly reduce the number of persons committed for non-payment.  In addition to reducing the number of persons imprisoned for non-payment, this important legislation should also reduce the number of warrants the Garda&iacute; are called upon to enforce.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to significant deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants. In this regard, I have been working closely with Minister Howlin to support the development of Garda systems to meet the realities and expectations of 21st   Century policing and I hope to be in a position to make significant announcements shortly in relation to Garda ICT systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600073#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600073#WRV02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[29923\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600073#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to introduce new anti-corruption legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>Drafting of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill is at a very advanced stage.

Some later stages of the process include paper and email submission of documents so that they can be properly verified as part of the ex-post analysis of the scheme. The potential savings in this case were assessed as not sufficient to justify the cost of a fully on-line system.

However, for many of its services, such as the registration function for non-EEA nationals who reside in the State for greater than 90 days, it is a requirement that such persons present in person.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide. The registration process includes an interview with the person, the examination of relevant documentation, photographing and biometric capture and the issuing of a registration certificate. It also includes the placing of the appropriate permission to remain endorsement on the passport of the person concerned.  <\/p><p>However, the immigration service regularly reviews its service delivery channels including seeking opportunities for making on-line application facilities available where appropriate<b><font color=\"#000080\">.  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p><b>Victims of Crime<\/b><\/p><p>The Victims of Crime Office replaced its paper based application process for funding under the Victims of Crime Funding Scheme with an on-line application process from the 2014 scheme.

This does not rule out a move to accepting electronic lodgement of complaints only in the future.<\/p><p>GSOC has made efforts to encourage electronic lodgement of complaints and communications over the last two years. Complaints are accepted by e-mail and e-mail is used to communicate with complainants wherever possible.  In 2014, 36.5% of complaints were received electronically (a total of 820).

The Deputy will be aware that following a detailed analysis of PULSE data in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, the CSO has recently resumed publication of the quarterly crime figures, along with an analysis of how the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigations impact on the production of these statistics. The analysis carried out by both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate has identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems. A significant number of these relate to ICT issues and some of them are specifically in relation to PULSE.<\/p><p>The  Garda Commissioner has taken a number of steps to respond to the concerns identified in the Inspectorate report, including the establishment of a new Data Quality Team in the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), as well as measures to strengthen PULSE governance arrangements. These measures form part of broader steps to take forward the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations, including plans to upgrade and improve the technology for recording of crime and policing activity. <\/p><p>The compilation and publication of crime statistics is a matter in the first instance for the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency. The CSO is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces. I understand that substantial work has been carried out on this project since the report's publication, and that this work is ongoing. In addition, the CSO has also agreed to chair an expert panel to examine the Inspectorate's recommendations on crime statistics. The expert panel will review the crime counting and detection rules, as recommended by the Inspectorate, with a view to introducing new national standards<\/p><p>  On the question of compensation and the possession of a firearm being a privilege, I wish to refer the Deputy to Section 13 of the Working Group report on the Review of Firearms Licensing which was published in November 2014. <\/p><p>To quote from section 13:<\/p><p>&quot;In Magee V Murray (2008, Judge Birmingham) it is stated in summary: &ldquo;The possession of every firearm is illegal unless authorised by law. The  possession of a firearm is not a right, but it is a privilege&hellip;&rdquo;.<\/p><p>A similar view was expressed in McCarron V Kearney by Charleton J. (High  Court, 4 July 2008).&quot;<\/p><p>Section 13 also notes that the Courts have taken the view that what is in the State&rsquo;s gift cannot be required to be compensated if it is withdrawn. For example, in Gorman v Minister for the Environment (2001, Judge Carney) it was held that the absence of compensation for permitting the issuance of taxi licences to anyone qualified was constitutional. <\/p><p>Finally, insofar as consultation with the Attorney General in relation  to legislative changes is concerned, I can confirm to the Deputy that any legislative changes are subject to consultation with the Attorney General. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1096,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1097,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[30217\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when her Department's annual report for 2014 will be published.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1098,"content":"<p>My Department's Annual Report 2014 is currently being drafted and is expected to be published in the Autumn<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":1099,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1100,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[30221\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600074#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider the establishment of a division of the Small Claims Court to assist business in retrieving small payments from clients, given that such arrears are threatening the viability of many small companies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1101,"content":"<p>The Courts Service have clarified that the small claims procedure of the District Court is an alternative method of dealing with a civil proceeding in respect of a small claim.  The majority of claims are dealt with by administrative staff in the local District Court offices. Typical claims include:<\/p>  <p>  - a claim in respect of goods or services bought for private use from somebody selling them in the course of a business (consumer claims)<\/p>  <p>  - a claim in respect of goods or services bought for business use from somebody selling them in the course of a business (business claims)<\/p>  <p>  - minor damage to property (excluding personal injuries) and<\/p>  <p>  - the non-return of a rent deposit for certain types of rented properties.<\/p>  <p>  The procedure was designed by the Courts Service to handle claims as cost-effectively as possible without involving a solicitor. The District Court Clerk, as the Small Claims Registrar, processes the claims and seeks to negotiate a settlement without the need for a court hearing.  Almost half of the claims that proceed are settled in this way.  If the matter cannot be settled the registrar will bring the claim before the District Court. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, the procedure does not cover claims in respect of debts, personal injuries or breaches of leases or higher purchase agreements.

Currently, adoptions are taking place with countries that have ratified the Convention. The Russian Federation has not ratified the Convention and therefore a bilateral agreement is necessary. A delegation from my Department and the Adoption Authority of Ireland visited Moscow in December 2011 to hold preliminary discussions in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts have been on-going in relation to a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation for a number of years. There have also been a number of meetings with officials from my Department and a delegation from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation regarding a draft bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The Office of the Attorney General has also provided advice to my Department in relation to the draft agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and once adopted in Ireland the child is treated as if they are the natural child of the adoptive parents. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. My Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports. In addition, other issues in the draft bilateral require further clarification. It is imperative that these matters are fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial. <\/p>  <p>   It was intended that officials from my Department visit Russia in January of this year; however, it was decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia through the Embassy to ensure that Irish proposals in relation to the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation before continuing the detailed negotiations. The Irish Ambassador to Russia has been providing the Department with consular assistance in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Russia has to be considered in the context of the overall priorities of the Department in relation to adoption and the general focus of Ireland in regard to countries of origin for Inter Country Adoption.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[29906\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of investment from capital spending his Department has made in County Kildare since 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>My Department operates a number of capital grant schemes, and has supported capital projects in County Kildare under these schemes. <\/p><p>Funding was provided for early years capital developments in County Kildare, and funding was also provided from the Department's capital vote for the Childminding Development Grant and the Parent and Toddler initiative as follows: <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Early Years Capital Developments<\/th><th>Childminding Development Grant Initiative<\/th><th>Parent and Toddler Initiative<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;68,696<\/td><td>&euro;6,594<\/td><td>&euro;8,307<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;59,832<\/td><td>&euro;13,529<\/td><td>&euro;8,326<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;9,140<\/td><td>&euro;2,799<\/td><td>&euro;11,726<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The provision of childcare capital grants has also ensured that many childcare services have been able to maintain the quality of their facilities and continue to deliver quality childcare services.<\/p><p>My Department has also provided some &euro;120,281 capital funding for youth groups in County Kildare as set out in the table. <\/p><p><i>Youth Caf&eacute; capital funding<\/i><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Provider<\/th><th>Amount<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Kildare Youth Services Limited - The Curragh Youth Caf&eacute;<\/td><td>&euro;200.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Leixlip Youth Premises Group Limited<\/td><td>&euro;500.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Scooters Youth Caf&eacute; Rathangan<\/td><td>&euro;54,581.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>County Kildare Youth Hub Limited<\/td><td>&euro;50,000.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>Youth projects capital Funding <\/i><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Project<\/th><th>Amount<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>Curragh Youth Project<\/td><td>&euro;15,000.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Capital Grant Funding Scheme for Play and Recreation was introduced in 2013 to support new and existing play and recreation facilities for children and young people.<\/p><p>Payments under this scheme made to County Kildare are set out below<b>.  <\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Play and Recreation Capital Funding awarded to Kildare Local Authority <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;20,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 <\/td><td>&euro;10,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Strategy Implementation","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[29915\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600076#WRY00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when he will commence the new registration process and if he is satisfied that all services will be registered through this process, as previously advised, by the end of 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>A key priority of the Government is to ensure that quality early years services are available to pre-school children.

This will result in a change of practice in a number of areas relating to early years inspections.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the inspection of early years services transferred from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the Child and Family Agency in January 2014.  Legislative amendments under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 strengthen the current inspection regime and provide a statutory basis for the registration of early years services.  New Child Care Regulations giving effect to the legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  The new registration system will require that anyone seeking to open an early years service must register with the Agency prior to the facility being opened.  The proposed facility will then be inspected to ensure that it meets all the necessary criteria before registration is granted.  Ongoing inspections will be carried out after the service has become operational and children are attending.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for increased sanctions for service providers who do not comply with the Child Care Regulations.

Roscommon child welfare and protection services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The report in respect of monitoring against national standards was published in July 2014.  This inspection report indicated that the service was well managed and that key staff provided appropriate leadership in the context of the transition from the HSE to Tusla.  It also found that children received a child-centred child protection and welfare service which supported them in the key decisions about their safety and welfare.  The associated action plan was accepted by HIQA and Tusla has informed me that the actions had been largely completed by October 2014.  The inspection and the action plan are both published by HIQA on their website.<\/p>  <p>  The data provided to us by Tusla is not disaggregated at county level, but is provided grouped in 17 administrative areas.  In relation to referrals it is important to note that not all referrals would progress to initial assessment.  In the last quarter of 2014, Tusla has informed me that there were 809 referrals of a child welfare and protection nature made in the Galway\/Roscommon area and that 40% of these required an initial assessment to be carried out.<\/p>  <p>  Figures on the allocation of social workers are available by area to me up to the end of the first quarter of 2015.  These show that there were 1,194 cases allocated in the Galway\/Roscommon with 309 awaiting allocation of a dedicated social worker, a reduction of 18% on the final quarter of 2014. Of these cases awaiting allocation, 128 cases were reported as high priority, with 167 cases reported as medium and 14 cases as low priority.  I wish to assure the Deputy that those cases awaiting allocation are responded to by a duty team on a risk management basis.  During this time, specific pieces of work on the child's case may be undertaken by staff working in the duty system.  Nationally, Tusla has been preparing a national review of cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.  This review will inform the overall approach by Tusla for the budget and deployment of social work staff into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In an update on the HIQA inspection and action plan provided to the Deputy earlier this year, Tusla informed me that there were some remaining steps to be taken on one action.  This involved formalising monthly meetings with social work team leaders and family support leaders, and ensuring that the day to day operations of the service reflect the local statement of purpose.  I have asked Tusla for an update on the status of the remaining item from the action plan in Galway\/Roscommon and I will revert to the Deputy when this is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Strategy Implementation","counter":1220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[30241\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will approve funding under the early years capital fund (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1222,"content":"<p>Funding totalling &euro;7 million is being made available in 2015 under the Early Years Capital Programme 2015, with &euro;5 million of this funding available for grants specifically for community\/not for profit services.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issue of children with special needs that require additional supports to enable them to access pre-schools, the Department of Health has informed my Department that, while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for these children, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at a local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. My Department does not collate figures in relation to HSE's provision of such pre-school assistant supports.

Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within mainstream pre-school settings.<\/p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health have agreed to work together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.<\/p>  <p>  A group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has started its work.  This Group aims to have an agreed model by early September, with a view to making a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Services","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[30287\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600077#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the latest figures on the number of children on waiting lists for counselling services; and the average waiting time for child counselling services, by local authority or county.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>Tusla, along with other agencies, provides counselling and support to children and families availing of the Agency's services.

In assessing eligibility for a medical card the HSE has due regard to the legislation and regulations and issues income guidelines to assist in determining who has entitlement to a card. Following on from the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review<\/i>in November 2014, the Minister and I identified, and had implemented, a range of actions to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs.<\/p><p>A detailed programme of reform was drawn up by the HSE with short, medium and long-term actions to be addressed over the period 2015-2016. The HSE has already implemented a number of short term and medium term processes identified in the programme of reform and work is underway on  the longer term actions. To this end, the HSE put arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions with greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. With respect to medical card and GP visit card coverage, as of the 1st of July 42.9% of the population have either a medical card or GP visit card.  Of the 1.9m medical or GP visit cards in circulation on the 1st of July, 88,604 are discretionary medical cards and 39,829 are discretionary GP visit cards, an increase of 11,939 and 5,224 respectively since January this year.<\/p><p>Also as part of the Governments plans for universal GP care the under 6's now have access to GP services without charge and from early August all persons over 70 will be entitled to GP services without charge. This will mean that by the end of the summer, all 800,000 people aged over 70 and under 6 will be able to visit a GP without facing a financial barrier. This will be a significant step towards a universal GP service for the entire population.<\/p><p>If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Prices","counter":1355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1356,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[29710\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reduce medication costs; the reason there is a large discrepancy between the costs here and in other European countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1357,"content":"<p>The Government has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce the prices of drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE. This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines. Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed were achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p>  <p>  The State's current drug pricing agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), which commenced in October 2012, continues to deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency-adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and the UK), and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes. The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over three years. Over half of the savings to be delivered - &euro;210m - were to be reinvested by the State into the provision of new and innovative drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is now being given to a range of options available to the State in seeking to deliver further savings on the cost of drugs. Such options include entering into a new Agreement with IPHA, as well as the possibility of using the legislative powers afforded to the HSE under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to review and alter prices. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health are currently working with their colleagues in the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the State achieves the best possible deal in terms of future price reductions on the cost of medicines. I am confident that a new arrangement will be put in place which will ensure that further price reductions are achieved for the benefits of patients and the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  The continued implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing, as provided for under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, is also contributing to reducing the cost of medicines. Reference pricing has generated over &euro;47 million in savings in 2014, and is expected to deliver a further &euro;25 million in 2015. Reference pricing will ensure that generic drug prices in Ireland continue to fall towards European norms.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.  The size of the market can also be a factor in the prices set by manufacturers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Supply","counter":1358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1359,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[29711\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to review the items which require a prescription; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1360,"content":"<p>Under the medicines legislation, the Health Products Regulatory (HPRA) is responsible for determining the method of sale and supply of medicines in Ireland.  EU and Irish law lays out the circumstances under which a medicine must be subject to prescription including the risk of side effects if a medicine is used without medical supervision or the risk of incorrect or misuse of a medicine.   <\/p>  <p>  The reclassification of the method of sale and supply of medicines is a specific area of focus for the HPRA. The HPRA has been proactively reviewing the classification of medicines since 2014. Prescription only medicines (POM) can in certain circumstances be reclassified from prescription only medicines to medicines that are available over the counter in pharmacies (OTC) under the supervision of a pharmacist. These circumstances include the availability of information on the safe use of the medicine. Medicines which are available as OTC products can also be reclassified in certain circumstances to be made available for general retail sale status (GSL) in pharmacies and supermarkets, without the supervision of a healthcare professional.  <\/p>  <p>  In July 2014, the Authority published a group of 12 substances which it considered suitable for reclassification. These related to over 30 medicines used for the treatment of a variety of conditions including migraine, gastrointestinal disorders, dermatological conditions and others. Medicines containing these substances can, in certain circumstances be reclassified to be made available over the counter in pharmacies and supplied without prescription.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this initial publication of 12 substances, the HPRA in December 2014 identified a further group of substances suitable for reclassification. These included reclassification from both POM to OTC status, and OTC to GSL status.<\/p>  <p>  There were 6 POM to OTC substances. These substances cover medicines used in treatment areas such as irritable bowel syndrome, psoriasis, migraine and topical treatments for inflammatory conditions in muscles, and joints.<\/p>  <p>  There were 7 OTC to GSL substances. These substances cover a range of medicines primarily used topically for the treatment of: minor burns and scalds; insect bites and stings; inflammation and pain in muscles and joints; mild acne; hair loss in baldness. They also include medicines used in the treatment of eye irritation associated with hay fever and oral rehydration salts.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has directly communicated with the marketing authorisation holders for the above products (32 products in total) with a view to determining interest in the submission of reclassification applications and possible timelines for this. The HPRA has to date received 35 expressions of interest in relation to reclassification of all of the medicines involved and is working closely with industry on this matter. The HPRA is continuing to work with the industry in order to progress the necessary submissions and will continue to proactively review the reclassification of medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":1361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1362,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[29713\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600079#WRBB04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the implementation of free general practitioner visit cards for persons over 70 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1363,"content":"<p>The GP visit card scheme for the over 70's will commence on 1 August.

Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day.

Charges apply to those with full or limited eligibility and may not exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension.

All persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. Those charges are a per diem rate which are set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended. It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs. Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system. Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).<\/p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years. The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and day-case activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken. This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It will require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals. The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600081#WRDD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Audiology Services Provision","counter":1445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600081#WRDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[29854\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600081#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to legislate to ensure that qualified audiologists fit and prescribe hearing aids, given that, at present, it is open to persons to set up anywhere and sell hearing aids, often costing up to &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards, also known by the umbrella name CORU, established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 are responsible for protecting the public.

The Deputy will also be aware of the a new EU regulatory mechanism for processing personal data including a new General Data Protection Regulation that is currently being finalised in discussions between  the Member States, EU Parliament and the EU Commission. This regulatory mechanism will, hopefully, bring greater consistency throughout Europe on how personal information, including sensitive personal information, is managed<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>and empowering patients to manage their own health data.  The eHealth agenda will be required to work in harmony with data protection arrangements emerging over the next few years. It is recognised that a number of challenges exists in developing a digital approach to health and that the legal and regulatory framework for health information will require changes in legislation and governance of how data are managed in our health system. In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recent Health Identifiers Act 2014 which provides for the assignment of unique identifiers to patients and to healthcare providers (both professionals and organisations) to ensure that patients safety and confidentiality are maintained to highest degree possible. The Health Identifiers Act also allows for significant penalties to be applied in the case of breaches of the Act by misuse or inappropriate access to the register of individual health identifiers. The application of this Act will apply across the public and private health system to the benefit of patients. <\/p><p>In addition, I am proposing to bring the General Scheme of the Health Information Bill to government very shortly.

The HSE commenced the Finance Reform Programme in 2012.  Central to the establishment of this programme was the recognition that successful implementation of Future Health and the wider reform agenda will require fundamental changes in the way financial management is delivered across the health system in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  One of the early outputs of the programme was the development of a new operating model for finance in health.  The HSE has submitted a business case for the new operating model which defines the case for change and scope as well as providing an estimate of the resources required to deliver the new operating model and supporting technology.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the change programme covers a number of different strands and involves business process re-engineering, most recently the concentration has been on the technology aspect of the Reform Programme.

This will be the subject of Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and peer reviews. <\/p>  <p>  Finance Reform is considered to be the single most important non clinical priority for the HSE.  Work is progressing on the Reform Programme on a number of important work streams.  Key activities being worked on across the reform programme include developing a stabilisation approach for legacy finance systems and a business intelligence solution for identifying and agreeing one national reporting finance system for the HSE.  Significant progress has been made in developing and finalising the approach for the procurement of the key components of an IFMS and the current focus is on securing agreement of the procurement approach. <\/p>  <p>  The new financial operating model will greatly enhance the health sector's ability to effectively manage and monitor its budget at all levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600086#WRJJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Health Policy","counter":1680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600086#WRJJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1681,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[30261\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600086#WRJJ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in implementing the national rare diseases plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1682,"content":"<p>The National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland, which is a generic policy framework for rare diseases, was published in July 2014.

This programme will be responsible for, among others: mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases has been established under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and was established with a view to improve and standardise the quality of care for patients with rare diseases in Ireland by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early timely diagnosis, intervention and coordination of care, and increasing awareness, information and support.<\/p>  <p>  This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.

In addition, the Programme for Government 2011-2016 committed to reviewing the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; system of financing nursing home care with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care which supports older people to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the review were taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation: 1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme; 2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices; 3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services; 4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health); and 5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The review was led by the Department of Health, in collaboration with the HSE, and with input and analysis provided by Deloitte and Touche Consultants on specific issues that required specialised expertise. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health carried out an extensive public consultation before commencing the review.

My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy for 2015-2017 outlines how we intend to achieve our high level goals in the coming years.  These goals are rooted in the priority areas set out in Government&rsquo;s recent policy review &lsquo;The Global Island, Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rsquo;.   Our five goals and the related priorities are outlined below:<\/p>  <p>  To serve our people at home and abroad and to promote reconciliation and cooperation <\/p>  <p>  The further development of the all-island economy and strong support for political stability in Northern Ireland is a major priority for this Government.  We will continue to advance the reconciliation agenda and economic renewal on the island of Ireland including through the ongoing implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  The Government will continue to play our role in the collective effort required to deliver the implementation of the Agreement as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I, through my Department, am also committed to the provision of high quality services to Irish citizens travelling abroad.<\/p>  <p>  I recently launched the Ireland 2016 Global and Diaspora Programme &ndash; one of the seven strands of the Ireland 2016 Programme - which will see an ambitious programme of events take place around the world next year to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  My Department and the Embassy network will continue to develop and deliver this Programme in the months ahead, together with our many partner organisations.  My Department will also contribute to the development of events to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme next year, which is also an important occasion for many on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To work for a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s proud tradition in international affairs as a country which seeks to promote and share its values.  I am determined to ensure that we seek at every opportunity, to make a direct and significant contribution to the promotion of human rights, global peace and stability, most notably through our membership of the UN and our support for its peacekeeping operations, recognising that it is through the realisation of human rights, peace and stability that the root causes of crises such as the current migrant crisis in the Mediterranean can most effectively be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  We will also remain actively engaged in promoting a more active EU role in relation to the Middle East Peace Process and in sustaining the viability of a negotiated, two-State solution.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be a world leader in effectively tackling hunger and poverty and assisting the world&rsquo;s poorest communities to survive and thrive.  A major immediate priority in this area is Ireland&rsquo;s role as co-facilitator of the final phase of negotiations on a new global development agenda to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.<\/p>  <p>  To advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity by promoting our economic interests internationally<\/p>  <p>  The advancement of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education promotion objectives is a central priority for my Department.  The Embassy network will continue to play a crucial role in proactively addressing market access issues, supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, holding promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies and actively contributing to the organisation and conduct of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade missions and events overseas.  While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to ensure that the Embassy network is best equipped to promote and protect Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests in its contacts with other Governments, including in multilateral fora, as well as in its engagements with the business community and overseas media.    The Fourth Global Irish Economic Forum which my Department will organise in November 2015 will play an important role in delivering these objectives.<\/p>  <p>  To protect and advance Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests in Europe<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with our EU partners and the broader region will remain a priority for promoting and protecting our interests.  Ireland will continue to be a strong supporter of the EU Enlargement policy, which is one of the Union&rsquo;s most powerful tools in pursuing our strategic objective of promoting peace, stability, democracy and prosperity throughout Europe.  The crisis in Ukraine, coupled with the profound implications for the EU&rsquo;s relations with Russia, will remain an important priority on the international agenda for some time.  My visit to Kiev on 16-17 July is an opportunity to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine and to hear first-hand about the scale of the challenges it faces.<\/p>  <p>  To strengthen our influence and our capacity to deliver our goals<\/p>  <p>  Irish diplomacy has built a reputation for professionalism, integrity and effectiveness over many years.  My Department will continue to work to extend Ireland&rsquo;s international influence overseas while improving our capacity for delivery at home including though the Civil Service Renewal process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1742,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1743,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[29610\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the response planned to counter the persecution and human rights abuses suffered by Falun Gong practitioners under the Chinese authorities over the past 16 years, particularly in view of the 2013 European Parliament resolution (details supplied) demanding an investigation into and an end of the common practice of forced organ harvesting for such persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1744,"content":"<p>The Government follows closely reports of human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners, including reported cases of organ harvesting, and is concerned about the situation.

Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 8-9 December 2014 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.  The next round of the Dialogue will take place in November allowing the EU to continue to raise matters of concern. In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.  During these meetings the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU.  However, it should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.   Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, including those related to the Falun Gong, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin-Monaghan Bombings","counter":1745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1746,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[29626\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if funding will be renewed in respect of the work of a group (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":1747,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[29627\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he has to raise again at an early date with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the British Foreign Secretary the need for the British Government to respond to the unanimous motions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2008 and 2011 in relation to the need to release papers and documents pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1748,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 610 and 611 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government fully supports the all-party D&aacute;il motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians. Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a recent UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th session in March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015. Ireland also works within and alongside the EU to address   the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Later this month, on 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) will adopt the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.

In the longer perspective, Ireland has consistently acted to keep in front of the Council the need to remember the specific problems of Gaza, and will continue to do so.  The heart of the EU position on the question is that the blockade of Gaza is unjustified and counterproductive, and should be lifted.  There is of course no issue with Israel continuing to prevent the movement of weapons into the territory.<\/p>  <p>  The position in relation to Egypt is somewhat different, in that it is an escalation of violent incidents and instability in the area of northern Sinai which has forced the Egyptian authorities to close or restrict the operation of the Rafah crossing point for long periods.<\/p>  <p>  I note reports that Israel in May substantially increased the rate of movement of cement into Gaza, which is very welcome.  I hope that further measures of this nature will follow.  I fully agree that the pace of reconstruction needs to pick up, and that this requires increased funding and construction supplies.<\/p>  <p>  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, which I attended last October, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards both urgent immediate needs as well as long term recovery efforts.  &euro;1 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal.

However, I have no information on the extent to which those countries may have signalled at the conference a broad timescale for payment, as Ireland did, and which we are fulfilling.  I recall also that many countries linked their pledges to a firm demand for political progress to prevent any future recurrence of the conflict &ndash; progress which has also not yet been achieved.  I have no basis therefore to raise the non-fulfilment of any specific pledge at the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":1756,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1757,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[29633\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to allocate additional funding towards the provision of humanitarian aid for Syria and that general region, given the ongoing conflict, the appalling loss of lives and the need to get essential humanitarian aid to persons living in desperate conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1758,"content":"<p>The crisis in Syria and the region is now in its fifth year.  The human impact of the violence and displacement of communities has been devastating.  Some 220,000 Syrians have been killed, and over 4 million have fled as refugees to surrounding countries. Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on neighbouring countries which are supporting large populations of vulnerable refugees. My colleague, Minister of State Sherlock, represented Ireland at the third international pledging conference for Syria, which was held in Kuwait on 31 March.  He announced that Ireland will provide a further &euro;12 million in 2015 in humanitarian assistance for those suffering as a result of the conflict.  Ireland has been one of the most generous international contributors to the Syria humanitarian response on a per capita basis.  The delivery of our pledge for 2015 will bring the Government&rsquo;s overall response to the crisis to &euro;41 million by the end of this year.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is delivered through our trusted UN, Red Cross and NGO partners.  Ireland&rsquo;s support has been focused on supporting people displaced within Syria and those across the wider region, including in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most difficult features of this crisis is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian workers.  Both the Syrian Government and armed opposition groups are using siege tactics and heavy weaponry in populated areas.  The targeting of humanitarian workers by the group Islamic State (ISIS) means that millions living in the areas which ISIS currently controls do not receive the help they so desperately need.  The UN has responded by delivering cross-border aid, even where the Syrian Government has withheld permission.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and neighbouring countries.  However, we also recognise that   such efforts can only address the humanitarian crisis and that international efforts must be strengthened for a long term political solution in Syria and the wider region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1760,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[29827\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the action or proposals planned to protect Christians and other religious groups from persecution around the world; the note the Government will take of the European Parliament resolution (details supplied) which denounces recent acts of religious persecution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":1761,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[30152\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600087#WRKK03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions or proposals the Government will adopt to protect Christians and other religious groups from persecution around the world; the note that the Government will take of the European Parliament resolution (details supplied) which denounces recent acts of religious persecution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1762,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 and 627 together.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination, including that based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  It is of deep concern that freedom of religion and belief is in danger in many places worldwide.  Members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, have been subjected to appalling levels of violence, discrimination, and harassment.  The recent rise in the number of anti-Semitic attacks worldwide is also of serious concern.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament to pass a resolution on the persecution of Christians around the world in relation to the killing of students in Kenya by Al-Shabaab.  The attack at Garissa University is one of a series of utter reprehensible attacks by Al-Shabaab terrorists on innocent Kenyans going about their daily lives.  Attacks like this target the fundamental rights and values that all right-thinking people hold dear &ndash; the right to an education, freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, pluralism, democracy, tolerance and human dignity.  We and our fellow EU Member States will continue to support Kenya in its fight to overcome this terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have also been shocked by the reports of the brutal killings by ISIS affiliates in Libya, particularly the beheadings of Egyptian Coptic Christians and Ethiopian Christians.  These monstrous acts are beyond comprehension and I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.  They constitute a savage attack on a minority community. Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member. Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a recent UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28th   session in March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also works within and alongside the EU to address   the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Later this month, on 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) will adopt the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.  The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.

While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<\/p>  <p>  On 18 October 2014, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed deep concern and sadness at the High Court decision to uphold this conviction.

The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.   An independent appraisal and ranking of all 263 eligible applicants was undertaken by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, against four criteria specifically related to election observation.  These criteria were experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and \/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster and a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster during the five year period.  Since its formation, four members have resigned from the roster.  Three replacements drawn from the reserve list in order of ranking have been appointed to the roster and the process of appointing the fourth replacement is underway.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilities exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election monitoring and roster administration and helps to ensure that we are acting in accordance with that best practice.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all applicants have been treated fairly and impartially and all unsuccessful applicants were invited to request feedback on their applications. Furthermore the independent review process which was established has facilitated two applicant reviews.  In both cases, the reviewer was of the view that the scoring of both applications was fair and impartial across all four published criteria. I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requisite requirements of the EU and OSCE.  The Department will keep the process under review taking into account developments in the EU and OSCE context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600089#WRMM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":1823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600089#WRMM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1824,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[30407\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600089#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on any meetings he or his officials had with the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mr. Ali Larijani, during his visit here in June 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1825,"content":"<p>The visit of Speaker Larijani was an interparliamentary occasion, and so his main engagements were with the Oireachtas.

These include Circular SpEd 02\/05, Inclusion of Pupils with Special Educational Needs Post Primary Guidelines and the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) Continuum of Support Guidelines. <\/p><p>My Department provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with SLDs.

At that time there were negotiations on the reconstitution of Boards of Management of primary schools.  It was agreed that patrons would no longer nominate a majority of the members of a Board of Management.  In return, it was agreed Deeds of Variation would be put in place to vary the Charging Leases\/Declarations of Trust.  There have been ongoing discussions with the relevant patron bodies in relation to the wording of the Deeds of Variation and the Department has been working with the Attorney General in relation to the matter. <\/p><p>The commitment given by the school patrons in 1997 to cede majority representation on Boards of Management was implemented.

The Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, requires schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. <\/p><p>The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p><p>The Equal Status Act, 2000 provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600092#WRPP04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":2010,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600092#WRPP04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Weather Forecasting","counter":2009,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600092#WRPP04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2010,"qnumday":700,"qnumall":"[29698\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600092#WRPP04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to add weather forecasts from weather stations in Northern Ireland to all of Met &Eacute;ireann's weather reports (details supplied).","asker":"1034","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2011,"content":"<p>All of Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s general forecasts cover the entire island of Ireland.

The meeting is charged with agreeing &ldquo;a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties&rdquo;.  Ireland strongly supports an ambitious, legally-binding global agreement with broad participation. In its 2014 National Policy Position, Ireland recognises global climate change as one of the key global challenges of this century and that failure to address it effectively will result in major adverse impacts that will affect all countries. Ireland is taking steps domestically to enhance its policy framework for both mitigation and adaptation, including through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, and through interdepartmental work on improving policy coherence on climate issues. <\/p>  <p>  The 2015 agreement should provide an enabling platform for all Parties to pursue low-carbon climate resilient sustainable development, taking account of national circumstances and changes in those circumstances over time, and which puts us on a collective pathway to keeping the average global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will be working as part of the EU, including through an EU climate diplomacy initiative, to ensure that the Paris outcome is as ambitious and robust as possible. In particular this will require all Parties to present ambitious intended contributions to the new agreement &ndash; so far 45 countries have put forward their intended nationally determined contributions, covering approximately 60% of global emissions. This includes the INDC of the EU and its Member States, which commits to an at least 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels by 2030; a reaffirmation of the shared long term goal of \u00a0collective action to keep the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius and setting an ambitious and shared direction of travel to send a strong signal for action to all actors across society, including non-state actors, civil society and the private sector; a mechanism or process to ensure that global ambition will be raised over time; a robust transparency and accountability framework that will enable tracking of progress and ensuring all Parties live up to their commitments. <\/p>  <p>As part of this framework, the rules relating to accounting of the land-use sector, including forestry, will be of particular interest to Ireland. Globally, the agriculture and land-use sectors have an important role to play in the transition to a safe and sustainable, low-carbon future. It will be crucial that the sector is included in the agreement in a holistic way and that high-level principles framing the process of developing detailed rules in subsequent years are set out.<\/p>  <p>  In preparing for COP21, so far this year there have been two formal negotiating sessions and there will be two further sessions before the Paris COP. At the UNFCCC, Ireland participates as part of the EU. This engagement is through a national delegation, led by my Department and made up of officials from a range of Government departments and agencies. My Department coordinates participation by the wider delegation in on-going work in this area through a number of EU Expert Groups which focus on areas of mitigation (including land issues), climate science, adaptation, climate finance and technology transfer, along with groups discussing the\u00a0strategic overview and negotiation tactics. The delegation has been active in all negotiations to date under the UNFCCC and specific preparations for COP21 have been underway at EU level for some time. <\/p>  <p>  At Ministerial level, the Environment Council will meet to discuss the negotiations at its informal meeting next week and Environment Council conclusions are expected in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600092#WRPP04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor

The transfer of monies takes place on the basis that the beneficial owner will have a guaranteed right of reclaim to their property at any time in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed but only for the purposes of programmes or projects to assist the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or persons with a disability (within the meaning of the Equal Status Act 2000).   <\/p>  <p>  In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes.  Whilst applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to the unclaimed content of safe deposit boxes would increase the amount available in the Fund, Government Departments and agencies would still have to source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation, in the same way as with any other funding programmes.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the unclaimed content of safe deposit boxes is the property of the safe deposit holder or those acting on behalf of the estate thereof.  Any transfer of this personal property, which may contain important legal documents such as deeds and wills, jewellery, art or family heirlooms to the Dormant Accounts Fund would raise complex constitutional, legal and operational issues.  Consequently, I have no plans to amend the legislation to add the unclaimed content of safe deposit boxes to the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":2025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2026,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[30268\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will approve additional staff for the local enterprise offices in counties Roscommon and Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2027,"content":"<p>My Department has not received staffing requests for additional staff in the Local Enterprise Offices of Roscommon County Council or Galway County Council.

As the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have clearly stated, the focus of the Government is to broaden and deepen the economic recovery so that it is felt by individuals, families and communities in their daily lives.  The overarching objective of my work will be to ensure that, building on the progress already made, my Department continues to contribute to sustainable economic growth and to ensuring that all members of society reap the benefits of that growth.  Social housing is a key priority for Government, as evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced in Budget 2015 and the publication of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 in November 2014.  The targeted social housing provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  Importantly, the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing. <\/p>  <p>  I have set ambitious targets for local authorities for the period 2015 &ndash; 2017 in my announcement on 1 April 2015, with an investment of &euro;1.5 billion in a combination of building, purchase and leasing schemes which will accommodate 25% of those currently on the social housing waiting lists.  On 5 May 2015, I announced funding of &euro;312 million to support some 100 separate housing projects, providing 1,700 units of accommodation across all 31 local authorities.  I will be making further announcements in the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to progress the Government approved Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness.  This national plan is designed to achieve the Government&rsquo;s stated commitment to ending involuntary long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by 2016.  I will continue to engage with Government colleagues, housing authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations to meet the challenges of the increasing number of individuals and families presenting as homeless, particularly to reduce the numbers falling into homelessness and to provide appropriate emergency accommodation for those who require it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to continue the enhancement of planning legislation to ensure we have a robust and effective system.  I am progressing the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 during the current term and will bring forward the Planning No. 2 (Office of the Planning Regulator) Bill in the autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  Building on progress such as the recent lifting of Boil Water Notices for 11,300 Irish Water customers in Roscommon, I will also continue to drive implementation of new arrangements for water management under the Government&rsquo;s Water Sector Reform Programme, working closely with Irish Water, to ensure that the challenges of meeting water demands in critical locations for industrial and commercial development, facilitating economic recovery and assisting job creation are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to oversee the implementation of a range of policy decisions first signalled in the Action Programme for Effective Local and given statutory effect subsequently under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  Work on a review of local government arrangements in Cork and Galway by independent statutory committees is proceeding and I have also established boundary committees to examine local authority boundaries in Athlone, Drogheda, Carlow and Waterford.  Reports and recommendations from these committees are due in 2015 and early 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to advance the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP).  My priority, as part of the programme of local government reform, has been the establishment of Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in all local authority areas.  These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, have responsibility for, and will oversee and manage, local and community development programmes on an area basis, including my Department&rsquo;s SICAP.  The roll out of the new Leader Programme under the Rural Development Programme 2014 to 2020 will also be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise environmental issues and my Department will remain heavily involved in a broad range of environmental matters in the international arena, covering areas such as climate change (including full engagement in the negotiations of a new global deal on climate under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be concluded in Paris in December) and the continued development of the National Mitigation Plan, which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory low carbon development strategy for the period to 2050, as well as the broader sustainable development agenda.  It is essential that our recovery is based on sustainable development with a long term horizon and I am committed to the enactment of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, together with a new national roadmap to help Ireland meet its climate change targets.  I have also recently announced changes to the regulatory regime for household waste collection, including new enforcement measures and the move to pay-by-weight waste collection requirements commencing from July 2016, which I expect will further reduce our reliance on landfill and lead to greater recovery and recycling of waste in the State.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Civil Service Renewal Action Plan and the wider public service reform programme will be key priorities for my Department in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  I will also be continuing the Government&rsquo;s programme of rebuilding trust in politics and I look forward to the outcome of the engagement and consultation process currently being conducted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the establishment of an Electoral Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In addressing this wide-ranging brief, I am committed to driving the work of my Department to ensure it plays a significant part in or country&rsquo;s economic and social recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":2038,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2039,"qnumday":709,"qnumall":"[29596\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600093#WRQQ02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the percentage of total waste; and of electrical waste, re-used and recycled; his views that targets should be set for re-use, where possible, particularly with regard to electrical equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2040,"content":"<p>Latest data in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s waste management performance, including with respect to Waste Electrical &amp;amp; Electronic Equipment (WEEE), are contained in the EPA&rsquo;s National Waste Report for 2012, available on the EPA website (<i>www.epa.ie<\/i>).

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality, while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline values for particulate matter (PM) in some areas.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in some areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, consumers must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that this choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.<\/p><p>In respect to monitoring of water quality, the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, and groundwater quality under the Water Framework Directive.

There was a 5% reduction in satisfactory quality lakes (10 lakes) and further investigations are ongoing as to the cause of this reduction.  Water quality in canals remains very high at over 90% satisfactory.

Currently the quality of the water and the water environment in Dublin Bay is monitored under the Water Framework Directive Monitoring programme which commenced in 2006.  Monitoring is undertaken by the EPA for general water quality parameters and biological quality is monitored by the EPA, Marine Institute and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  The current status classification of Dublin Bay taking all elements into consideration is good.  Some issues do exist in the estuaries of the Liffey and Tolka and these estuaries are currently classified as being at moderate status with some effects of elevated nutrients being found.  Research into the causes of occasional accumulations of seaweed blooms within the Bay has been included in the EPA&rsquo;s research call for 2015.  The four identified bathing waters in the Dublin Bay area are monitored and managed under the requirements of the 2008 Bathing Water Quality Regulations by the relevant local authorities, namely Dollymount Strand, Merrion Strand, Sandymount Strand and Seapoint.  The EPA assessed the monitoring results for these bathing waters for the period 2011 &ndash; 2014 and determined the bathing waters to have the following classification in 2014: Seapoint &ndash; Excellent water quality status, Dollymount Strand &ndash; Good water quality status, Merrion Strand &ndash; Sufficient water quality status, and Sandymount Strand - Good water quality status. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout the bathing season, the local authorities report their bathing water monitoring results to the EPA and this information is published and made available to the public on the national bathing water website (splash.epa.ie).  During the bathing season where any incidents arise at these identified bathing waters the local authorities report the incidents to the EPA using a notification system which automatically reports incident information, including actions undertaken to protect bathers, and dissemination of this information to the public is undertaken via the Splash website and via social media through the @EPABathingWater twitter account. <\/p>  <p>  During the 2015 bathing season to date, four incidents have arisen where faecal contamination was detected at the Dublin City Council bathing waters (2 incidents at Merrion Strand, 1 incident at Dollymount Strand and 1 at Sandymount Strand).  Given the very complex and many inputs into the Dublin Bay area, Dublin City are currently undertaking a Microbial Source Tracking study at their bathing waters to identify the origin of contamination. <\/p>  <p>  The EPA issued a Waste Water Discharge Licence (D0034-01) on 27 July 2010 for the Greater Dublin Agglomeration (Ringsend).  The licence requires works to be undertaken to improve the quality of discharges from the agglomeration to ensure that appropriate protection is afforded to the receiving water environment. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels for public water services including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  The expansion and upgrading of the Ringsend Wastewater Treatment Plant is an urgent priority for Irish Water and a scheme to achieve this is currently being evaluated in partnership with Dublin City Council.

The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.  Similarly, and as with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the planning authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal financial procedures.  Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt and until such time as amounts outstanding are discharged in full, the conditions of the relevant planning permission are regarded as not having been met with the development concerned being unauthorised.  Information on the monetary value of development contribution balances on hand (collected at year end and not spent) is not available in my Department.  In relation to development levy debtors and amounts collectable, local authorities are obliged to include data on current and long-term development levy debtors in their Annual Financial Statements.  The figures set out in the table below outline the position at the end of 2013.  The audited figures for 2014 are not yet available.  Current debtors are debts due in the current year, and long term debtors are debts due in respect of periods greater than one year. An annual breakdown in respect of long term debtors is not available. <\/p><p>  Data on bad debt provisions relating to current development levy debtors, is also included in the table and is sourced from Quarterly Debtor Reports collected from local authorities by my Department.  Restrictions on the use of contributions are necessary.  The charging of development contributions is intended to allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs to public funds of servicing land for private development.  Without such contributions, this servicing would not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer.  The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, therefore provides for income from development levies to be ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, for roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces. <\/p><p>Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas.

Comparable figures for the numbers of retrospective declarations made for private vehicles over a similar period under the old system are not readily available.  An analysis of retrospectively-made Garda-witnessed vehicle licence exemptions in the 12 month period up to the end of July 2012 showed that the total number of retrospective declarations made during that time was over 429,000.

The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge)(Amendment) Regulations 2013.<\/p><p>As a self-declared Charge, the onus is on the property owners to make contact with the Revenue Commissioners and regularise their position in relation to specific properties.  In circumstances where a person believes that an amount is not due because either it was paid to the LGMA, or the property was not liable to, or was exempt from the Household Charge, a person can update their 'Household Charge Arrears Record' online at <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i>or through the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255.  Should a person wish to apply for a Certificate of Waiver in respect of a property, the contact details for the Household Charge Support Centre are available on <i>www.householdcharge.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>The administration of issues relating to unfinished housing developments is a matter for individual local authorities.

Dublin City Council is also implementing a HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of the 4 Dublin local authorities.  There are now over 2,6 00 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme and consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.  My Department does not hold a detailed breakdown, by local authority, of landlords who are receiving payments on behalf of HAP households.  However, I understand that there are almost 1,900 separate landlords currently receiving HAP payments through the HAP transactional shared service hub that is currently being provided by Limerick City and County Council.<\/p><p>Applicants for social housing support are assessed by the relevant housing authority in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions)\u00a0Act 2009, as amended and the associated Social Housing Regulations 2011.  Households that qualify for social housing support on assessment are entered onto the housing authority&rsquo;s waiting list and are considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The\u00a0most up-to-date available figures for housing list numbers, which relate to 2013, predate the introduction of HAP.  However, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published by the Government in November 2014 includes a commitment to undertake a summary of social housing assessments on an annual basis from 2016.<\/p><p>As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, those households in receipt of HAP are no longer included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.  I issued a statutory direction to the local authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.  My Department does not gather or hold any data in relation to the number of households supported by HAP who have availed of this option.<\/p><p>The following table details the number of households being supported by the scheme by pilot authority area.<table><tr><th>HAP Wave 1 Local Authorities <\/th><th>Hap Implementation Date <\/th><th><div>HAP Households <br \/><br \/>14July &lsquo; 15 <\/div><br \/><br \/><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County Council <\/td><td><div>15 September 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>492 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council <\/td><td><div>15 September 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>659 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council <\/td><td><div>15 September 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>357 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth County Council <\/td><td><div>1 October 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>340 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council <\/td><td><div>1 October 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>115 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council <\/td><td><div>1 October 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>229 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council <\/td><td><div>15 September 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>394 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council (Homeless Pilot) <\/td><td><div>18 December 2014 <\/div><\/td><td><div>29 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>HAP Wave 2 Local Authorities <\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council <\/td><td><div>25 May 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>41 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council <\/td><td><div>15 June 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>5 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council <\/td><td><div>29 June 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>0 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Council <\/td><td><div>29 June 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council <\/td><td><div>29 June 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>3 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare County Council <\/td><td><div>29 June 2015 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td><\/td><td><div>2,659 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600096#WRTT04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":2210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600096#WRTT04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2211,"qnumday":768,"qnumall":"[30204\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600096#WRTT04800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has figures on the number of long-term vacant housing units owned by each local authority, and the average turnaround time for vacant local authority dwellings; and if he will provide the latest figures held by his Department.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2212,"content":"<p>Statistics on local authority housing stock are published by the Local Government Management Agency, including numbers of vacant social housing units and the average number of weeks for each local authority to re-let a unit from the date of vacation of the unit to the completion of repairs.

In this context, I believe that the parties responsible for poor workmanship and \/ or the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.   <\/p>  <p>  In March of last year, my Department met with a number of private homeowners from County Mayo whose homes are affected by structural problems.  The problems appear to concern approximately 15 private houses and the period of construction for the houses involved was 1997 to 2002.  My Department was also made aware of problems associated with the cracking of concrete blocks in a small number of local authority estates in County Mayo involving some 17 dwellings.   <\/p>  <p>  Similar to the position in County Mayo, my Department also met with a number of private homeowners from County Donegal in December last year whose homes are also affected by structural problems in the blockwork.  In addition, I visited a number of the affected dwellings in Donegal in late February of this year.  Test reports on the affected concrete blocks, which had previously been commissioned by a number of the affected homeowners, were made available to my Department in order to provide a more detailed and scientific insight into the problems being faced by the affected homeowners.   <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the information available to my Department, a technical report has been prepared for my consideration; I intend to complete my deliberations in these matters shortly.   <\/p>  <p>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the pyrite remediation scheme and while the Act provides that the scheme can be amended, replaced or revoked, this can only be done in accordance with the scope of the Act.  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave resulting from the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstances, such as the presence of contaminants in concrete blocks as appears to be the case in Counties Mayo and Donegal.

This includes the delivery of 35,000 units, through traditional build programmes and through the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), while a further 75,000 households will have their needs met through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation (RAS) schemes.  The operation of the rent supplement scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection and questions in relation to that scheme should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection. <\/p><p>It is not possible to give an accurate costing over 40 years for social housing units provided for under the SHCEP, HAP or RAS programmes.  The value of a lease or rental accommodation agreement is calculated over the period of the agreement.  Each scheme has differing contractual arrangements, the details of which reflect where responsibility for management and maintenance for the individual unit lies.  Furthermore, my Department does not make payments directly to individual landlords in any arrangement within these schemes. <\/p><p>There are currently 6,173 units operational under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), formerly the social housing leasing initiative.\u00a0 Over the course of the Social Housing Strategy it is envisaged that some 11,000 new social housing units will be delivered through this programme.  The average cost of an individual unit varies, depending on the manner in which it is provided under SHCEP.  For example standard leasing units provided by local authorities or approved housing bodies (i.e. those leased from a private owner including NAMA&rsquo;s Special Purpose Vehicle) will have a reduction of at least 20% on the market rent while units purchased or constructed by voluntary housing bodies will have a 5% to 8% reduction.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, at the end of May 2015, the average monthly cost for all SHCEP units (excluding unsold affordable units) was &euro;610, or &euro;7,320 per annum.<\/p><p>Payments made to local authorities under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme cover not just the cost of lease agreements made by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB&rsquo;s) with private owners, but also the cost of units constructed and purchased by AHB&rsquo;s under the scheme and unsold affordable units made available for social housing use.  In addition, administration costs, deposits on newly acquired accommodation and capital advances to AHB&rsquo;s are included in this expenditure.<\/p><p>Since the inception of the Leasing Initiative in 2009, expenditure up to the end of 2014 has totalled &euro; 119.4 million.

At the end of 2014, 485 households were in receipt of a HAP payment.  Expenditure in relation to HAP in 2014 amounted to just under &euro;394,000.  These costs related primarily to the cost of HAP payments to landlords, the administration costs of local authorities and the funding of information material on the scheme for dissemination to prospective landlords and tenants. <\/p><p>An Exchequer allocation of &euro;23.2 million has been made for the HAP scheme in 2015 to meet the cost of, primarily, payment to landlords in respect of an additional 8,400 HAP recipients, as well as the on-going funding commitment associated with the 485 households in receipt of HAP at the end of 2014.  This allocation will also meet the on-going administration costs of local authorities.  The HAP scheme is now available to all categories of households in 13 local authority areas.  Dublin City Council is also implementing a HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.  There are currently more than 2,600 households being supported by HAP at an average monthly rent of &euro;510.  Payments are made directly to landlords by the transactional shared services hub provided by Limerick City and County Council.  At the end of June 2015, payments amounting to &euro;3.27 million have been made to landlords on behalf of households supported by HAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600097#WRUU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2252,"content":"<p>Question No. 783 answered with Question No. 781.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2253,"content":"<p>Question No. 784 answered with Question No. 782.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":2256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600098#WRVV00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Schemes","counter":2255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600098#WRVV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2256,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[29611\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071600098#WRVV00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to widen the eligibility criteria for the warmer homes schemes and the sustainable energy communities programme to include houses inhabited by low-income families in both the public and private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":2257,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes and Better Energy Communities schemes are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department.

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to achieving 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. <\/p>  <p>  Measures currently in place, including Part L of the Building Regulations and the combined heat and power supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, are expected to increase the uptake of heat from renewable sources.  However, analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) suggests that in the absence of further measures a shortfall in the region of two to four percentage points could emerge in the renewable heat sector.  This would represent between one and two percentage points in terms of the overall renewable energy target.  While the cost of such shortfall has yet to be established, the SEAI has estimated that it could be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per percentage point shortfall.  This means that a shortfall in the heat sector could cost between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million in renewable energy credits.  There could also be penalties associated with any shortfall. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis underpinning the Draft Bioenergy Plan indicates that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals including addressing the potential shortfall in our renewable heat levels.

The purpose of the scheme was to ensure security of supply in the framework of continuous electricity demand growth at that time.  These plants will transition out of subsidy consequent to the expiration of their contracts during 2016.  A correction amount, known as the R-factor, will continue to be payable for the following years, based on the difference between a supplier&rsquo;s ex-ante estimate of entitlements under the relevant PSO scheme and the actual entitlements determined two PSO periods later through the submission of audited, verifiable figures to the CER.  The PSO levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for generation constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation, and for the development of renewable electricity.  It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  The CER determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.

While the cost of any shortfall has yet to be established, the SEAI has estimated that it could be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per percentage point shortfall.  To date onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  There is also potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio through our indigenous resources such as ocean, bioenergy and solar energy.<\/p>  <p>  The cost-effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of any new support scheme for renewable electricity.

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and\/or operate a gas distribution system within the State.  I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network. <\/p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline.  The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs.  Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy Gaslink has completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years, including Cootehill in Co. Cavan. <\/p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.<\/p>  <p>The CER recently hosted a consultation on a submission received by it from GNI proposing revisions to the existing gas connections policy, as mentioned above.
