As the number of fatalities rises towards 130,000, there are now over 9.3 million people who are in need of immediate life-saving support. In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.3 million Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries. <\/p><p>  The Palestinian refugee population is of increasing concern to the international humanitarian community. Prior to the conflict, the 500,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria were already poorer and more vulnerable than the general population. While they were originally spared the excesses of the violence, their communities have been increasingly affected by the violence, and are often directly targeted. Increasing numbers of Palestinian refugees are fleeing to neighbouring countries to escape the violence but those that are left behind are at risk.<\/p><p>  I am deeply concerned about the plight of Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk refugee camp just outside of Damascus. UN agencies, including UNRWA, have been unable to access the camp due to fighting in this besieged part of Syria. I was alarmed to learn that UNRWA convoys carrying essential food and medical supplies had to withdraw from Yarmouk recently because of hostilities. Over the past year I have used every opportunity at the international level to call upon all sides of the conflict to ensure that relief organisations can deliver life-saving assistance to those under siege.<\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, both within the EU and the United Nations. Our overarching priority remains achieving an end to this appalling conflict and the horrific loss of life and mass violations of human rights which are its principal result. I am working with my colleagues through the EU and at the UN to support the Geneva II framework, which remains the best option for a negotiated end to the conflict.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the ten most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Last week I attended a Pledging Conference on Syria, kindly hosted by the Government of Kuwait, at which I announced a pledge of &euro;12 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries. With this pledge, Ireland will have committed more than &euro;26 million in assistance to respond to the crisis through a range of established UN partners, the Red Cross and Irish and international NGOs. This humanitarian aid has been targeted at both Syrians and Palestinian refugees affected by the crisis within the country and in neighbouring countries.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a longstanding supporter of UNRWA (the UN agency dedicated to responding to the needs of Palestinian refugees). As well as providing &euro;4 million in core funding to the agency on an annual basis, we have specifically provided &euro;1,200,000 to UNRWA for its humanitarian response to Palestinian refugees directly affected by the Syria crisis. We will continue our support to UNRWA in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[2660\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied) in Pakistan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>The Government remains concerned about the case of Mrs. Bibi.

At this review, concern was expressed about the case of Mrs. Bibi and calls for Pakistan to consider adopting an official moratorium on the death penalty.  During the process, Ireland recommended that Pakistan take all appropriate measures to combat and prevent discrimination against religious and other minority groups, including by removing educational material which could serve to perpetuate discrimination.<\/p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.

The group also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.<\/p><p>  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group in principle, but has not yet considered the manner or the timing in which this will happen. Any such change would have to be provided for by primary legislation. Allowing LPT as a deductible expense will reduce the tax base. Therefore I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer, given the significant budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing legislation income tax is charged under Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of a number of sources of income, which are classified into five separate Cases. Under this provision, rent received by landlords (both individuals and companies) from property in the State is chargeable to tax under Case V, while income from trading activity in the State is chargeable under Case I.<\/p><p>  In the case of trading activity, the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions). In the case of rental activity, however, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997. These are:<\/p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<\/p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<\/p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property<\/p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and <\/p><p>  - payment of local authority rates.<\/p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[2423\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100059#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of residential mortgages here that are classified as sub-prime; the number of sub-prime lenders currently operating in the market; the total value of sub-prime mortgages outstanding; the rate of arrears on these mortgages; the actions specific to the sub-prime sector which are being taken to address arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals.\u00a0 A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link:\u00a0 .<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that, at end September 2013,\u00a0six of these firms had a total of 17,807 primary dwelling (PDH) mortgage accounts and four had a total of 659 buy to let (BTL) mortgage accounts.\u00a0 Regarding the level of outstanding debt on these accounts, there was a total of &euro;3.354bn in outstanding PDH debt and a further &euro;0.132bn in outstanding in BTL mortgage debt.\u00a0 Of that outstanding debt, mortgage accounts amounting to &euro;1.885bn (PDH) and &euro;0.050bn (BTL) respectively were in arrears of over 90 days.<\/p><p>  The same consumer protection framework applies to these retail credit lenders as to other regulated entities including the Consumer Protection Code (for PDH and BTL customers) and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ( CCMA ) (for PDH customers only).

Specifically, these were the upward revisions to Ireland's Gross National Income (GNI) and a number of EU amending budgets, which necessitated additional payments. <\/p><p>  A number of factors are taken into account in calculating Ireland's overall EU budget contribution. The GNI element accounts for approximately two thirds of Ireland's overall payment. Accordingly, our contribution is sensitive to movements in this measure. The European Commission conducts an annual rebalancing exercise on the basis of revisions to national GNI levels. This can involve rebalancing payments each December, either to or from the EU budget, depending upon national GNI movements. This exercise takes into account new and updated GNI data published by the CSO in the annual National Income and Expenditure Bulletin. Last year this led to an increase in Ireland's contribution. \u00a0<\/p><p>  Separately, EU expenditure for 2013 was much higher than had been originally budgeted for and this required a number of amending budgets which were agreed during the year.

","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>In late December 2013 the Lithuanian Presidency of the EU Council reached agreement with the European Parliament on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). The BRRD proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries manage arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level as well as cross-border banks, whilst preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses. <\/p><p>  There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:<\/p><p><b><i>- Preparatory and preventative measures<\/i><\/b>   including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions;<\/p><p><b><i>- Early intervention<\/i><\/b><b><i>measures <\/i><\/b>  which would include supervisory powers and implementing recovery plans;<\/p><p><b><i>- Resolution tools<\/i><\/b>   including appointing a special manager, sale of business, bridge bank, asset separation tools and the use of bail-in mechanisms.<\/p><p>  Bail-in will enable resolution authorities to write down or convert into equity the claims of shareholders and creditors of institutions that are failing or likely to fail. This is an important means of ensuring that a bank s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers. <\/p><p>  I welcome the introduction of this important piece of legislation which is designed to safeguard financial stability and to protect taxpayers funds. The legal text of the agreement is now being finalised by lawyer-linguists and it is expected to be adopted by the co-legislators in April but in any event no later than the end of the European Parliament s current term. Once the final legal text is published in the Official Journal, the rules will be transposed into national law over the course of 2014 and Member States will apply the BRRD from 1 January 2015. It should be noted however, that Member States have until 1 January 2016 to apply the bail-in provisions, although, they are not prevented from applying bail-in before this date.<\/p><p>  In advance of this the ECB\/EBA will complete a Comprehensive Assessment in 2014 in anticipation of the ECB taking over direct supervision of euro-area banks under the Single Supervisory Mechanism later this year. As you are aware the purpose of the Comprehensive Assessment is to ensure that banks are appropriately capitalised going forward. This is seen as an important exercise by the ECB, as they want a clean bill of health for the banking sector in advance of them taking control of supervision. <\/p><p>  Irish banks were significantly recapitalised between 2009 and 2011. This was done in advance of the EBA capital exercises of 2011\/2012, and a considerable strengthening of the banking sector took place. Irish Banks remain well capitalised today.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has recently concluded a Balance Sheet Assessment (BSA) in advance of this years Comprehensive Assessment and the Governor has informed me that there is no additional regulatory capital requirement in the banks as a result of this exercise. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the forthcoming ECB\/EBA Comprehensive Assessment will use a minimum capital threshold of 8% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and while I have not yet received the financial statements of the banks as of 31 December 2013, considering the strong capital positions of the banks as of June 2013, I would expect each of the banks to exceed the 8% Common Equity Tier 1 threshold.<\/p><p>  However, in the unlikely event of a capital requirement arising from the Comprehensive Assessment private sources of capital could be accessed both internally as well as from the capital markets. As recent transactions have demonstrated the Banks now have access to both the debt and equity markets and coupled with the improved market conditions this is a realistic source of capital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100060#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Bond Issues","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100060#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[2588\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100060#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has provided all required information to his Department on bonds held by local authorities with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and if he will indicate the status of these bonds.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>I am advised that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are currently working with the relevant local authorities to ascertain the actual level of exposure that exists in relation to the development bonds previously entered into by IBRC in favour of the various County Councils or local authorities.<\/p><p>  \u00a0I am advised that once that exposure is\u00a0quantified\u00a0the local authorities will submit a claim to the Special Liquidators in respect of the bonds.

The person who receives the child benefit payment is being used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals who are most likely to qualify for the new credit.\u00a0 However, eligibility for the credit will in the first place be determined by who cares for the child for most of the year. Agreement as to who will be the principal carer of a child is a matter for parents or guardians. <\/p><p>  As a result of the Amendment which\u00a0I brought forward at the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer may relinquish the credit such that it can be claimed by a non-primary carer.<\/p><p>  To allow retention of the extended standard rate band by those who no longer qualify for the new tax credit, would ultimately only\u00a0benefit such individuals with higher incomes, i.e. greater than &euro;32,800 per annum.<\/p><p>  It was always intended that the new credit would come into effect for the 2014 tax year and this was provided for in Finance Act (No. 2) 2013.

The aim of these proposals is to ensure that the way schools decide on applications for enrolment is structured, fair and transparent.<\/p><p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. Such a school can also refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion, provided it can prove that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.<\/p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.<\/p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.<\/p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.<\/p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support. With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100061#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100061#WRF04050"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[2406\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100061#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding an application for summer works grant in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[2635\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100061#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a summer works scheme grant will be made available to a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos 240 and 252 together.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that commensurate with the level of funding available for the Summer Works Scheme, applications are currently being assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the governing Circular Letter for the Scheme.

This operates at local school level. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level schools in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).<\/p><p>  My Department recently published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools. These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.<\/p><p>  In addition, my Department published Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch last January. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research.

In determining the Capital allocations, a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB, as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread. <\/p><p>  As part of the CCU&rsquo;s on-going management of available funding during the year, the Unit monitors CEB spending on a regular basis. Should any surplus funding become available, this surplus will be reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.<\/p><p>  The Capital allocations include additional funding which was allocated to the CEBs in the final quarter of each of these years.

The statistics speak for themselves. There are currently over 10,000 people directly employed in meat processing and in many Irish towns the meat processing sector is still the biggest employer.  In addition, approximately 75,000 farmers are supplying the meat processing sector.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection are working closely together to ensure that the employment permits system works in tandem with, and in support of, the Cross-Government initiatives in place to reduce unemployment in the State, in particular in the area of assessing labour market demands in the context of the Live Register.  <\/p><p>  I understand that a potential skills gap in this area is currently being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  In this context, Skillnets, the enterprise-led body funded through the National Training Fund (NTF) under the aegis of the Minister for Education and Skills, has been involved with two of its training networks in the development and provision of a range of knife skills courses for the beef, pork and poultry sectors.

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA).<\/p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. This is to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. There is no automatic entitlement to a payment. Examples of the main types of needs that may be met under this provision in respect of severe weather conditions includes assistance towards the purchase of household appliances, bedding, clothing and household repair and maintenance.<\/p><p>  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  The person may be required to pay the money back in respect of a UNP at a later date, for example, if the person had significant capital or income or was later compensated by an insurance company.<\/p><p>  In response to the recent weather events the humanitarian assistance scheme has been activated. The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means-tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repairs as a result of the flooding damage.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. <\/p><p>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100066#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100066#WRL02350"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[2292\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100066#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) is entitled to a social protection payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an invalidity pension appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 19<sup>th<\/sup>   December 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100066#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[2305\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100066#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; if the decision will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, has decided to disallow the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.

In the independent evaluation of JobBridge, it was found that 35.9% of interns hold qualifications below primary degree level, with 22.4% of interns having a post-graduate qualification. Given those high numbers of interns holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is obviously necessary that JobBridge is in a position to offer them an internship that meets their needs.<\/p><p>  It is worthy of note that many professions and occupations offered internships to graduates prior to the commencement of Jobbridge.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  The implementation of revised maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme was approved by Government on 5 June 2013, following an extensive review of the private rental market undertaken by the Department.  The revised rent limits came into effect on 17 June 2013 and will remain in place until 31 December 2014.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money was achieved whilst, at the same time, ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>  During the rent limit review, the Department used information from rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to analyse actual rental costs in each county across the country. The Department also used publicly available data sources including the Central Statistics Office rental indices, the Daft.ie Rental Report and websites, advertising rental properties to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties.  Rent limits were set to ensure that approximately 35% of available supply of housing is available to rent supplement tenancies. <\/p><p>  The Department also sought the views of a number of stakeholders to inform the review process, including Departmental staff with responsibility for the administration of the rent supplement scheme. <\/p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have been provided for in North Kildare and Bray areas. <\/p><p>  Officials in the Department will continue to monitor the impact of the revised rates ensuring that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01050"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[2654\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for the refusal of every application for social welfare in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>The supplementary welfare allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims, by the person concerned, were disallowed by a Designated\/Deciding Officer of the Department on the grounds that she failed to disclose her means. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeals in this case were referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to convene an oral hearing of both appeals. <\/p><p>  Every effort will be made to hear the cases as quickly as possible and the appellant will be informed when arrangements for the oral hearing have been made. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Places","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01250"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[2662\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100068#WRN01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of new community employment places that have been created in each county in 2013; the work types to which they have been allocated; and her plans to create further places.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>The following table details the additional places that have been allocated since January 2013 either to specific Community Employment (CE) schemes within each county, or to the DSP Divisional Manager for allocation within their division.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  Currently a person's date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes.  To qualify for a state pension a person must:<\/p><p>- have entered insurance before the age of 66;<\/p><p>- have at least 520 paid contributions; and<\/p><p>- satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 is required for a full rate pension).<\/p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is a means tested payment may be made to an individual who does not qualify for a pension in their own right or qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in insurance or the means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The scheme was designed to with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.  Under the pension reform programme, there is a plan to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will closely reflect the rate of payment received.  For example, 30 years of contributions (1560) could qualify a person for maximum State pension (contributory).  A person wold accumulate 1\/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30\/30ths inclusive of a certain number of credits.  The introduction of new rate bands in September 2012 moves somewhat closer to this process.  It had been planned to introduce this change in 2020 but in the context of changing demographics and longer working, this date may be brought forward. <\/p><p>  In relation to the person concerned, she entered social insurance on 6 November 1967.  In this case, when determining entitlement to State pension contributory (SPC) the yearly average is calculated from her date of entry into insurance to the last complete tax year before reaching their 66 birthday.  This person has a yearly average of 14 which equates to the current rate payable to her.  Under the current legislative provision, there is no other way in which to calculate the rate of pension payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100069#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100069#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[2838\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100069#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the grounds on which an application for carer's allowance was refused in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; the amount by which they exceeded the limit; if this inquiry can be accepted as the basis for an appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Directive also requires that all biofuels used to meet the 10% target must comply with certain sustainability criteria. That is, they must not be made from feedstocks sourced from certain categories of land, and must achieve certain greenhouse gas emissions reductions.<\/p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 by the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target.  The scheme, administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), is certificate based and, since January 2013, an obligated road transport fuel supplier, at the end of each obligation period (calendar year), must hold six biofuel obligation certificates for every 94 litres of petroleum based fuel it has placed on the market. Certificates are only issued for biofuels that have been demonstrated to have complied with the sustainability criteria of the Directive. <\/p><p>  The Renewable Energy Directive requires that the contribution made by biofuels produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material be considered to be twice that made by other biofuels. Section 44G of the Act gives effect to this provision and requires NORA to issue two certificates for each litre of sustainable biofuel that the agency has determined has been made from such materials.  I understand that in the last week NORA determined that biofuels from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) would be eligible for double certificates.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in the Irish market can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kildare. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m premises with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Kilcullen in County Kildare before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.<\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100070#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Sector Regulation","counter":789,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100070#WRP03450"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[2814\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100070#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will consider liaising with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland with a view to revising the newly drafted sound and vision scheme so that it provides improved support and opportunities to community media; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[2815\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100070#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to the proposed public service broadcasting charge, if he will consider apportioning some of the income from the charge to support community broadcasting that operates on a not-for-profit basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Accommodation and staffing are among the most significant cost components of public sector organisations and it is incumbent on all agencies to achieve economy and efficiency.  In this context, the Board of IFI has commenced a strategic rationalisation of its Dublin based accommodation.  On its establishment, IFI had accommodation at three locations in Swords, including leasing a headquarters building, and premises in Glasnevin and Blackrock.  As part of this rationalisation, and in keeping with Government policy to exit from expensive leases wherever possible, IFI exercised the break clause on the Swords Headquarters when it arose and has already disposed of the Glasnevin premises.<\/p><p>  A key part of the accommodation strategy is the rationalisation and amalgamation of all Dublin property, including the Blackrock Office.  This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and savings over time in relation to lease rents.  In addition, the significantly better energy efficiency of the new Headquarters facility in City West, which will also be consistent with Government commitments as regards reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption, will also generate efficiencies.  The rationalisation will also assist in financing the fitting out of the new headquarters and other property rationalisations outside Dublin.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the current proposal is to transfer Blackrock staff to the new IFI Headquarters Office in Citywest when it is complete.

BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012.  They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m plus &euro;30m contingency and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources.  The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives.  It was understood from the engagement with BGE that the majority of the funding under the heading of brand management and customer engagement would be used for customer engagement.<\/p><p>  These establishment costs were initially funded by BGE and subsequently financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF).  No Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure has been provided to BGE or to Irish Water for establishment costs.  As these costs were to be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water, they would also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  Against this background, and in advance of the establishment of Irish Water, my Department provided confirmation to BGE that spending being properly incurred on the water services activities would be recoverable in the event that the project was not proceeded with or, subject to meeting certain conditions, be recoverable as part of the funding model to be reviewed by the Commission.  This initial commitment was provided by my Department in December 2012 and updated on a number of occasions in advance of the incorporation of Irish Water and the consent to the NPRF lending.  My consent, given with consent of the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF for metering and establishment costs was provided in July 2013, with an understanding of the overall estimated budget involved.  My Department was notified of some &euro;62m in spending over the course of the months immediately prior to the incorporation of Irish Water in July 2013. In compliance with the conditions attached by my Department to the recovery of establishment costs, BGE confirmed that public procurement rules were being observed and provided a report on the outcome of the process in March 2013.<\/p><p>  The procurement by Irish Water of external resources was a matter for the company and I had no role in approving individual contracts.  However, the company has indicated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last week that the following major companies were used by the Irish Water Programme to help deliver the required systems and processes in the establishment of Irish Water - IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG.  The company also indicated that to date some &euro;50m has been spent on external service providers in establishing Irish Water.  Further details of the contracts relating to the establishment of Irish Water are set out in the submission made by the company to the Joint Oireachtas Committee last week and this submission has been published on the company&rsquo;s website at www.water.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Installation","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[2281\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for the valuable scrap metal that will be collected during the course of works to install water meters.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.<\/p><p>  The current water meter installation programme commenced in August 2013 and the approved budget for the programme is &euro;539 million (excluding VAT) which includes the supply of materials and the installation work by contractors operating in eight regions.  The total spend on the programme at the end of 2013 amounted to approximately &euro;35 million.  It is estimated that 1.05 million meters will be installed under the programme; with about 400,000 by the end of this year, over 800,000 by the end of 2015 and the balance in 2016.  The current rate of installation is some 27,000 meters a month and approximately 94,000 meters have been installed to date.  A breakdown of the installations by region is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><i>Meter installations by region<\/i><table><tr><th>Region <\/th><th>All <\/th><th>North West <\/th><th>West <\/th><th>South West <\/th><th>North East <\/th><th>Dublin City <\/th><th>Midlands <\/th><th>County Dublin <\/th><th>South East <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Meter <\/td><td>93,640 <\/td><td>7,012 <\/td><td>6,520 <\/td><td>7,790 <\/td><td>12,445 <\/td><td>13,613 <\/td><td>22,064 <\/td><td>15,646 <\/td><td>8,550 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  A study by Irish Water on the approach to metering further categories of households, including apartments and properties with shared service connections, has been finalised and recently submitted to my Department.  The approach in relation to such households will be developed when the study has been considered in more detail.  The nature of the works may restrict access to driveways temporarily and will cause some disruption to the public road or footpath outside people's homes and area, which may last for a few days.  Irish Water advises that this is unavoidable, but it is endeavouring to keep this disruption to a minimum and to ensure that safe pedestrian access to properties is retained while the work is carried out.  There may be instances where access to driveways is blocked overnight to ensure that reinstatement is carried out to the highest level and this is done in accordance with all relevant health and safety requirements, including facilitating access by emergency vehicles.  A strong focus has been placed on customer communications during this process and any additional support or advice can be arranged for householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns by ringing the Irish Water call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation.  The meter will be installed, where possible, at the stop valve on the public footpath or verge outside a property.  The water meters are the property of Irish Water and it is illegal to tamper with a meter. However, it will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings.<\/p><p>  Irish Water will aim to reuse existing water meters that are owned by the local authority, where possible.  If the meter has the potential to be reused it will be removed and examined to make sure that this is possible.  If it is suitable it will be reused within the programme.  Where it is not deemed possible to reuse the meter, it will be disposed of in the most sustainable manner possible by the contractor in accordance with the requirements of the contract.<\/p><p>  The contractors for the 8 meter regions received, as part of their contract, details of the panel of subcontractors formed by my Department.  The contractors may employ from that list, but are under no obligation to do so.  The employment of subcontractors is a matter for each regional contractor. Irish Water carries out compliance checks on the contractors.  All contractors have also provided information on employees to ensure compliance with the social Inclusion obligations.  Data supplied to the Department by Irish Water indicates the following levels of employment created by the metering programme to date.   <\/p><p>Employment created by metering programme   <table><tr><th>No of employees on contract <\/th><th>No of employees from SMES <\/th><th>No of employees from unemployment register <\/th><th>No of apprentices\/graduates <br \/><br \/>&amp;amp; school leavers <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>871 <\/td><td>475 <\/td><td>156 <\/td><td>57 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>54.5% <\/td><td>17.9% <\/td><td>6.5% <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>As the metering programme will still be underway when charges are introduced, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair.  The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation which will be undertaken by the Commission for Energy Regulation as part of the regulatory process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Provision","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04150"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[2293\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 103 of 28 November 2013, if he is now in a position to provide the full details of the service level agreements which have been undertaken between Irish Water and each local authority; the way these agreements will determine funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services in 2014 in each case; the euro amount expected to be required in each case; the dates on which such moneys will be transferred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[2723\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the details of the incentive payments section of the service level agreements signed with local authorities; if he will detail those eligible for the payments; the criteria used; if he will indicate who will pay for them; the estimated spending on the payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[2724\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of local authority staff covered by the service level agreements; the number of staff anticipated to leave the local authority water section during the SLA period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 424, 462 and 463 together.<\/p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements.  The agreements signed between Irish Water and individual local authorities were based on a generic template.  A copy of the generic Service Level Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The agreements signed by each authority and Irish Water were tailored to the individual authority circumstances, reflecting numbers of local authority staff covered and the operational budgets appropriate to the cost of providing water services within each authority area.<\/p><p>  The Service Level Agreements are based on achieving efficiencies without the need for incentive payments.  They are set in the context of a Framework Agreement for Service Level Agreements agreed at the Irish Water Consultative Group.  This agreement outlines that the Service Level Agreement will include a programme to improve the efficiencies in water services operations, including investment in infrastructure and new technologies, training and up-skilling, and reflecting best practice in standard operating procedures and processes.  Each Service Level Agreement in place with a Local Authority is supported by an Annual Service Plan which reflects the required programme of transformation for that authority.  Funding under each Annual Service Plan is designed to reimburse the local authority for the costs incurred on water services and staffing levels will be reviewed each year as part of the Annual Service Plan.<\/p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 provides an amount of &euro;490m for Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014; the final outturn figure for 2014 is likely to be slightly less than this amount.  This amount provided will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities; these expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants.  Within this overall framework, the agreement of budgets with local authorities and the payments for services provided are matters for Irish Water.  The Annual Financial Statement of each local authority for 2014 onwards will explicitly detail the cost of services provided to Irish Water and the related payments received in each financial year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04550"},{"type":"question","counter":848,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[2301\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100071#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the new legislation pertaining to noise pollution.","asker":"1065","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":849,"content":"<p>The <i>Programme for Government<\/i> includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, <i>inter alia<\/i> , through the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines).\u00a0 The development of new noise legislation by my Department is being considered in the context of this commitment.

In addition, the European Communities (Renewable Energy) Regulations 2011 require public bodies to fulfil an exemplary role (in the context of Directive 2009\/28\/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources) when constructing or renovating public buildings after December 31st, 2011.&rdquo;   <\/p><p>  In terms of mitigating carbon emissions arising from buildings in State ownership, it is expected that energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy will play a key role.

In that context and in order to deliver cost efficiencies, a programme involving fire authorities aggregating demand and jointly procuring 17 fire appliances is now nearing completion, under which Kilkenny Fire and Rescue Service has received an allocation for a new appliance which is under construction.   <\/p><p>  Given the constraints on public finances, further support from my Department&rsquo;s fire services capital programme to replace Grauigenamanagh fire station will have regard to national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, Kilkenny County Council&rsquo;s priorities, the extent of previous investment in Kilkenny fire service, the value for money offered by proposals and the status of existing facilities having regard to risk categorisation.<\/p><p>  In 2013, I published a policy document titled: <i>Keeping Communities Safe<\/i> (KCS), which sets the future direction of fire services in Ireland.\u00a0 This is intended to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively and that the downward trend in the level of fire loss recorded annually continues. KCS includes, inter alia, the re-alignment of structures to deliver effective fire services.\u00a0 This provides for fire services to remain as a local authority function, but service delivery is to be reshaped from the current 30 fire services to 21, with 14 single fire authorities and 7 &lsquo;shared services&rsquo;.\u00a0 Carlow \/ Kilkenny is included among the &lsquo;shared services&rsquo;.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  There is significant experience among fire authorities of delivering aspects of their services on a &lsquo;shared service&rsquo; basis. This experience, coupled with the work already underway to integrate fire services in Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford, will provide a solid basis for developing an appropriate model of shared services for fire authorities, based on populations in the range of 120,000 to 200,000.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100072#WRR03300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Eligibility","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100072#WRR03350"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[2664\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100072#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in view of the changes to the housing aid for older people scheme, if a local authority can now reject an application on the basis that a person under the age of 65 who is not the applicant or the partner or spouse of the applicant is living in the house for which the funding is applied for; if so, the support that is available to an applicant in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Any person who applied for a grant prior to January 2014 will have their application processed in accordance with the guidelines in place at that time. These applicants will not be affected by the changes to the terms of the schemes. <\/p><p>  The changes were made on foot of the report of a review group, established last year by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability. Membership of the group included members of both the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority housing personnel and officials from my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, ALONE, HSE, Ataxia Ireland, the Irish Society for Autism and the National Disability Authority. The aim of the review was to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.   <\/p><p>  There has been no change to the maximum grant available under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability which remains at &euro;30,000 or the Mobility Aids Grant which remains at &euro;6,000. In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People, the maximum grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000. The average grant paid under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995 respectively, well below the maximum available. The age limit for eligibility has been increased from 60 to 66 years. However, a lower age limit may apply at the discretion of the local authority in certain cases.   <\/p><p>  Changes have also been made with regard to the assessment of means of applicants. To bring it into line with the means assessment for applicants for social housing, all household members&rsquo; income, with certain exceptions, will be included in the assessment of means.  The level of income beyond which no grant is payable has been reduced from &euro;65,000 to &euro;60,000. In the case of an applicant where a household member is aged under 65, there is no impact on grant eligibility.  However, where appropriate their income will be taken into account in accessing household income. <\/p><p>  I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% in 2014 to &euro;38.4 million. Every local authority has increased funding for grants compared to the initial allocation in 2013. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of grants to applicants under the various grant measures, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The terms and conditions of the schemes must be applied uniformly and consistently across all local authority areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100072#WRR03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":916,"content":"<p>Question No. 451 answered with Question No. 426.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":917,"content":"<p>Question No. 452 answered with Question No. 421.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":918,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 453 and 454 answered with Question No. 426.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":919,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 455 and 456 answered with Question No. 446.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Establishment","counter":920,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100073#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":921,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[2718\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100073#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason behind appointing Bord G&aacute;is as the State agency in which to embed Irish Water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":922,"content":"<p>The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations in an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.

","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":966,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 and 494 together.<\/p><p>  The local government funding model is changing considerably in 2014. Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing this year, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund, as General Purpose Grants. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing.<\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed.<\/p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allowed maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. In allocating general purpose funding for 2014 I have sought to ensure, in combination with the funding being made available through Irish Water, that these elements of support for local authorities would be maintained around 2013 levels. It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances.<\/p><p>  The <i>Revised Estimates<\/i><i>Volume<\/i><i>for Public Services 2014<\/i>   provides   an amount of &euro;490m for   Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014 ; the final outturn figure for 2014 is likely to be slightly less than this amount. This amount provided will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities ; these expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources and   general purpose grants.<\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100074#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":967,"content":"<p>Question No. 481 answered with Question No. 423.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100074#WRT02250"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[2852\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100074#WRT02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to set up a specific parliamentary question office within Irish Water; the timeline for its establishment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a result, the risk of gambling being used for criminal activity will be greatly reduced and consumers will be afforded a high degree of protection. <\/p><p>  The new controls will operate in several ways and at different stages. For example, to begin with, all applicants for licences must supply detailed information about themselves, their past records (whether in Ireland or abroad), and about their businesses. The information must include details of all convictions (in Ireland or elsewhere). <\/p><p>  Where licences are granted, a dedicated inspectorate will ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.  The legislation will provide that the inspectorate must include persons qualified in all the disciplines required for the inspection of gambling operations and venues. The inspectorate will be able to bring prosecutions or may impose administrative sanctions in appropriate cases. <\/p><p>  There will be controls directed particularly at unlicensed operators, and in particular, at remote operators, many of whom will be based outside the State. The regulator will be able to apply for Court Orders to prevent, disrupt or obstruct receipt of the unlicensed service; these Orders will result in what is commonly referred to as &quot;blocking&quot; of the website.  The Orders may also restrict publicity, including advertising that refers in any way to the service, as well as prohibiting banks from executing financial transactions with the unlicensed operator.  <\/p><p>  The Bill will facilitate enhanced cooperation arrangements at international level between regulators. These arrangements will enable exchanges of information between our authorities and their counterparts abroad. This will give the Irish authorities access to very wide and  rich information on operators and it can be used to verify statements or claims made to the Irish authorities. <\/p><p>  As can be seen, the Bill will provide a varied and comprehensive set of measures to address illegal gambling. <\/p><p>  The Bill is being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is expected to be published in early 2015. Meanwhile, the general scheme of the Bill is available on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100075#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Penalty Points System","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100075#WRU02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[2408\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100075#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No.178 of 23 October 2013, if he will provide for each month of 2013 the number of motorists appearing in court charged with offences under the Road Traffic Acts incurring penalty points who avoided convictions because they agreed to make a donation to the court poor box.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>The court poor box is a non-statutory system used mostly by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.

I understand that no court venue was singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.

I will, therefore, reiterate my views on this occasion.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. Any extension of the scope of the Bill beyond that of &quot;legal practitioners&quot; as so defined in terms of practising solicitors or barristers would have to be considered separately at some future time if it were ever to become an agreed policy or legislative objective. Moreover, it must be acknowledged that while legal executives have a range of recognised functions they are not a homogenous group and tend to provide support in discrete areas of legal practise such as those of conveyancing, probate, commercial or family proceedings and to have a range of personal qualifications appropriate to performing the respective legal tasks concerned.  As set out on the web-site of the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd. in regard to such legal executives, &quot;he\/she is often entrusted with the practicalities of progressing a given legal transaction initiated by the practitioner&quot;. In very many instances, therefore, it is those Solicitors or other legal practitioners who are the principals of the legal practices or firms concerned who ultimately carry responsibility for the actions of their employee legal executives, including under the relevant legislative provisions and professional codes.<\/p><p>  It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd. that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes way beyond their current functions and those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  They relate <i>inter alia<\/i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the  regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which have separate and very distinct histories and do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. As such, they are premature in a number of key respects and give rise to a  range of substantive issues that cannot be addressed, in legislative terms, by merely adding a handful of provisions to this Bill.<\/p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot; in the future, the very far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary.  Such proposals, including their constitutional and other substantive aspects, will need to be considered carefully and separately on their own merits at some future time if they are ever to become matters of determined Government policy for implementation. Others, including that of the profession of conveyancer, will come to be considered in due course by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. As recognised by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, based on the experience of its own members, it nonetheless remains open to legal executives, who are so minded, to pursue other careers such as those of Commissioner for Oaths or solicitor or barrister by way of capitalising on their acquired legal knowledge, qualifications and experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100076#WRV02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1064,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100076#WRV02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[2820\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100076#WRV02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures being used to investigate the criminal backgrounds of persons coming to Ireland; if all persons coming to Ireland are screened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1066,"content":"<p>Under section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 an immigration officer may refuse to give permission to a non-national to enter the State under certain circumstances, including where the person has been convicted of an offence punishable under the law of the place of conviction by imprisonment for a period of one year or more.<\/p><p>  A non-national may also be refused permission to land or be in the State if an immigration officer has reason to believe that the non-national&rsquo;s entry into, or presence in the State, could pose a threat to national security or be contrary to public policy, or where there is reason to believe that the non-national intends to enter the State for a purpose other than their stated purpose.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995.      <\/p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association as soon as possible in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100077#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100077#WRW02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100077#WRW02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1119,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[2285\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100077#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their single farm payment for 2008, 2009 and 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1120,"content":"<p>As part of a review of land parcels declared for the purposes of benefiting from payment under the Single Payment Scheme and other area-based Direct Payment Schemes, the person named was written to by my Department in April 2011 with regard to ineligible areas on one of their land parcels declared for the scheme years 2009 and 2010 which had given rise to overpayments in both the scheme years 2009 and 2010.<\/p><p>  Following a complete review of the circumstances of this case, the penalty applied to each of the scheme years 2009 and 2010 has been reduced by 90%.

Confirmation of the renewal of State Aid approval for this Scheme is awaited from the European Commission and no definitive allocation can be made until this process is completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Eligibility","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[2534\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if contact has been made with a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; and the progress that has been made in resolving the dual claim issue in this case.","asker":"1074","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>Following initial processing of the application of the person named, dual claims were identified in respect of a number of land parcels declared.

I have been actively assessing the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast. I am aware of the critical importance of this local pier and harbour infrastructure to the 1900 odd inshore fishing vessels that provide a backbone to our inshore fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  The Government in considering the totality of the impact of the storms decided that the Local Authorities need to do a full assessment of the damage and the costs involved and should revert to Government in the coming weeks. That comprehensive assessment will then enable Government to decide on a fully informed response to the damage that was wreaked on our coastal communities as a result of these exceptionally bad storms.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue of Government support for inshore fishermen for losses of equipment or boats, it is useful to recall that there are a range of grant aid schemes already available to inshore fishermen, which are administered by BIM. <\/p><p>  There have been some reports in the media about the loss, by some inshore fishermen, of their pots. It is not unusual for inshore fishermen to experience some pot losses through the winter. It is too early to fully determine the scale of the losses and if these were widespread.  I will in the coming days be endeavouring to assess the scale of losses that may have occurred.<\/p><p>  In deciding on an appropriate response to the situation that emerges I will have to take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options. The EU requires that any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under State Aid rules no aid may be given for the replacement of any lost or damaged fishing boats.  <\/p><p>  In relation to pots, the European Fisheries Fund Regulation does allow for financial assistance for purchase of pots but only where the replacement pots provide for more selectivity in relation to by-catch and under size fish.  Any such assistance to purchase fishing gear may not increase the ability of a vessel to catch fish and would be difficult to implement without the risk of breaching State Aid rules.  <\/p><p>  However, while all of these constraints and considerations exist, I am still endeavouring to get a full picture of the situation and when that is to hand I will be in a better position to inform Government and determine what responses are practical and appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1177,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[2549\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100078#WRX02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an appeal against a single farm payment reduction by persons (details supplied) in County Kerry will be accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1178,"content":"<p>A review of the land declared by the person named under the Single Payment Scheme identified that ineligible features were included on some of the land parcels.

Of the eight recommendations made in the previous inspection, inspectors found that seven had either been completed or were ongoing and one recommendation, in relation to the development of a programme of works to ensure the structural and decorative order of the centre, had been partly completed.   The inspection stated that there continued to be a good standard of care provided to children and that there was a committed management team and motivated staff group who were ensuring the delivery of a child centred service.<\/p><p>  The report noted that the external door of the unit was locked from 8pm to 8am in an attempt to stop children leaving the unit at night.  Inspectors found that children were at risk when in the community at night.  The report also noted that the unit should not lock its external door as it was not a secure unit.  Inspectors also had some concerns regarding fire drills and safety.   The Report notes that the HSU staff team were providing a service to some children who required a different resource to meet their needs in terms of their high risk behaviours.  Such children were found to be not suitably placed in an open residential setting at this time.

Children are place in Special Care under the jurisdiction of the High Court and all cases are reviewed on a monthly basis by the High Court.  These Units are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) with the level of care being provided in the three Special Care Units having been endorsed by the most recent 2012 HIQA reports.<\/p><p>  The Agency has informed me it is currently implementing a capital development programme for Special Care services in order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of children requiring this specialised type of Care.  The first phase of the programme is underway with improvements to facilities in Dublin completed and the extensive refurbishment of the Unit in Limerick also complete.  Planning is well underway for phase 2 of the programme which will double the capacity of the service to 34 beds in early 2016.<\/p><p>  The need to provide Special Care placements outside the jurisdiction into the future cannot be avoided in a very small number of cases in order to ensure the best interests of some children with specialised additional needs.  The referral of children abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.<\/p><p>  The Units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the Agency is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised Units.  The level of requirement of these services for children is closely monitored by the Agency.  Currently there are 17 children in placement in Special Care in HSE Units and 10 children are placed abroad on the basis of High Court Detention Orders. <\/p><p>  ACTS (Assessment, Consultation, Therapeutic Services)  is a new national specialised clinical service which is being developed by the Agency to provide multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs.  These therapeutic inputs are provided in a flexible, timely and responsive manner with a focus on improving outcomes for young people and their families.<\/p><p>  ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes on-site therapeutic services to the national high support, special care units and the children detention schools.  It also provides assessment, consultation and focused intervention services in the community for children at risk of placement in high support, special care or detention.<\/p><p>  ACTS is a multidisciplinary service which includes psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, counselling and social care.  It is supported by contractual sessions from child and forensic psychiatry.  ACTS is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and three heads of discipline whose central responsibility is the implementation of systems of clinical governance.

The nearest available resources, a rapid response vehicle with an advanced paramedic and an emergency ambulance, both in Letterkenny, were dispatched.  As is standard procedure, the NAS also contacted the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, but no emergency resources were available. The response vehicle and ambulance arrived in 40 and 43 minutes respectively.  A second ambulance from Letterkenny arrived in 50 minutes.  The NAS also requested North West Doc and a local GP to provide treatment to the patient, and they were on scene when the NAS crews arrived.  The patient was transported to Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, arriving at 19.15. <\/p><p>  The NAS has reviewed this call and is satisfied that the call was triaged correctly and that the nearest available resources were dispatched.  At the time the call was received there was a high level of utilisation of emergency resources.  In an effort to deal with such situations going forward, the NAS has established an escalation process with Letterkenny General Hospital to ensure that Ambulance Control at Ballyshannon is informed at the earliest opportunity of any capacity, activity or other challenges that may affect NAS service delivery.  <\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority as part of its Business Plan for 2014, and in line with its programme for the monitoring of the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, will review the governance and management arrangements of pre-hospital emergency care services to\u00a0include the timely call-handling, response, assessment, diagnosis,\u00a0care and transportation of\u00a0the acutely ill patient to the appropriate healthcare facility.  This review had been due to commence in the 2nd quarter of 2014.  However, in light of a number of recent incidents, the Authority has agreed to my request to commence the review in quarter 1.  I understand that the review will focus initially on\u00a0the governance arrangements for the service and how those arrangements translate into the safety, quality\u00a0and effectiveness of services for patients. <\/p><p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the NAS will undertake its own capacity review to determine current and future service delivery needs.  This process will examine a number of areas, including staff numbers and skill mix, as well as resource distribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100080#WRZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":1276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100080#WRZ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1277,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[2382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100080#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details of the Health Service Executive voluntary redundancy scheme 2014; the areas and functions to be targeted by the HSE under the scheme; when employees will be able to apply for redundancy under the scheme; and the appropriate procedures by which they can do so.","asker":"1185","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1278,"content":"<p>In 2013 my Department authorised the introduction of a targeted voluntary redundancy facility in the HSE and in organisations funded by the HSE under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004.

Changes to limit the number of people detained and to improve procedures and safeguards regarding their detention were also recommended and the need to strengthen provisions relating to children was also emphasised.<\/p><p>  An Expert Group was subsequently set up in August 2012 to carry out the second and substantive phase of the review and to look at the recommendations of the Interim Report in more detail.

There are no plans to alter these arrangements.<\/p><p>  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure.  These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels.  A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.<\/p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the maximum price at which the HSE reimburses generic products is 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;148 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.  The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply.  In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<\/p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines.  Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.<\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013.  The List has been updated since then by the addition of 10 more groups of medicines.  The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of the top 20 priority medicines by end Quarter 1 2014.  A second list of 20 priority products will then be identified and it is expected the IMB will have completed assessment of these products in Quarter 4 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.<\/p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products is published by the IMB a two stage price reduction process gets underway.  First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1 September 2013.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts.  Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 and the second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014.  The HSE also expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg and rosuvastatin products with effect from 1st February 2014.<\/p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin.  It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014.  The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation.  It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100082#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100082#WRBB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[2646\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100082#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine and fill the vacancy in the early intervention team in north Cork of a psychological therapist (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"979","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>The particular issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1418,"content":"<p>The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines supplied under the community drug schemes since the mid 1990's. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels.<\/p><p>  Price increases have only been allowed under the national pricing agreements in exceptional circumstances.  Approximately 60 products have been granted price increases since 2006. Included in this are essential medicines such as epilepsy medicines and corticosteroids. Price increases are only allowed in extremis  to maintain supplies of required medicines in the Irish market and require the provision of detailed supporting evidence including international pricing.  <\/p><p>  In relation to hydrocortisone, it is appreciated that for an individual patient, the increase in its price is substantial. However, if an increase had not been agreed, the manufacturer was insistent that it would remove the product from the Irish market. If that had occurred, patients would have had to pay for an even more expensive unlicensed product. There is still only a single supplier of hydrocortisone in the Irish market, which suggests that the HSE made the right decision in allowing the price increase in order to maintain supply.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness scheme.<\/p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to reducing both the State&rsquo;s drugs bill and the cost to individuals of their medicines. The Programme for Government therefore gave a commitment to the introduction of reference pricing and the increased use of generics.  <\/p><p>  A number of steps have been taken on foot of this commitment, including: a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.

Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. <\/p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits\/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  By way of example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women). Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for any specific health insurance plan available on the market, irrespective of their age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health, and the plan purchased will include this minimum suite of benefits.  <\/p><p>  Therefore, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific or age-related terms, but rather as a cohort of benefits and procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100083#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100083#WRCC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[2824\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100083#WRCC02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a full list of section 38 bodies; the salaries of chief executive officers; the detail of any top-up payments paid in each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The staff in bodies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act, 2004 are classified as public servants and are subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector as well as having public service pension schemes and being counted in public service employment numbers. Employees of organisations that receive grants from the HSE under Section 39 - the organisations referred to by the Deputy - are not public servants and are not specifically subject to the salary scales approved for public servants.<\/p><p>  However, at my request, the HSE wrote to the CEOs of the 353 Section 39 funded agencies in receipt of HSE funding of more than &euro;250,000 on the 10th December, 2013 asking them to have due regard for overall Government pay policy in respect of the remuneration of their senior managers. The HSE as part of the Service Agreement process for 2014 will require all funded agencies to disclose senior management remuneration and will have systems and processes in place to oversee compliance with this aspect of each funded agency&rsquo;s service agreement.<\/p><p>  The HSE is committed to the development of effective working relationships in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004 and significant progress has been made in improving the governance and management framework between the HSE and voluntary service providers. A Register of Non-Statutory Agencies covering Service Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements is in operation.  This provides information on Agencies and facilitates the maintenance of key information on funding arrangements including compliance with requirements under the HSE's formalised national governance framework to manage the funding provided to voluntary organisations.  This governance documentation was developed in 2009, with the agreement of all major service providers, and came into operation across all sectors in 2010. These Governance Documents ensure a national standard consistent application of good governance and is subject to regular review. <\/p><p>  In 2013 an additional information return was also added to all Service Arrangements, both Section 38 and 39, requiring agencies to separately report on all individual staff paid at Grade 8 level equivalent or above, detailing their salary including allowances and any other benefits paid.

For the Deputies' information,\u00a0\u00a0Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has incurred accumulated losses of &euro;130m in the past five years, a position which is unsustainable.\u00a0<\/p><p>  My Department and the NTA are working with\u00a0Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing rail\u00a0services. \u00a0The Government continues to provide\u00a0substantial\u00a0Exchequer investment in the rail network, in addition to subvention payments\u00a0for Public Service Obligation (PSO) services.\u00a0 There have been reductions in subvention in recent years\u00a0due to pressure on the public finances but I will be\u00a0proposing that there be\u00a0no further cuts to the PSO subvention from 2015.<\/p><p>  Through the NTA, my Department is also funding the use of smart technology to make public transport easier to access and more reliable for the user.\u00a0 Significant progress has been made with the Leap card, Real Time Passenger Information, and the National Journey Planner which maps all public transport services across the country.\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0is important to point out that significant savings can be made by passengers who choose to avail of the integrated ticket, the Leap card.\u00a0 In many cases, passengers will be paying fares that are below 2011\u00a0cash fares when using the Leap card.<\/p><p>  The use of Wi-Fi on trains and buses has also improved the transport experience. \u00a0The NTA will continue to progress these consumer-friendly initiatives which make using public transport more attractive.\u00a0 The public transport experience has improved significantly and that is where we must target our efforts in future. \u00a0I hope that no further reductions in subvention,\u00a0a stabilisation of\u00a0passenger numbers as the economy improves and cost-saving measures in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will mean that future fare increases can be minimised.<\/p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it is in the process of implementing new energy saving fleet utilisation initiatives on its DART and Intercity services to generate fuel savings, which will reduce fuel and maintenance costs by &euro;3.2m per annum.\u00a0Concerns\u00a0about overcrowding have been raised with the Chief Executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand that the company has already responded and re-introduced larger carriages to accommodate passengers where this has been considered necessary.\u00a0 The Chief Executive has agreed to continuous monitoring of carriage levels on both DART and Intercity services to ensure they match passenger demand.<\/p><p>  I am advised that\u00a0carriages were only reduced at off-peak times.  Overcrowding on DART services which has occurred at peak times was caused by other issues including technical faults, industrial relations and leaf falls.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that full loading (involving standing by passengers) is the norm internationally on urban rail systems similar to DART and Commuter services and can be safely accommodated.  The Railway Safety Commission\u00a0(RSC) also met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding DART services and\u00a0is satisfied that corrective measures have and are being taken with regard to crowding on DART.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100084#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Roads Authority Projects","counter":1512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100084#WRDD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1513,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[2410\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012100084#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide traffic usage figures from the latest survey of the N59 road in County Mayo between Ballina and Crossmolina; and the N59 road between Newport and Westport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1514,"content":"<p>The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NRA for direct reply.

It is proposed that a new commercial State company, Shannon Group plc, will be established and that both SAA and Shannon Development will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of that new company.  Both subsidiaries will maintain their separate legal identities, and their assets. While Shannon Development&rsquo;s annual accounts for last year are not yet available, I understand that the company&rsquo;s total income was approximately &euro;12m, of which approximately &euro;8.4m\u00a0 was rental income. Total expenditure by Shannon Development last year was approximately &euro;12.5m.<\/p><p>  One of the priorities arising from the Shannon Task Force report of 2012 was the urgent need to stem the constant fall in passenger numbers at the airport over the previous five years.

Passenger numbers last year were 1.4m, a marginal increase on 2012&rsquo;s figure of 1.39m.
