The Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, thanks the committee for the opportunity to review the Indecon report, provide an update and detail the ongoing development and progress of the industry.  The committee's confirmation of support for the harness racing industry and the IHRA has been noted.  Commenting on the Indecon report, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, recently stated, &quot;I acknowledge the potential of the harness racing sector and we have the basis on which to proceed.&quot;  It was acknowledged in the Seanad last December that this committee &quot;on an all-party basis, has been very supportive of the Irish Harness Racing Association's potential for several years&quot; and that &quot;The agriculture committee continues to support it on an all-party basis&quot;.  The IHRA is grateful for these comments.<br\/><br\/>Following the release of the Indecon report, and more so during the past six weeks, there has been discussion about harness racing going forward and the IHRA's current position on governance, potential and enthusiasm.  One word that has not been mentioned is &quot;expertise&quot;.  There has been talk of the IHRA needing to view things as a beginning, a first chapter and an opportunity to enter into a meaningful relationship.  However, what seems to be forgotten in these conversations is the fact that the IHRA venture in its current standing commenced more than four years ago.  Through business expertise, this venture has moved beyond a beginning, written several chapters on progress and development and forged meaningful relationships with key players both locally and internationally and, most importantly, with Government on an all-party basis.  Enthusiasm has been an important ingredient in driving this venture.  However, enthusiasm alone is of no value if there is not a level of expertise.  It is the IHRA's level of business expertise and acumen that has driven this venture to where we stand today, so much so that Indecon recognises that the IHRA is &quot;at a critical juncture&quot; with &quot;the potential to expand&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Today's presentation is important for all of us because it is the first formal opportunity the IHRA has had to bring everyone up to speed on the progress and development of the industry over a period that extends beyond the past 12 months.  It is now 12 months since the IHRA completed its engagement with Indecon and eight months since the report was delivered to the Department.  These past 12 months have seen major developments that will continue the ongoing progress toward a successful and vibrant harness racing industry.<br\/><br\/>Included in these major developments was the successful Pari Mutuel Urbain, PMU, meeting that took place in June 2017.  This was the first Irish harness race meeting to be broadcast and bet on in France, which is globally the largest harness racing market.  The meeting was conducted in Dundalk and its significance as a milestone cannot be overestimated not just for the sport, but also for Ireland.  Turnover in France on the four races amounted to &euro;750,000.  The feedback from the PMU and Le Trot was that this meeting performed well ahead of budget and received a better response than other racing normally held at that time of day.  Significantly, across all racing codes - thoroughbred, greyhound and harness - this meeting provided commissions higher than ever previously received for Ireland from tote wagering.  I ask the committee to keep this statistic in mind as this was only the first Irish harness meeting ever broadcast and wagered on in France.  In the context of the turnover that was achieved on this meeting, the Indecon report provides a key insight into the difficulty now being faced by the IHRA.  Indecon states:<\/p><blockquote>[T]here is potential for the harness racing sector to expand significantly and to enhance its economic contribution but we note there are significant barriers to development which the sector faces.  These include the absence of suitable track facilities to televise meetings and this is inhibiting the growth of the sector.  If the potential of the sector is to be realised there is a need for increased investment.<\/blockquote> <p>Indecon also notes, &quot;Unlike for thoroughbred racing, there is currently no contribution to prizemoney from the Irish Government.&quot;  One of the returns on investment Indecon notes for horse owners is linked to prize money.  Using its own initiative, the IHRA has delivered more than a threefold increase in the aggregate prize money on offer since 2013, or a cumulative 49% per annum growth for the past three years.  In 2017, total harness racing prize money amounted to &euro;685,000.  This year, the IHRA is budgeting industry turnover in the region of &euro;1 million.  In total, thoroughbred and greyhound racing received a budgetary appropriation of &euro;80 million, for which greyhound racing's portion was &euro;16 million.  I reiterate that the IHRA was able to achieve more international tote commission revenue from just one race meeting being broadcast internationally than the other two racing codes have generated.  This was achieved with no financial support from the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to the key points from the Indecon report, the first recommendation states, &quot;Responsibility for the operation of the Harness Racing industry in Ireland should be vested in the IHRA.&quot;  I am pleased to announce the operation of Irish Harness Racing is now centralised in the IHRA.  This means that all decisions regarding all aspects of the industry, including capital and other expenditure, are determined by the board of the IHRA, with all income accruing to the IHRA.  In addition, the operation and management of racetracks and races will move from the individual clubs to the IHRA.  Therefore, the first recommendation has been completed.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation states, &quot;Indecon are fully supportive of IHRA plans to enhance their corporate governance to align with best practice.&quot;  Regarding governance, Indecon stated:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he governance structures at the commencement of this review were not developed as yet to an adequate level to align with the best practice.  However, this is accepted by the IHRA and they have set out how they propose to restructure the industry and governance reflecting the growing scale of activity.<\/blockquote> <p>The key point to note here is that Indecon specifies &quot;at the commencement of this review&quot;, not at the end of or during it.<\/p><p>What is more Indecon said that the IHRA accepted this view and furthermore set out &quot;how they propose to restructure the industry and governance reflecting the growing scale of activity&quot;.  For the entirety of 2017, the IHRA set about addressing the matters of governance.  It can report that recommendations provided by Indecon for early implementation of IHRA plans to enhance its corporate governance to align with best practice have been progressively adopted over the past 12 months.  We can confirm that the following items identified within the report have been addressed: expanding the skills of the board, including the appointment of new independent directors; enhancing risk management and control, including establishing an order and risk committee; implementing and monitoring a risk register; establishing enhanced internal controls and checks; and ensuring the IHRA board operates in accordance with best practice governance and procedures.  Board size has increased, with greater levels of experience and expertise being identified and brought in, while board training has been ongoing.  Sub-committees are being established and have been put in place thereby enhancing internal controls and checks.  It is also important to note, as Indecon has done, that corporate governance for the IHRA is not something that is only beginning to be addressed with the release of this report.  Corporate governance has been going on for the IHRA over the past four years.  Abiding by practices of corporate governance has been a standard for IHRA through the entire journey.<br\/><br\/>This was a prerequisite when engaging in forging its relationship with Le Trot.  The IHRA is now entrusted with the oversight of hundreds of thousands of euros each year, managing prize money subsidies from France.  To be admitted to the Union of European Trotting, UET, the IHRA had to undergo vigorous audit requirements.  Upon successful completion of this audit, full membership was then granted.  The following point is also critical: for the IHRA to have its races broadcast and wagered on globally in many nations, integrity and governance need to be in place and at an international optimal level.  Indecon has not said that the IHRA is not fit for purpose in its current form.  It has recommended that responsibility for the operation of the harness racing industry in Ireland should be vested in the IHRA.  This has been achieved and &quot;Indecon are fully supportive of IHRA plans to enhance their corporate governance to align with best practice&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I would like to discuss other aspects of the Indecon report.  The report has proved to be a wonderful resource for the IHRA to measure progress and to identify what still needs to be done.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has highlighted: <\/p><blockquote>[The Department]... commissioned the report in good faith and we recognise the potential of the IHRA to become the kind of body with which we can engage in a structured way and into which we confidently invest taxpayers' money...  The Indecon report provides for that so we have that basis on which to proceed.<\/blockquote><p>It is for this reason that the IHRA has identified the delivery of the report to the Minister in May as a milestone in the four year journey and a matter of significance in the past 12 months pointing towards the exciting future of the industry.  The IHRA is now working toward addressing the five recommendations identified as within the report and accepts the position of the Minister when he says: &quot;Our only requirement is that the IHRA now deliver on the Indecon requirements.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 5 states: &quot;Indecon recommends that the pilot integration programme implemented should continue.&quot;  Indecon also states: &quot;To help address this issue [of road racing], the IHRA developed a horse appreciation and education programme which was given Government funding, and was run in 2016. The purpose of this initiative was to offer a horse and welfare education programme to those who are 'road-racing'.&quot;  The first pilot programme was very successful.  However, for the project to be sustainable over the long term appropriate facilities and infrastructure are necessary.  This was made abundantly clear when several graduates expressed their frustration in 2016 that after having successfully completed the course, there were no facilities available for them to continue and to reinforce what they had learned.  This meant they could not buy a horse as there were no training or stabling facilities available for use.  Importantly Indecon also makes this point: &quot;Effects [<i>sic<\/i>] should also be made to encourage past-programme participants to engage in the sport.&quot;  The IHRA wants a successful training programme to encourage people to be integrated into harness racing.  Unless the appropriate training and racetrack facilities are in place, this education and integration programme will fail to achieve its key objective and purpose.<br\/><br\/>The report also highlighted that the Government has previously supported several urban horse projects that involved in one case an allocation of &euro;2.25 million.  This was in contrast to the relatively low cost of the IHRA pilot programme of &euro;22,000, which was entrusted to the IHRA by the Department.  The Minister stated in December that &quot;As a signal of good faith, we are committing in the region of &euro;50,000 to the Irish Harness Racing Association for 2018 as a continuation and expansion of the pilot project&quot;.  This goodwill gesture by the Minister is appreciated, but more important is the question of whether it would assist in, or contribute to, resolving the road racing social issue.  It is the belief of the IHRA that equal to providing those funds is the execution of those moneys.<br\/><br\/>The IHRA knows that it is pointless handing over funds if they do not deliver on the targets being set here.  Unless there is a racing venue and training facilities the integration programme cannot succeed in being all that it needs to be.  The IHRA will identify the needs of this programme in its five year strategy document.  However, until these infrastructure matters for a post-integration programme are addressed, the IHRA does not want to use and in turn waste public money on a programme that cannot deliver the long-term benefits for which it was designed.  The IHRA looks forward to working with the Minister and his Department.  However, the only way there can be true public gain is by addressing this appropriately and thoroughly.  Within the recommendations Indecon concludes: &quot;The Harness Racing industry in Ireland is now at a critical juncture. Previous experience of other countries... [has] shown that there is the potential to expand, and an expansion may also be achievable in Ireland.&quot;  The IHRA knows that to prepare a comprehensive five year strategy plan requires certain processes to be undertaken.  These processes will take several months to complete before being ready for presentation.<br\/><br\/>At present, the IHRA is formulating a programme to ensure stakeholders, members and other interested parties are engaged in the consultation process.  The IHRA is keen to have all voices heard.  Included in the strategic plan process is the evaluation of racetrack development.  This will need to occur before State funding can be forthcoming.  The IHRA recognises and appreciates the requirements of this process.  However, it also notes this will inhibit its international market development and the integration programme.  The remaining recommendation from the Indecon report states:<\/p><blockquote>The Board of IHRA should identify a funding programme to support the expansion of the sector including the role of Exchequer seed funding for the sector. <br \/><br \/>THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME SEED FUNDING FOR THE SECTOR... <\/blockquote><p>The IHRA board is preparing a document that identifies the seed funding requirements to support the expansion of the sector.  This is a costed programme, as required by the Indecon report, identifying the areas of expenditure.  This will be prepared over the next weeks and will be available.  The IHRA accepts that this seed funding is provided on a pilot basis and its results will be evaluated before further funding, in other words, State funding is considered.  The key areas for the seed funding allocation are process costs for the preparation of the five-year strategy plan; legacy expenses incurred in preparation of the Indecon report; UET audit, governance and membership; Le Trot and France negotiations; international representation on committees; governance and governance training expenses; data development to an acceptable international level; and maintaining and enhancing the welfare and integrity of racing.  The Indecon report states that the IHRA does not currently have employees or significant resources.  At present, there is no confirmed amount for seed funding being requested nor is there an indication within the Indecon report that this seed funding is conditional on the IHRA delivering a five-year strategic plan.  They are two separate items within the Indecon report.<\/p><p> Recommendation 4 of the report makes the distinction between State and seed funding and, collectively, we all must do the same.<\/p><p> The IHRA achieved many milestones during the past four years.  We will continue to deliver during 2018 and we hope the Department, the Minister and the committee will continue to support us.  We hope a realistic amount of seed funding is appropriated to the IHRA in the coming month to ensure it can deliver to the Department and Minister the strategic plan that is necessary to ensure State funding is forthcoming.<\/p><p> Indecon has indicated that expansion of the sector is possible and that both seed and State funding should be considered.  This month two years ago, in 2016, the committee released its report.  On that occasion there was a recommendation that the IHRA receive appropriate funding to develop the sport of harness racing from an increased funding stream.  Today, we know the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department are on board, as are all parties.  The IHRA is ready to do the work to deliver.  As the Minister, Deputy Creed, has said, the Department has stated it has a fund and a document on which it can make progress.  Let us all make progress in 2018 and let us begin by providing the IHRA with an appropriate seed funding allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cooper for a very comprehensive analysis of the Indecon report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That was a very comprehensive presentation, as we are used to receiving from Mr. Cooper.

The IHRA has done things very well.  For a body starting up and in embryo stage, it has done things exceptionally well.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cooper spoke about the seed funding required by the IHRA.  He veered away from the major question, which is exactly how much money we are speaking about.  Mr. Cooper spoke about prize money.  How much prize money per race was given by the IHRA last year?  Mr. Cooper spoke about percentage and spoke about prize money increasing by 38%, but 38% of a small figure could still be a small amount of money.  How much prize money will the IHRA require if this is to be put on a proper footing?  We have a formula between Horse Racing Ireland and the Greyhound Board, which is 4:1 with regard to the distribution of Exchequer funding.  Horse Racing Ireland is of the strong view that an increase in betting tax could make this self-financing.  The IHRA probably has the same view, that if it could get its business up and running it could make it self-financing.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Cooper put flesh on what he is saying?  Committee members have met the witnesses on a number of occasions at this stage, and the IHRA has convinced us it is capable of doing the job.  It has convinced me that it is capable of doing it well.  The IHRA is at a crossroads now, as the &euro;50,000 that was provided is not enough to get it to the next stage.  How much money is required to get race meetings up and running properly and have tote pools which, in turn, will be self-financing and will allow harness racing to progress to the next stage with regard to providing its own circuit and race track?  Accommodation and the housing of ponies and horses is also essential for the business.  Mr. Cooper balked from stating the exact amount of money required to get the IHRA to the next stage.  It has done tremendously well and has convinced us it is doing everything by the book and correctly.  I am confident that everything is covered with regard to regulations and testing horses, and it is essential that this is done.  I would like more flesh on exactly what is needed to get the IHRA to the next stage.  It would be a shame, given all the work the IHRA has done, if it is left floundering.  If another 12 months goes by, it will be 12 months wasted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Similar to other committee members, I have been very impressed by the professionalism and enthusiasm of the IHRA in my interactions with it.  This is why it has had the all-party support of the committee for quite a number of years.  That commitment has probably strengthened over time.  The concern has been that the IHRA has also won the admiration and support of the international organisation and it receives substantial investment from other states but, unfortunately, this has not been matched by our own.  I hope this is about to change significantly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Indecon report, I will zoom in on its fourth recommendation and the issue of State seed funding.  It states State seed funding could be provided on a pilot basis and its impacts evaluated before any further funding is considered.  This is the key phrase, if we get to the nub of the issue.  Obviously, the &euro;50,000 for the integration programme will continue.  As Mr. Cooper stated, more than &euro;2 million has been invested by the State.  That is a separate issue.  It is very important because we had a very detailed exchange with the Minister.  I welcome the fact the Minister explicitly stated he supports what the IHRA is trying to do and he acknowledged his confidence in the organisation.  It appears to me from everything he said that he supports Indecon's recommendations.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that he appeared to state the IHRA needed to have a five year plan before it could get any funding outside the &euro;50,000 integration fund.  It is very important that the committee locks down this issue today.  To be very fair, I am conscious no profit is being made by the IHRA and it is purely about passion and professionalism.  We are taking liberties to expect the IHRA to keep doing this and certainly to expect it to implement the very reasonable recommendations, particularly in terms of safeguarding public investment.  We know there have been problems with regard to the funding received by other greyhound and horse racing organisations.  There have been corporate management issues and we do not want these repeated.  These are reasonable recommendations.  I welcome the fact the IHRA has totally embraced them, but there is only a certain amount it can do to implement them without seed funding.  It is critical that we deal with this today and that the committee continues to ask that the Minister-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is a phone or device causing interference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I apologise.

It is comprehensive as usual.  I wish to consider the Indecon report and what has been done since.  There was a long period during which the report was not published.  However, notwithstanding it not being published, a fair amount was still known about what might be in it.  I refer in particular to the context of governance structures.  Has attention been paid to the recommendations pertaining to governance structures?  I refer especially to the appointment of additional non-executive directors.  Has the IHRA set about the establishment of the five sub-committees?  The various aspects of welfare and integrity and stakeholders are all very important, as is an audit and risk committee .  In terms of public moneys, as the IHRA will appreciate, it is important that all those elements are in place.  We have no doubt that the IHRA is deeply committed and very professional in its outlook.  We also have no doubt, from our interactions and representations even today, that the IHRA will ensure full compliance with all of the technical, health and safety, audit and risk and various other requirements associated with sport.  We have had other sporting participants where we have had to ensure that various legislation is amended to bring them up to speed.<\/p> <p>  The critical point, as noted by Senator Mac Lochlainn, is whether the IHRA is being coy about indicating what level of seed funding is required in the context of the recommendation of the Indecon report.  Can the IHRA say we need &euro;300,000 or &euro;500,000 or whatever it is?  It has been indicated that a certain level of seed funding would be forthcoming and that would be subject to evaluation to see how things are getting on.  While we may never be at the French level, in the context of our population, for the IHRA to take off, grow and develop, what is needed to attract bigger attendances?<\/p> <p>  How many races have taken place in 2017 in Ireland?  There were 11,000 or 12,000 in France but how many can we showcase to ensure that opportunities for expansion and growth are going to be available?  Prize money is a big issue and the witnesses have spoken of parimutuel betting and the potential income streams that arise from that.  Can that be explained in more detail?<\/p> <p>  Facilities for racing are important.  As the witnesses said, two years ago we were on a committee that made recommendations and probably opened the door slightly ajar for them to get through.  How are things going at that level in respect of racecourses?  Dundalk was important but is any other racecourse now becoming more amenable to the IHRA proposals?  In regard to the potential for television coverage, where does that fit in?  What level of income and media rights are associated with this particular sport?  Is it the equivalent of what is available at the Horse Racing Ireland level in terms of the ordinary courses across the country?  <\/p> <p>  A breeding programme has been initiated.  Could the potential numbers involved and the opportunity to expand significantly be outlined?  There is a diversionary programme, as I call it, for road racing, which is important.  It takes people off the roads and away from the dangers associated with that.  Some moneys have been invested in getting that up and running.  The crucial question for us is what level of investment is required to ensure that harness racing reaches its potential?  That is important.  The first step is establishing what level of seed funding is required.<\/p> <p>  Does the IHRA attract sponsorship for racing and if so, to what level?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#L00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Going back to Deputy Cahill's initial question about the percentage that we receive from the PMU, the international standard rate of 3% is what we receive.  That is basically what the figure is anywhere around the world when dealing with major totalisators.  Of that &euro;750,000 turnover achieved in France, we receive 3% in commissions on that.<\/p> <p>  With harness racing, there is probably more a propensity towards having a totalisator than towards fixed odds bookmakers.  That said, in Australia there is a move away from the totalisator towards more bookmakers.  We look towards bookmakers as being an opportunity.  I am in negotiations with a number of operators globally from a trotting perspective or from a harness racing perspective.  We are trying to come up with appropriate arrangements.  The longer-term aim with these deals being put in place at present is to incorporate Ireland in that.  That will be right across Europe.  When it comes to the PMU, which is the big one in the world, 3% is the turnover there.  <\/p> <p>  The governance side of things was mentioned.  A fair portion of what we are looking towards with regards to seed funding - we will come on to a figure on that in a moment - is on enhancing the whole governance side.  I will start on the sub-committees, which I think everyone has brought up thus far.  One key thing we need to do concerns the internal side of things.  We now have in place five sub-committees.  We have breeding, racecourse, integration, stakeholders and welfare and integrity sub-committees.  Three of those sub-committees will have open floor membership.  Members and stakeholders can apply to be part of those committees.  That includes the racecourse along with the stakeholders sub-committees.  They can apply to be on there and we want to have representation from our stakeholders on those committees.  <\/p> <p>  All committees will have a minimum of two IHRA board members.  The chairmen of each of those sub-committees will be an IHRA board member, so it will funnel up to the main IHRA board.  We have brought in independent directors to the audit and finance and risk sub-committee and they primarily make up that particular committee along with two members of the IHRA board.  That includes audit, finance and risk, so we are enhancing ourselves in that area.  <\/p> <p>  We consider the welfare and integrity committee to be probably equal with the audit and finance committee as the most important of the committees.  With that particular committee, we have brought in a number of experts from around Ireland.  We have veterinary surgeons, we have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There are four independent people on that and three IHRA directors.

It wants to support us.  This support was in order to give us more meetings.  I will come onto that in just a moment.  With regard to the betting tax, of course we would also like to partake.  One of the issues which we have always faced, and on which we have always argued, is that the betting tax goes to the greyhounds and the thoroughbreds.  While it is not a huge amount, a portion of betting still takes place on harness racing here in Ireland and we do not see any of the tax on it.  We believe that we are entitled to some form of remuneration from that betting tax.  With the plans I have in place, and in negotiation with the various operators, I would like to think that we can increase the share of and entitlement to the betting tax for harness racing once we get the track and everything up and running.<\/p> <p>  Does that answer the committee's questions?  There was one other thing I was going to say on the governance side of things.  With the sub-committees now in place, and with things like the governance training and so on, we want to have a pyramid.  We have the board and then the sub-committees, which report up to it.  The board has already undergone training over the last 12 months.  We saw Indecon 12 months ago.  It outlined areas we needed to look at.  We have looked at them.  Board members have now had formal training.  We intend to give them more.  The board members have to fund all this training themselves in order to get themselves up to a certain level.  From there, we realised that the sub-committees were also in need of governance because they play very important parts and roles within their various disciplines and consequently, will also need corporate governance training.  The whole governance issue is very important and it is to the forefront of what we seek to enhance.  We believe that if we get the governance right then a lot of things will flow from there. <\/p> <p>  The bringing on of independent directors was a recommendation.  We brought them on six or eight months ago.  They are independent directors with expertise in specific areas including the areas of audit and finance, and governance.  That is the situation with regard to governance.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?<\/p> <p>  Moving on to Senator Mac Lochlainn, Mr. Flanagan just touched on the French matching funds, which are really important.  This year alone Le Trot will give &euro;192,000.  This amount has increased over recent years.  France has been very generous to us and supports us in a very big way through subsidised horses and prize money subsidies.  Instead of the stakeholders racing for &euro;500 or &euro;700, all of a sudden they are racing for &euro;2,000.  Therefore they are encouraged to get more horses.  What does that mean in turn?  Those horses have to be fed, they have to be shod and they have veterinary issues.  There is a flow-on effect within the economy from the money which France gives to us for that prize money subsidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>There were 370 horses raced in Ireland last year.

It questions us when we keep telling it that the Government is very supportive because it is not seeing anything in return for its support.  It wants us to succeed.  We will touch on the breeding in a moment but the French have put a lot of money in and are asking when they will get a return.<\/p> <p>  On the meeting with PMU, we have another meeting coming up in June of this year.  We are getting five races.  We are projecting more than &euro;1 million in turnover for that particular meeting.  We did not get any more meetings this year.  Looking at the history of how the French bodies have normally operated, we would have expected a couple of extra meetings this year.  We did not get any this year.  I suspect one of the reasons for that is that, having supported us this far, they are starting to question how much more support they must give before they get a return.  I anticipate that if this meeting goes well and if we progress in the next 12 months, we will get a couple more meetings next year.  Within the next five years we are aiming to have between 20 and 25 meetings a year.  These would include seven or eight races.  We would have turnover of between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million per race meeting from France on those 25 meetings.  All of a sudden we would be getting revenue of &euro;3 million.  It is not that far away.  We can achieve revenue of over &euro;3 million in commissions from France if the structures are in place and if France sees that we are prepared to assist it, because it has assisted us.  The matching of France's support is very important.  Other nations have also been very supportive.  Australia has supported us and was very generous in its comments in the Indecon report on what we have achieved so far.<\/p> <p>  Recommendations 4 and 5 were also mentioned.  They are two separate recommendations and, unfortunately, I think they have been melded together in previous conversations.  As Senator Mac Lochlainn rightly points out, the issues of seed funding and State funding are totally different.  The IHRA agrees with the Indecon report in that State funding can only come once we have prepared the strategic plan.  We accept that in the first instance but, as Indecon has stated, we should be entitled to some form of seed funding.  It now comes down to what we are doing to justify that seed funding.  We are in the process of putting that document together.  It is not far away from completion.  I will be distributing a copy to everybody before it goes out.  The five or six points I have mentioned will be spelt out within it.  Last year we were talking about &euro;770,000.  We are waiting for some final tenders to come back.  I cannot actually give a final figure but it will not come in at &euro;770,000.  However, we anticipate - and we will justify this - that we will probably be looking for between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 in seed funding to get us over the line and to deliver between now and August.  A lot of time and effort will be spent on the strategic plan this year.  We understand it is the most important thing.  <\/p> <p>  While we would love to have Portmarnock developed tomorrow if we could, we accept the process that needs to take place.  We recognise that it will not happen this year.  First we must have the strategic plan in place which, as I have said, will take a number of months to conclude.  That strategic plan will outline the proper development, what we want from a track and stabling facility, and the justification as to why it will cost a given sum of money.  That is what the full amount will be.  In the short term I anticipate that the seed funding will be between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  After that, we expect it will take a couple of million euro to develop the track and stabling.  <\/p> <p>  That then leads on to the training or integration programme.  If we go ahead and use the &euro;50,000 this year, it will end up like the situation two years ago.  Some of the graduates from that time are drivers now and some have a driver's licence.  All bar two graduates of that initial programme from two years ago came to a little lunch we held for them to celebrate up at Dundalk.  They said they really got a lot out of the programme and would like to race a horse but they had nowhere to stable or train.  Were the track to be developed I would be able to put it out internationally immediately, because there are a number of markets out there that would take us tomorrow.<\/p><p> After meeting several years ago, our interlocutors in Australia have said that if we held meetings there, and raced at certain times, they would put us on straight away.  There are markets that will take us.  It is not just a matter of having an international track.  We envision merging the two together with the integration programme.  It can constitute the use of State funding for two very important areas.<\/p><p> We want to get this programme up and running.  We want to do it around the country.  However, we do not want to waste public money if there is no follow-up.  As Indecon point out, there should be a follow-up programme.  If that is not in place, why go ahead and do it?  Let us get everything done correctly.  In the strategic plan we will devote a full section to the integration programme, the way believe it should operate and how it can benefit the country going forward.  We need to keep State funding and seed funding very separate.  We met with representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine just prior to the publication of the Indecon report.  Since then, we have been in regular communication with them via email.  With Christmas and new year over,  we will be meeting the Department tomorrow.  We will discuss what seed capital will be required and explain that we have now completed the report's first recommendation.  We are completing the second recommendation, but that will be an ongoing process.  We will discuss training, integration and our reasons for thinking that the sum of &euro;50,000 should not be spent at this point.  We will also explain how the strategic plan should come together and will be required of the Department<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose asked how many race meetings are held.

We want to develop this breeding industry so that in a decade it will be something of which Ireland can be very proud.<\/p> <p>  Dundalk Stadium was mentioned.  That concern has been very generous to us.  It is the only racetrack in Ireland that we are using, apart from Portmarnock Raceway and some locations in the North.  We also race on grass.  We use Dundalk Stadium for the LeTrot PMU premium meeting.  Hopefully they will be kind enough to come to some arrangement with us.  I do not want to go into financial details here, but that commission is very nice, with a 3% headline on that turnover of &euro;750,000.  However, there is significant expense in using a third-party racetrack for which payment is required.  If we had our own track we would not have to pay rent.  The cost-benefit breakdown of renting is one of the reasons we did not push as hard as we could have for conditional PMU meetings.  Dundalk is a great site and looks very well on television.  When I was in Paris last year I watched the meeting, and both Dundalk and Ireland came across very well.  They put together a very good programme.  I would award full marks to Dundalk Stadium.

We have met many times, and to cut to the nub of it, I am a firm believer in priming the pump.  If we want any industry to start and to function, we have to invest in it during the initial stages and get it to the stage where it can continue on its own, hopefully generating a return.  That must happen with this industry.<\/p> <p>  As well as meeting with our witnesses, I have looked into what happens in France and other countries.  I am aware of how large this industry is, how much money it makes and how well it is doing.  I agree that there seems to be real potential here.  This sport has an added social value in that it takes these people off the roads.  It reduces the anti-social element which many people associate with harness racing.  That can be turned on its head, creating something very positive.  Huge kudos would result from the Government investing money for that return.  Over time that investment will come back in spades. <\/p> <p>  I give full credit to the witnesses for the work they have done.  The five recommendations of the Indecon report are very clear.  The witnesses appear to have gone a long way towards fulfilling the parts of those recommendations which fall to them, even if, considering the circumstances, they have not gone all the way.  The remaining requirements concern the seed funding.  State funding is vital.  In 2016 Sport Ireland invested in a range of organisations.  Basketball Ireland received &euro;588,000 that year, while Cricket Ireland received &euro;355,000.  A total of &euro;10 million was awarded to a range of very small, niche sports across the country.  Harness racing is something which can generate a return and can be developed into an industry which would contribute to the economy.  Many of these sports will not do that.  That does not mean they are not worthy.  They are clearly very worthy of every penny they get.  However, this would allow the Government to invest in order to create something which will give something back.  The work the witnesses have done is very worthwhile, and I think all the members of the committee that have heard this presentation, and those who have met with the witnesses separately, would agree.<\/p><p>All the people on the committee have heard the witnesses and met them outside of this meeting and they would feel we can, as a committee, recommend to the Minister and the Department that the &euro;500,000 - rather than the &euro;400,000 - that the witnesses say they need right now would be money well spent.  It would be a proper investment.  Further down the road there is talk of needing much larger sums and we would have to look at that when the time comes.  It would be worth doing that if we can see this is about establishing something and specifically an industry that would create a return.<\/p><p>I have been quite critical in the past of many industries and groupings in the country getting large amounts of money every year who seem to be doing very well but continue to need State funding.  It is important to state at the beginning that there must be a stage when the State must pull back from groups of this nature.  We need to say that these guys have been propped up and kept going for so long and there comes a time when the State must pull back a little and say we cannot continue it forever.  Those groups must find their way in developing an industry that would pay for itself.<\/p><p> Looking at international examples and as far as I can see, harness racing has the potential to become self-sustainable but it will not do so unless we invest in it initially.  I fully endorse the comments of the witnesses and the plan put forward.  I assume the five-year plan would be fully costed and it would set out a stage-by-stage process outlining how this would become sustainable.  The committee should recommend to the Minister and the Department that the seed funding of &euro;500,000 should be found in order to bring us to the next stage.  We should have confidence to do that as a committee at this point.  I wish the witnesses all the best and I hope the money will be spent very wisely.  I hope not too many people will get a big salary or attend junkets.  I am sure that would not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#N00800","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I know this matter has been discussed well by previous speakers and in the responses to the questions.

We do not have the capacity at committee level to allocate funding but it is crucial to see a pathway that can be developed quickly being established between the association and the Department so as to ensure ongoing engagement and bring us to the stage where the seed funding can be promptly delivered.

This would be an investment for the industry's future.  The strategic plan will be fully costed and it will include the cost of redeveloping Portmarnock or a new track.  That is what we are working towards.

If we can do it around the country in a progressive fashion and there is an ability to get horses, training programmes and a training track under the one umbrella, in the long term it will succeed.  We have always argued that Europe does not have this problem because there is an established trotting industry, with an amateur driver side of things.  There are equivalent operations in France, for example, who can race at meetings.  From a longer-term perspective, we can make a difference, although this will not happen overnight.  The return on investment will very much be part of that strategic plan.  With the seed funding document we will list what we are looking for and where the economic benefits on that side will be included.  As we have noted, we believe there is a massive opportunity for this country on the breeding side.<\/p> <p>  How big can harness racing be for Ireland?  One must remember that on mainland Europe, this is the number one horse racing sport.  It is bigger than racing thoroughbreds.  Even if we just steadily increase the numbers, from a breeding perspective we could become the supplier to Europe in the long term.  That is where we see a big opportunity.  From a racing perspective, we would love to say we could be self-sustaining as quickly as possible but that will only come about when we have international meetings and domestic betting.<\/p><p> We were lucky enough a couple of years ago to have Satellite Information Services, SIS, in the UK cover our meetings and bookmakers were given an opportunity in that context.  I look at schedules around the world to identify where there is an opportunity.  Last year, one country said it needed trotting at certain times of the day and asked if we could supply it.  I am looking for opportunities to sell our product and get our 3% back on that turnover so that we can be as self-sustaining as possible once the initial investment in the industry has been made.  The development of the racing side and the international and integration programme can come together with the overall investment from the State.  The long-term strategic plan will spell that out.  The Indecon report is very clear in its statement on seed funding to the effect that the latter should be totally separate from State funding and that we should be entitled to it.<\/p><p> I like to think that we have developed a very good relationship with the Department over the three or four years we have been visiting it.  There are some very understanding staff there who get what the horse racing industry involves and we have had some good conversations with them.  The last time we were in there was a few days before the Indecon report came out.  We did not realise it was coming out so soon.  We had a very open discussion about the funding that is needed.  This was followed by the Indecon report coming out.  Then there was the 21 November session, then the debate in the Seanad and then it was Christmas.  We wanted to see officials from the Department in December but the timetables did not work out.  The Department suggested early January when we were next over.  I said we would be coming to this meeting and the Department suggested we get together after this session.  We will be meeting the Department's representatives tomorrow.  We hope a roadmap will be put forward of what it needs in order for us to be able to move forward and go through the five recommendations.  It is not just a question of horse racing.  Animal welfare must also be considered and we have met the relevant officials.  They are the ones we approached about the integration programme.  I have been in contact with them this year on how to move forward with that.  We hope the Department's door is open so that we can meet on a monthly or bimonthly basis and update it on our progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Over the past three years, the stakeholders of the IHRA have invested up to &euro;1 million in horses to get us to this point.

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Anna Donegan, Mr. John Palmer, Mr. Kevin Nolan and Mr. Faris Bader, who are all from the Department of Finance.  My understanding is that the committee wishes to discuss the revaluation of properties for the purposes of the local property tax, LPT, and the yield from the increase in stamp duty on non-residential property.  My statement will address each of these in turn. <\/p> <p>  The LPT is an annually recurring tax applying to most residential properties owned on a specific liability date.  The tax is currently linked to the market value of the property as at 1 May 2013.  The legislative basis for LPT is the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended.  The Revenue Commissioners have operational responsibility for the administration of the LPT and the tax has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners since it commenced.  This continues to be the case.  Between 2014 and the end of last year, Revenue remitted LPT to the Exchequer and an equivalent amount was paid over to the local government fund by the Minister for Finance for onward distribution to the 31 local authorities by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As of the start of this year, the Revenue Commissioners are remitting LPT directly to the local government fund under reforms provided for the Water Services Act 2017.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has responsibility for LPT allocations to local authorities from the local government fund. <\/p> <p>  The local property tax has broadened the domestic tax base and provided a new source of revenue for local authorities to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.  Our reliance in the past on transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable foundation for Government revenue.  In contrast, the experience internationally has been that property taxes provide a stable and secure source of funding.  The LPT is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities, although both yields and rates are modest by international standards.  The charging structure for LPT is progressive.  The basic rate of 0.18% applies up to property values of &euro;1 million with a higher rate of 0.25% applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold.  At the end of 2017 and since its inception, LPT has contributed over &euro;2 billion to the funding of local authorities. <\/p> <p>  From 1 January 2015, elected members of local authorities have had discretion to vary the LPT rates by plus or minus 15%.  If a local authority decides to reduce the LPT rate, it forgoes the equivalent amount of the reduced LPT yield from its allocation.  If a local authority votes to increase the LPT rate above the basic rate, it receives the full amount of the increased yield.  We understand that seven local authorities voted to increase their LPT above the basic rate in 2018 and that four have decided on a reduced rate. <\/p> <p>  The introduction of the LPT in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State, with over 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file LPT returns and pay the tax in respect of around 1.9 million properties.  The first valuation date was 1 May 2013.  The valuations declared for that date determined tax liabilities for 2013 - a half year - 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes to November 2019.  The postponement to November 2019 of the revaluation date for LPT means that homeowners were not be faced with significant increases in their LPT for 2017, 2018 and 2019 as a result of increased property values. <\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners publish comprehensive LPT statistics on a quarterly and annual basis, which include information in relation to collection and compliance, exemptions and deferrals, and payment types.  Some of this is broken down by local authority.  The compliance rate for 2017 is currently 97%, which is line with rates in previous years. <\/p> <p>  Given its importance and conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and potential effects on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the previous Minister for Finance engaged Dr. Don Thornhill in 2015 to conduct a review of the operation of the LPT.  The review focussed in particular on any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments.  The terms of reference for the 2015 review required that it also have regard to the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue on an ongoing basis and the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.<\/p> <p>  The central recommendation of Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s 2015 review was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance is now advancing consideration of issues relating to the implementation of the remaining recommendations in the 2015 Thornhill LPT review report in line with the 2019 revaluation timeline.  We welcome the opportunity to hear the views of committee members in relation to LPT and we look forward to the report of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations which will inform our own work.  Following the completion of the Department&rsquo;s work, recommendations will be put to the Minister for Finance who intends to make the future position on LPT clear so that households will know well advance of November 2019 what the Government&rsquo;s plans are for the LPT.   It is important to note that the Minister for Finance has reiterated the importance of the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT, that is, achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer term.  This principle will inform our current consideration of this matter.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2018 included a change to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, which was projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 included a change to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, which was projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.  This was based on estimates in Revenue&rsquo;s pre-budget ready reckoner, which showed the effect of a 0.5% increase in the rate on non-residential property to be a &euro;47 million increase in yield &ndash; this is multiplied up to &euro;94 million for a 1% increase or &euro;376 million for a 4% increase.<\/p><p> We understand from Revenue that the yield projection for 2018 was based on receipts for previous years, combined with an ongoing assessment of expected receipts by the end of 2017 and for 2018, as well as impacts of earlier policy changes.  This process includes assessment of significant once-off transactions that positively increased 2016 receipts but which were not expected to recur on a regular basis.  Failure to account for these one-off transactions would have led to a higher estimate for 2018.  The estimate is therefore considered to be conservative and prudent.<\/p><p> Following budget 2018, Revenue updated the ready reckoner to a post-budget basis, taking account of budgetary changes and revised growth forecasts from the Department for 2018. The post-budget ready reckoner indicates that each 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;49 million increase in the overall yield.  This would indicate that the estimated additional yield from the increase in stamp duty rate on non-residential property could be in the region of &euro;392 million rather than &euro;376 million.  In the absence of precise and accurate forecasts for transaction volumes in 2018, basing receipts on 2016-17 levels and trends is the most reasonable option.  The estimate also assumes current exemptions and other reliefs remain unchanged.<\/p><p> We are advised by Revenue that, adjusting for possible one-off transactions in 2016, receipts in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 were quite stable and Revenue's assessment is that it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue.<\/p><p> Tax receipts under all heads are monitored closely and reported on in the monthly fiscal monitor, which incorporates the Exchequer statement.<\/p><p> As regards the economic rationale perspective, there were three primary reasons for the increase in the rate.  Investment in non-housing building and construction has expanded rapidly over recent years and is approaching its pre-crisis share of GNI.  The Department&rsquo;s forecasts suggest that this category of building investment will amount to some 8.1% of GNI in 2017, increasing to 10% by 2021.  These forecasts are well in excess of the long-term average of 7.1%.  The forecasts suggest that if left unchecked and combined with the need to significantly increase the level of residential construction there is a risk of overheating in the sector.<\/p><p> The need for increased housing supply is acute.  To ensure that the building and construction sector is able to meet this demand while avoiding overheating in the sector as a whole, policy measures that would incentivise a re-balancing of activity away from non-residential commercial construction activity in favour of residential activity are needed.  I would like to note that our position on this matter has been supported by a number of economic commentators.<\/p><p> The flat rate of 2% was introduced at a time when activity levels were exceptionally low.  It was intended to incentivise activity and was justified by the exceptionally difficult market situation and lack of commercial output that applied at the time of its introduction.  Activity in the sector has now fully recovered, negating the need for the continuation of such a measure.<\/p><p> I hope the foregoing will be of assistance to the committee.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hogan.

I very much welcome this discussion, which is a good example of the work this committee can do.<\/p> <p>  I asked the Taoiseach earlier today about the Government's approach on this issue.  Perhaps the officials could inform me further in that regard.  The Taoiseach informed me that the Minister for Finance was to today launch a proposal or reflect on a paper that went to Cabinet today.  In the absence of the Minister, perhaps the officials could give members some indication of what that involves.  I very much see this as an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas on which I want to focus is the possibility of a switch from the current model of local property tax towards a site value form of property tax, which I believe would bring a variety of benefits to the country.  Is that being considered as part of the review that is taking place?  I will briefly outline why it makes sense.  Central to the national planning framework is the conviction that we have to start bringing development back to the centre of our communities, make efficient use of our land and stop the ongoing sprawl of cities in our country which has huge cost to the State in terms of transport, health, education and other services.<\/p> <p>  One of the main benefits of a site value tax is it gives a great kick towards more sustainable, concentrated development.  Second, in the absence of any other measures to get back the value that the State often applies in terms of the building of infrastructure and so on, it provides a mechanism whereby that value would not necessarily accrue to the private landowner but, rather, would be a public value, which could come from rezoning, investment in the public transport system or the building of a school, that would have a real effect in terms of increasing property and land values.  A site value tax would be a very effective way of capturing some of that value.  It is a method used in Denmark, Australia, parts of America and other locations.  We are not looking for something untested or out of the ordinary.  In my experience, it has always been opposed by the Department of Finance because of the belief that we do not know who owns what land.<\/p> <p>  In 2009, the tax commission set out some of those difficulties, as well as difficulties in terms of how to assess the site value.  However, my understanding is that in the interim we have built up a better register of land ownership and there are new mechanisms involving computerised data and indexes of property transactions.  The work done by Ronan Lyons in Trinity College Dublin shows that there are ways in which such valuation schemes could be introduced at low cost.  There is a gain to the State in terms of the incentive towards a better form of housing development and also a better form of local government revenue.  I would like site value tax to apply to commercial land as well as residential land, thus replacing the rates system.  It would bring huge benefits.  It is not an issue of Dublin versus the rest of the country.  The level of tax would not necessarily vary, although research would be needed in terms of what people in Dublin would pay compared to those elsewhere in the country.  However it would begin stopping the unsustainable use of land in our country by putting absolutely valid and correct constraints on landowners.  I am very interested to know whether the witnesses or other departmental officials are considering that as part of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#D00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan for his comments.  As regards his first point on what he discussed earlier today with the Taoiseach, the Minister has this afternoon issued a press release announcing a review of the local property tax, LPT.  Today he briefed his Government colleagues on the approach the Department will be advancing during 2018.  The review will include a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of LPT.  It will start in February and will, in particular, consider the impact on LPT liabilities of properly priced developments.  It will include an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill report and will be conducted by a cross-departmental group chaired by this Department and comprising officials from Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is expected that it will be completed by the end of August and the group will provide several policy options for consideration by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the review will be to inform the Minister of any actions he may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue.  As I said in my opening address, the review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability over the short and longer terms on LPT payments of liable persons.  It will kick off in February and move on from there.<\/p> <p>  As regards the issue of site value tax, Deputy Ryan can appreciate that it was considered at some length in the original Thornhill report of 2012, which considered the issue of the market value tax that was ultimately opted for versus site value tax and the options and opportunities in that regard.  It was concluded that site value tax did not stand up to the rigorous scrutiny across several parameters or indicators by which a property tax would be introduced in the same manner that market value tax did.  The Deputy is correct that along with the Thornhill report there were previous explorations of the potential for a property tax by both commissions of taxation that looked at the approach and rejected the idea of a site value tax.

The tax commission believed that there was real economic rationale behind a site value tax but that administrative difficulties would arise.  In 2012, it feared that the real concentration was on the immediate task of getting a very quick revenue boost for the State, which was in significant financial difficulty.  Is there not a case, on the basis of what the national planning framework says we want to do, to say that we should use tax as a signal in the context of ensuring better development and use of land?  A site value tax, in my mind, would do that.  I cannot think of a better way to do that, for both commercial and residential land.  In one fell swoop, it would provide massive a stimulus towards sustainable development, which is essential for a properly working economy.<\/p> <p>  Listening to the radio this morning, I heard that construction is not happening in the centre of Dublin.  Some companies are leaving the city because we do not have the correct signals in terms of use of our land so that accommodation can be provided in the places that people want it.  A site value tax provides that.  I recognise that there are administrative difficulties.  Ten years ago, people said that we should do it but that it would take time and would not provide immediate revenue.  We now have a certain amount of time and we are in a different fiscal position.  I am of the view that it should be reconsidered in that light and in the context of the housing crisis, which, to my mind, has been caused by the inappropriate tax signals we have.  Yesterday, I met a lady in the caf&eacute; upstairs in this building.  It took her three hours to get from Edenderry to Dublin yesterday.  I am sure it took her three hours to get home in the evening.  We have chaotic transport and land use systems.  This is a chance to start getting it right.  Why should that be ruled out?  The only reason pointed to any of these reports is administrative difficulties, which is not a good enough reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#E00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that in the context of Thornhill's original assessment of the site value tax there were certainly some merits from an efficiency perspective.

I am against the property tax.  I never saw the rationale for it.  I am of the view that it is a regressive tax.  I do not expect the witness to agree with me on that.<\/p> <p>  For the record, facts are important.  At the time the property tax was first introduced, there were a number of justifications for it.  I have not checked the records, but I am fairly sure it was the case that those introducing it - presumably advised by the Department of Finance - suggested that a property tax would help quell the property market and prevent some of the excesses we saw in the period leading up to the crash in 2008.  Can the witness remind us if the Department of Finance actually advised the Government at the time that it would have this impact?  I certainly remember that as being one of the arguments that was used.<\/p> <p>  My primary concern is for the future.  There is absolutely no doubt that with a 71% increase in property values since 2013 that we are talking about frightening increases in property tax for huge numbers of people.  Has the Department carried out an assessment in terms of the regressive impact on those who cannot afford it?  That is one of the primary reasons we opposed it.  Has the Department carried out an analysis of the potential regressive impact of dramatic increases in property tax?  If I read the paper correctly, 46,000 households have already sought deferrals on the basis that their income is below the threshold.  People cannot afford to pay.  How many more households would find themselves unable to pay if there was a 71% increase.  In order to inform any meaningful discussion on this matter, we need to know that.  How many people are going to be impoverished by this because they will simply not be able to pay?  If that analysis has not been carried out the Department is not really serious about scrutinising the potential impact of this.<\/p> <p>  Does the witness know how much is owed by those who have sought deferrals on the basis that their income is not adequate to pay the tax?  How much debt liability is being built up by those who cannot afford to pay this regressive tax as a consequence of deferrals?  Is there any plan in the review of the tax to discuss the issue of ability to pay?  I do not find these discussions about site value and property very interesting, because for me the issue is whether people can pay the tax or not.  It is already clear that huge numbers of people cannot.  Dublin is full of these people, as are the other urban centres.  They are pensioners with miserable pensions, people on social welfare or those with very low incomes who happen to live in properties that have high values.  The values of those properties are going through the roof, and the tax that will be levied against them, which is bad now and may be worse in the future, bears no relationship whatsoever with their ability to pay.  Has any analysis of this been done?  Specifically, can the witness give us figures about how much is owed by that group of people who could not afford to pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#E00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, I believe that the rationale and reasons for introducing the property tax were manyfold.

My questions are in no particular order.  I represent a Dublin constituency and as the witnesses are aware, there is a feeling in urban areas that they are disproportionately affected by property tax and how it is levied.  From the figures provided in the table by the Revenue Commissioners today, I note the yield from Dublin city in 2016 was close to &euro;17 million, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown it was close to &euro;45 million and in Fingal, it was just over &euro;30 million.  In my own area of South Dublin County Council, it was &euro;26.5 million.  As Dublin local authorities accounted for 40% of the overall local property tax take, it would be catastrophic if properties were revalued given that, according the figures cited today, values in Dublin have increased by more than 80% since 2012 and 2013, while nationally figures have gone up by 71%.  I am taken by the fact that Revenue needs certain information quite quickly in terms of planning.  During the meeting of 12 December, Revenue officials stated that no analysis has been carried out on the impact of property price increases since 2013 on local property tax liabilities and yield if a re-evaluation were to be carried out.  No work has been done there.  Given that policy decisions will need to be taken in 2018, does the Department intend to carry out such an analysis?<\/p><p>The Chairman and anyone who is a local authority member will appreciate my next question.  We have talked about yield, values, and how the local property tax, LPT, is a consistent revenue yield for local authorities.  That is true in part but any increase in the income they got and are getting from the LPT was offset by a reduction in grants coming from the Department of the environment.  There was no significant net yield and this comes to the heart of the matter.  One argument put forward by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, around the time of the introduction of the local property tax was that it would lead to a significant increase in services provided by local authorities.  From my own experience of 17 years as a county councillor, I cannot testify to any<i><\/i>significant increase in revenue leading to additional local government services being provided.  The local property tax allowed for a reduction by each local authority of up to 15%.  No figures have been provided, however, and we could do with the figures on what local authorities have done in that regard over the past four or five years.  For instance, how many have reduced it year on year?<\/p><p>While South Dublin County Council reduced it every year by 15%, to my knowledge only a small number of local authorities reduced it by less than 15%.  I do not know if any local authority increased it.  I, therefore, would love to see an analysis of the exercise of the ability to increase or decrease it by 15% because very few councillors throughout the country will vote for an increase in a local tax, regardless of how it is packaged.  When I was a local councillor, each year the chief executive presented to local councillors what the council could get in if the local property tax was increased by 15%.  If the officials do not have to hand an analysis of this ability to increase or decrease the tax by 15%, perhaps they could provide it over the next few weeks.  How effective has it been or have councils and public representatives essentially felt paralysed in the face of it?  The Minister announced a review today but there seem to be mixed signals coming from the Government about this, or there were until today.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government spoke about a radical overhaul and seemed to imply that any new local property tax system would not be based on property value but on a range of other issues.<\/p><p>Another Deputy mentioned the next issue which is very close to my heart.  Both the Chairman and I represent the same area and he knows the types of estates about which I am speaking.  Older people who are reliant on the State pension are living beside someone in a terraced or a semi-detached house that is worth exactly the same, but the State pensioner is utterly reliant on the State pension while the person next door could have a significant salary, yet they are both paying the exact same property tax.  The ability of an individual to pay was never recognised and this needs to be fed into the system.  This is testified to by the amount of people struggling with it.<\/p><p>The figures for collection are testimony to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are the best sheriff in the west.  However, some counties are falling a little behind.  The Dublin counties are 98% or 99% compliant.  Those figures are very high.  The same applies to some other counties.  When we consider other urban areas such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford cities, well over 50% of the local property tax is being contributed by the urban areas.  The officials might explain why some counties are 95% compliant rather than 98% or 99%.  Are there data on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#F00600","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The Deputy might forgive me if I respond to his observations in no particular order.

I presume this is to ensure compliance rates do not decrease with increases in the amounts being charged or a variation of bands.  It comes back to a political decision for the Minister over how much revenue he wants to raise.  Does Mr. Hogan agree that a decision on how much we want to raise would provide the starting point for an interdepartmental working group, and that we would then look at how we could achieve it?  The briefing document of the Parliamentary Budget Office considers a number of options, one of which was revaluing and adjusting rates locally to maintain the current LPT yield.

However, we are fairly clear that we had quite a bit of interaction with Revenue throughout the summer, on stamp duty and on other measures that could have been taken as part of budget 2018.  That is part of the natural discourse that we have with Revenue as we build our information resource to help the Minister make budgetary decisions.  <\/p> <p>  The pre-budget ready reckoner produced by Revenue was available from mid-July onwards.  That gave an indicative number of &euro;94 million raised per 1% increase.  Often when we look at policy options to put to the Minister the background to a number such as that will be part of our dialogue with Revenue.  More generally, we discuss whether there is some scope for increasing or reducing a figure because of the potential impact of that on yield and the available fiscal space. <\/p> <p>  Throughout our discussions of the Finance Bill, there was quite a lot of interaction between the Department and our Revenue colleagues.  We discussed the change to commercial stamp duty and the associated legislative provisions that were needed to give effect in the budget to that decision by the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The representative from the Revenue stated that to the best of his recollection, there was no consultation with the Department on this measure.

I was interested in Mr. Hogan's opening statement.

He makes the point in his opening statement that \"We are advised by Revenue that, adjusting for possible one-off transactions in 2016, receipts in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 were quite stable and Revenue's assessment is that it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue.\"  How long does the Department expect the &euro;9 billion of commercial property transactions to continue?

Even the commentary from the industry over the Christmas period and into the early part of the new year has been quite upbeat in terms of the plans for further development in the sector over the next number of years.  Having regard to all of those factors, our expectation is that Revenue's approach to this has been based on solid analysis and will help us fulfil our target for stamp duty for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#K02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will revert to the question.  How long does the Department expect it to continue?  Mr. Hogan's statement says \"it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue\".  How long is it expected to continue?  Is it that we will get over 2018, we will have &euro;9 billion of property transactions, we will meet the target and it will then drop back to what it was prior to the three years which Revenue is using to calculate it?  In 2013 the level of commercial property transactions was half what is was in 2014.  Then 2014, 2015 and 2016 remained stable, when one-offs were stripped out.  I am not sure of the final figures for 2017.  How long does the Department expect that trend to continue?<\/p> <p>  It has been stated to be sustainable and for it to continue.  In the Department's view, which I am sure accepts Revenue's view, how long do we expect this?  The reason I ask is that while it will be okay if we hit the figure this year, if there is a drop off - as there was in 2013 - then half the base is gone.  It is quite interesting because, in the last conversation about the local property tax, one of the big arguing points the former Minister for Finance had at that time was about commercial stamp duty and over-reliance on it.  In his opening statement one of his major gambits was that we needed a more stable base rather than relying on 9% commercial stamp duty.  It is quite interesting that these two subjects are sandwiched together.  How long does the Department of Finance expect us to have &euro;9 billion of commercial property transactions annually?  That is the figure that needs to continue to be achieved to be able to bring in the type of revenue that is suggested would come in annually from this increase.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#K02600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I do not think we have a precise timeframe as to how long we expect this to continue.

That will be informed by what seem to be quite robust forecasts from the commercial sector as to what its expected outputs will be over the next number of years.

If it is, I am a little worried because I believe there is overheating in the commercial sector.  This increase in stamp duty is not about tax increases, rather it is about trying to slow down what is happening in this sector.  If what is happening remains constant, then this measure is not having the desired impact.  This is not just about the buildings or offices being constructed but the sharp increase in value in commercial property, which was at the core of our banking crisis.  For that reason, this is important.  Does the Department of Finance expect that level of activity to continue beyond 2018 to 2019 and 2020 and, if so, how does that sit alongside the concerns identified in the tax strategy papers the year before last regarding the need to view this as a policy option to try to cool down what is happening, particularly in the Dublin area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#L00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The considerations of the Department are informed by the projections given to it by the Revenue Commissioners and the views of the economics team within the Department on how the commercial property market is unfolding.

I am accompanied by Ms Rebecca Minch, head of energy efficiency and affordability; Mr. Frank Maughan, head of climate mitigation and awareness; Mr. Kevin Brady, head of transport energy policy; and Mr. Eamonn Confrey, head of electricity policy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The three pillars of Irish energy policy are sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness, leading to the affordability of energy.  We are very much in the mainstream of European energy policy.  One of the challenges is that very few policy interventions actually serve all three pillars equally.  <br\/><br\/>I know that renewable energy is the focus of the joint committee today.  The key element in that regard is the enabling directive of 2009 which is only 29 articles long.  It provides for the development of a renewable energy market and a process to embed renewable energy resources in the energy mix.  It very much focuses on the European approach and five of the articles deal with trade in energy supplies across borders.  It focuses on support for the integration of renewables in the transmission and distributions systems.<br\/><br\/>All countries have a national target and under the directive Ireland has a target of 16%.  Our starting point in 2005 was 3.1%.  The increase of 12.9% was the fourth largest asked of a European member state.  In making progress Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, has modelled our likely landing point in 2020.  It suggests we should land on a figure between 13.2% and 15.4%, depending on the scenario modelled, which puts us between 80% and 96% of the 2020 target.  In the second report on the state of the energy union 2017 the European Union projects that Ireland will land on a figure of 15.5%.  It is important to bear in mind that when the directive was developed, the price of a barrel of oil ranged from $60 to $70.  It subsequently went to the about $120 a barrel and peaked at $140 for a short period.  For much of this decade it has fallen back to $40 to $50 a barrel.  In Ireland we have had a very profound economic correction which has impacted significantly on consumer decision-making, particularly when it comes to heat and transport.  <br\/><br\/>In individual sectors we have had our greatest level of success under the heading of renewable electricity.  The outturn in 2016 was 27% against a target of 40%.  We do not have final data for 2017, but the initial indications are that we will land on a figure between 31% and 33%.  We have had less success under the headings of renewable heat - we landed on a figure of 6.5% against a target of 12% - and transport - we Ianded on a figure of 4.5% against a target of 10%.  Therefore, we face a significant challenge in meeting the targets set under both headings.<\/p><p>An important point borne out in the presentation is that we have to decarbonise the electricity system.  This is important for the sector itself but it is also important as we move heat and transport to electricity.  <\/p><p> Energy efficiency was the second item referred to in the letter inviting us to appear before the committee.  The International Energy Agency has identified that the barrel of oil not used is the cheapest, cleanest and most secure form of energy.  Energy efficiency has long been a focus in Irish energy policy.  We have a target of 20% by 2020 and the indications are that we will reach approximately 16%.  Unlike the renewable energy target, this is not binding but it is really important nonetheless.  In terms of funding, the constrained Exchequer position has impacted our capacity to invest but over recent years, from 2016 to 2018, funding has risen from &euro;55 million to &euro;107 million.  The increase in resources has led to new initiatives.  This year support is being provided for heat pumps, for a deep retrofit pilot warmth and well-being programme and &euro;14 million is being provided for SMEs.  <\/p><p> The focus now is much more on the post-2020 period and our ambitions out to 2030.  The European Commission has published its Clean Energy for All Europeans package which contains targets of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases and a 27% increase in energy savings.  We had negotiations at the energy Council on 18 December and substantial agreement was reached by the energy Ministers.  The package is now in the trialogue in terms of the individual instruments.  It contains a total of 11 individual instruments - eight in the package proper and three which preceded it.<\/p><p> Our next objective is the completion of the national energy and climate plan which must be in draft form by the end of the this year and submitted to the European Commission.  It must be finalised by 31 December 2019.  I will stop there for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

We are speaking primarily from the point of view of the electricity sector as we regulate in that area.  We believe the electricity sector is making good progress towards meeting our 40% target although there are obviously some risks to delivery.  It should be underlined that significant effort has gone into the successful progress towards the 40% target.  Electricity markets and networks as well as the individual generators have worked hard to deliver this new capacity.  That work is backed by the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  Electricity customers bear the costs of supporting our renewable electricity.  They do this through the aforementioned PSO levy, through additional network charges and the cost of systems services to support increasing penetration of renewables.<\/p> <p>  It is incumbent on us all to deliver decarbonisation at least cost for electricity consumers.  To that end, we believe strongly in delivering competitive, technology neutral options to determine the least cost option in terms of the next renewable support schemes.  We have supported this approach in our contribution to the Department's renewable energy support scheme and believe it is the best approach.  We also think it is important not only to focus on renewable electricity.  Decarbonisation is about heating and transport.  It is also about reducing the carbon intensity of fuels, not only about renewables.  If we think about how we might make the next gains in heating and transport, it is possible that electrification and gasification can play a role.  However, we need to do this in a smart way in order to ensure that we are not adding costs to energy consumers and that we are doing it at least cost.  <\/p> <p>  To underline the point about the costs for electricity consumers, I have included a slide on the PSO levy calculation.  We published this last summer.  Committee members can see on the graph the increase in the cost of the overall PSO levy.  The renewable element of the PSO levy is what is driving the overall increase, in the main.  That is likely to increase further as we reach our 40% target.  It is really important that we keep in mind the costs for energy consumers.  Households are currently paying &euro;92.25 per annum through the PSO levy, which could be 9% or 10% of their overall annual bill.  Customers also pay additional network charges and for the cost of system services, although they may see some benefits in terms of micro-price reductions when we have higher renewables on the system.  When we think about the next renewable electricity targets or if we are thinking about supporting higher cost renewables, we must keep in mind the impact on the PSO levy for customers.  <\/p> <p>  While we are looking at higher costs for renewable electricity support, we are not doing a bad job overall.  As we can see from the comparison of European energy regulator support schemes, Ireland has done a reasonably good job of bringing on relatively low cost renewables up to now.  The wind energy support scheme renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, has been successful and has delivered the right outcomes for the energy system at a relatively low cost.  Germany, by contrast, has supported much more expensive renewables.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. MacEvilly.

I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. John Fitzgerald, who is director of grid development and interconnection.<\/p> <p>  Since EirGrid came into existence ten years ago we have placed a key emphasis on ensuring that the national electricity transmission grid is adaptable and flexible.  This flexibility has meant that to date we have been able to accommodate the increasing levels of renewable energy being generated.  Thanks to work by policy makers such as members of this committee, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as well as the broader renewable energy industry, Ireland has now become a world leader in the integration of renewables onto the electricity grid.  As a country, we are now able to integrate over 60% of our renewables onto the grid.  This is what my engineering colleagues call system non-synchronous penetration or SNSP.  Our stated aim is to increase this to at least 75% by the end of 2020.  This is significantly ahead of our European counterparts and we believe it will assist considerably in helping this country to achieve our 2020 and 2030 targets.  <\/p> <p>  Recently an EirGrid-led consortium was awarded Horizon 2020 funding from the European Commission to see how the successful integration of renewables in Ireland might be transferred to the wider European electricity grid.  The project is called the Sysflex project and when finished in 2022, we hope that the learning and success in Ireland will lead the way in helping to decarbonise the European electricity supply.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of delivering an integrated single electricity market, ISEM, another major milestone will be reached in May of this year.  Building on the success of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland, which was a key success story of the peace process, the next phase is for us to integrate with the European electricity markets.  From May this year, when ISEM goes live, we will benefit from increased competition which we expect to deliver cheaper electricity and increased energy security.  Most importantly, we believe that the more competitive market that ISEM will deliver will bring a better price for renewable energy onto the electricity system.<\/p><p>This is accompanied by a strong public demand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to high carbon prices and incentives for renewables, which creates a high level of renewable generation on the grid.<\/p><p> A third scenario is a slower change where we see there is little change in the way electricity is generated, economic growth is slower and the adoption of new technologies at residential, commercial and electricity generation levels has been slow.  The final scenario is where we see consumer action and in a strong economy, members of the public want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In this scenario, electricity consumers will enthusiastically limit their energy use and generate their own energy, there are a large number of community-led energy projects and a rapid adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps in the home.<\/p><p> These four scenarios are a relatively accurate synopsis of the how electricity usage may develop.  The decisions taken by policymakers and legislators in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will be pivotal in determining which of these scenarios is realised by.  As a State-owned organisation, EirGrid assures the joint committee that the national electricity grid will be able to fully cater for each of these scenarios.  While we do not advocate for any particular technology - traditional generation or renewable energies - we assure members of our ability and willingness to integrate greater levels of renewables onto the national electricity grid, whether from onshore wind, offshore wind, solar or other renewable sources.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to update the joint committee on our work on integrating renewable energies.  We can provide more detail in the later discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Skelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Given that greenhouse gases cause climate change, it is important that everyone understands how much greenhouse gases Ireland produces annually.  In 2016, we produced 61 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, of which agriculture accounted for one third and electricity, transport and heat each accounting for one fifth.  The ESB is working on strategies with a dual purpose.  On the one hand, we want to decarbonise the electricity system while, on the other, we want to power the heat and transport systems with electricity.  By doing this, we will be able to address 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s total emissions and up to 80% of its energy emissions.  As a result, electricity will move from being 20% of the problem to being 60% of the solution.<\/p> <p>  We were asked to address the issue of targets.  The emissions of European Union member states are categorised in two distinct ways.  The first group of emissions relates to individual installations such as power stations and large industrial facilities.  This group is accounted for through the EU emissions trading scheme, or ETS.  The second group are non-ETS emissions, in other words, all other emissions, typically emissions from agriculture, heating homes and transporting people and goods around the country.<\/p> <p>  For the ETS group, which includes power generation, Ireland does not have an EU target to meet because responsibility rests with the owners of the relevant installations.  These installations will progressively decarbonise as the ETS reduces the amount of emissions allowed year on year.  Power generation is part of this group and the scheme will ensure power generation across the European Union decarbonises in the period until 2050 as carbon allowances are ratcheted downwards year after year.<\/p> <p>  The second group of emissions - non-ETS emissions - is more difficult.  Ireland is legally responsible for reducing its non-ETS emissions, primarily composed of emissions from agriculture, heat and transport.  Our target for 2020 requires us to reduce these emissions by 20% from 2005 levels.  Evidence to date shows there has been a shortcoming in this area.  As such, this area requires most attention in the national climate strategy.<\/p> <p>  Ireland also has renewable energy targets.  As Mr. Manley stated, we have a renewable energy sources, RES, target of 16% by 2020.  We have chosen to address this target by having a 40% target for RES electricity, a 12% renewable heat target and a 10% renewable transport target.  Analysis to date indicates we will not meet the 16% RES target and the most recent reports suggest we may achieve a RES of 13%.  However, the ESB's analysis indicates we will meet the 40% target set for electricity.  We believe that between 3,800 MW and 4,300 MW of wind generated electricity will be needed to meet the 40% target.  We currently have 3,300 MW of wind connected on the system and we are projecting that we will have another 1,000 MW on the system by 2020.  As such, we are well on the way to achieving the electricity element of the RES target.<\/p> <p>  While our shortcomings in respect of emissions and renewable targets related to heat, transport and agriculture rather than electricity, we should not be complacent about electricity decarbonisation.  We will achieve the 40% target in or around 2020 but we have to do more to increase this figure as we move to 2020 and 2050.  The ESB's view of the future is to decarbonise the electricity system to enable the electrification of the heat and transport sectors.  This was the subject of a comprehensive report we published in November 2017 entitled, Ireland&rsquo;s Low Carbon Future - Dimensions of a Solution. <\/p> <p>  I will briefly address the solar and offshore wind sectors.  By 2020, we will produce 40% of our electricity through renewable energies, largely onshore wind and hydro power.  In our view, there is limited scope on the island for further onshore wind.  We estimate a further 1,000 MW of onshore wind is possible over and above that which is in the pipeline.  We must, therefore, look offshore, which offers great potential for wind generation.  Ireland has a small amount of offshore wind but there are many consented projects around the island.  It is in this area that we envisage further RES growth under the new renewable electricity support scheme.<\/p> <p>  Solar energy will also have a significant part to play in the future energy mix and there are a large number of applications for grid connections for solar power.  Not all of these are consented projects, however, and some will not proceed unless there are attractive supports in place.  Solar costs have reduced by as much as 80% since 2009 and we expect them to decrease further.  In this context, we must avoid locking in high prices for customers.<\/p> <p>  On the retrofit of buildings, we will not meet our climate targets unless we can decarbonise the heat sector.  It is estimated that 30% of the houses in which people will live in 2050 have yet to be built.  This means between 500,000 and 600,000 new houses will be added to the housing stock by 2050.  The first step, therefore, is to ensure these houses are built to a standard that reduces their demand for energy and ensures the energy they use is zero carbon-emitting.  All the technologies required to achieve these objectives are available and consideration should be given to altering the building regulations to ensure they are met.<\/p> <p>  While the existing housing base is more difficult to address, the same two principles should apply, namely, we should reduce their demand for energy and switch to zero carbon energy sources.  This will ensure we progressively address the existing inventory of carbon based heating over the coming decades.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, oil is the major fuel for domestic heating and has a significant carbon footprint.  Heat pumps with insulation and air tightness are the leading candidate to replace oil.  <\/p> <p>  The policy focus will increasingly need to shift towards the 2030 targets as a critical milestone on Ireland's journey to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050.  Decarbonising electricity and powering the heat and transport sectors from this offering gives Ireland the best means of addressing its current and future targets and enabling electricity to move from being 20% of the problem to being 60% of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I invite the chairman of the Irish Solar Energy Association, Mr. David Maguire, to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#F00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I am joined by colleagues, Mr. Michael McCarthy, Mr. Michael Moore and Mr. Barry Sherry.  I thank the joint committee for inviting us to make a presentation.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on some of the points made by previous speakers, Ireland has been extremely successful in terms of the cost at which it has deployed wind energy.  I understand the cost of wind here is among the lowest in Europe.  The deployment of that non-synchronous generated energy on our transmission network has been extremely successful and we are a leader in this area.  Nonetheless, according to recent figures from the Environmental Protection Agency, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.7% in the past year.  We also heard from the previous speaker that in terms of our renewable energy targets for 2020, we are likely to see a shortfall of 3% across the renewable sectors.<\/p> <p>  While I appreciate that under the European Union's renewable energy scheme, RES, there has been a focus on 2030, which is appropriate, we can also do something about the 2020 targets.  While solar power is not a silver bullet and will not solve all the issues, it can make a significant contribution. <\/p> <p>  A number of speakers referred to our successful track record in various aspects of the renewable sector in recent years.  Nonetheless, under the climate change performance index, which is effectively the assessment of 14 indicators, including greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy, we are ranked 49 out of 56 states.  This places Ireland last in Europe in terms of performance on climate change, which is extremely disappointing.  As a nation, we rely on large amounts of foreign direct investment.  The green image of the country is being tarnished by the lack of action on climate change in recent years.  <\/p> <p> On the more immediate financial implications for Ireland of failing to meet the 2020 targets, estimates of the cost range from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million per annum.  While I do not wish to get caught up on these costs, they are significant and a matter of real concern.  In that context, I speak not as a representative of the solar industry but as a taxpayer.  It is unfortunate that we have very little time left to bridge that gap.  Solar power can assist in mitigating against this financial liability.  According to Bloomberg, solar power has attracted more investment than wind.<\/p><p>In 2016, &euro;160 billion of new investment was made in solar alone, more than in coal and gas in the same period.  Clearly, it is a technology that is gaining lots of ground in terms of its deployment and investment.  Ireland is the only EU member state that does not offer a support mechanism for solar energy.  I may be critical of that, as a representative of the solar industry, but I actually think it is a great opportunity because we have a late-mover advantage both in adopting best practice in design support and in technology, design, planning and construction.  More than that, because of the cost reductions in solar in the past decade, we can benefit from deployment at a much cheaper price than other EU member states.<\/p><p> Solar continues to decrease but only at approximately 7% or 8% per annum and the industry welcomes the proposal from the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, that we have competitive auctions.  We are very concerned, however, about a technology-agnostic auction, which we have seen in other member states and which do not work.  In Ireland, they would lead mostly to the deployment of wind at a potentially higher cost.  We believe we can deploy 1.5 GW of solar by the end of 2020, thus mitigating at least half of the potential cost to the Exchequer.  The average cost would be between &euro;14 million and &euro;15 million per annum, or less than 7 cent on a monthly basis in the average consumer bill, to avoid a potential fine, or cost in terms of credits, in excess of &euro;200 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Our sixth witness is head of policy at the Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, Dr. David Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#G00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Peter Harte will start and I will take the second half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Connolly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>We have circulated slides.  I will focus on the key issue regarding wind, which is community engagement and social acceptance.  I will take members through the history of this.  There has been a detailed process of engaging with communities since 2006, following the Department's guidelines, and IWEA developed a number of codes of practice as well as updates to the guidelines over the years in 2012.  The Department launched a good document in 2016 and we fully support and endorse it.  We produced a document on being a good neighbour in 2013 and formalised the practice of the time of putting in place a community benefit fund of some &euro;1,000 per MW.  The amount is proposed to be increased under the RESS consultation, which sets a price a of &euro;2 per MW hour, bringing the figure to &euro;275,000 per turbine over the life of a project.  They are substantial figures and, not surprisingly, we find that these funds are very well received.<\/p> <p>  All this process and paperwork would not count for anything if it did not have an effect and we believe, notwithstanding a vocal minority, that there is very strong support for wind in Ireland.  One of the studies that was carried out was a survey of 2,000 adults in October 2017, which showed that 84% of people were fully or strongly in favour of wind energy, with only 3% strongly opposed.  This 3% are very vocal and we hear a lot from them but it is important to keep the numbers in perspective.  The trend is also important and support has been rising over the past five years.  Another study commissioned by the ESRI last May gives almost exactly the same result and it has some useful suggestions for moving forward with community benefit and community ownership.<\/p> <p>  Members will see specific examples of the Sliabh Bawn project, which is a Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na joint venture of 58 MW.

There has been a lot of talk of community ownership and the industry fully supports this.  We supported it in our response to the RESS consultation paper and some of our members are already offering this to communities.  We have surveyed our members and 70% already have a community scheme in place, as well as being open to ownership.  We may not have got everything right but our members are improving the level of engagement we have with communities and this has resulted in good acceptance.

Wind energy is delivering and the latest figures suggest that over 25% of electricity last year was delivered from onshore wind, putting Ireland at No. 2 in the world for wind penetration.  This is an amazing achievement and something that has come about thanks to a long-term, stable policy backed up by an industry that has been able to deliver.  The electricity sector demonstrates how Ireland can be successful in delivering renewable energy to our energy system.<\/p> <p>  We have mentioned the 16% renewable energy target by 2020.

Solar could provide some additional generation capacity, given how quickly it can be delivered subject to planning and grid connection.<\/p> <p>  As regards the expansion of solar power globally, new solar PV capacity grew by 50% last year although it remains around 2% of global supply.  It has outpaced gas, coal and wind in terms of growth in the past 12 months and is considered likely to continue on that trend.  The costs of solar have decreased by approximately 85% since 2009, predominantly catalysed by national support schemes in other jurisdictions.  It has increased demand so the scale of the supply chain has increased and the amount of research and development has increased, adding to efficiency and reducing costs for delivered capacity.  Ireland can benefit from that through appropriate support of solar PV.<\/p> <p>  There are only in the region of 10 MW of solar in Ireland, predominantly at residential and SME scale.  Ireland supports solar PV at that scale through better energy communities and accelerated capital allowances but, to date, no support has been in place at utility scale.<\/p><p>Small-scale deployment is important because it can tie in communities, businesses and individuals to a technology and the tangible benefits relating to it such that as attempts are made to develop a utility scale, they are comfortable with it.  There is no one method that appears to be successful for micro-generation support.  Net metering, tariffs and grants have been attempted in other jurisdictions.  In terms of micro-generation support, we need to determine what is right for Ireland and this cannot be done in a short timeframe. <\/p><p> On the large-scale side, there is a trend towards auctions, particularly technology-neutral auctions.  It is a matter for the Department to determine how this would be conducted.  The Department is currently in the middle of a review of the consultation phase of the RESS to address that issue.<\/p><p> The SEAI has produced a report on the supply chain opportunities for Ireland with regard to solar PV focusing only on those industries where we are currently leading, including semi-conductor production, and how we can transfer those skills into the PV industry.  On deep retrofit, the SEAI, funded by the Department, has supported the upgrade of approximately 300,000 homes over the past seven to eight years.  We have started raising the bar for our commodity schemes.  For example, in regard to the better energy  homes scheme, this week we dropped oil and gas supports but we have increased the support for external wall insulation and for controls, where a larger bang for buck for the taxpayers' euro is achieved.  Separately, as soon as possible over the coming months we will implement a support for heat pumps which, again, will help the transfer of people from fossil fuels to more sustainable heat supplies.  Alongside the increase in the lower bar, we are examining the deep retrofit of buildings.  This is a specific project looking at the different types of houses in different conditions in the country in terms of the best combination of technologies to bring our housing stock to the level it needs to be at by 2050.  We are examining the technologies available, the return on investment for those technologies, the supply chain, how the homeowner will finance it and how in the background not just the Exchequer but private sector finance can be brought this area.  We have early learnings that I am happy to do into in more detail with any of the members or the Chairman.<\/p><p> There is a similar trend regarding offshore wind.  There has been a significant decrease in the overall cost of offshore wind across a number of different auctions in Europe and worldwide.  It is a technology that has proven to deliver at scale.  The challenges in Ireland that could need to be addressed, that can help militate against inertia in these projects, would be the review of the offshore renewable energy development plan which is underway in the Department and will set this consistent policy framework.  Separately, it is critical that the maritime area and foreshore Bill is delivered soon to provide clarity around that licensing and consenting regime for external developers and Irish developers.<\/p><p> I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon and I invite Mr. Barry Sharkey to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#H00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Members will forgive me if I am bit nervous.

My submission is about regional development, the creation of long-term, highly-skilled, sustainable jobs and the stimulation of a new industry in clean technology, which is struggling to get off the ground in Ireland.  It is also about improving the competitiveness of Irish businesses and farming.  I have heard nothing this evening about energy poverty and nothing about the people in homes who are struggling to pay their electricity bills.  I read in one submission that it is predicted that energy prices in Ireland will increase by 36% over the next ten years and that it is proposed to increase the PSO levy for everybody by 6%.  I am making this submission on behalf of consumers, the people who pay their electricity bills and the PSO levy, which is being divided between all the other industries.<\/p> <p>  The White Paper contains many paragraphs about the need to engage citizens and communities in the energy transition policy and the benefits of moving to green energy.  However, I have not heard much about this evening.  Approximately 10% of the PV energy that will be generated in Ireland in the future will come from roof-top solar on farm buildings, factories, shops and homes.  This 10% is very important.  I am proposing that roof-top solar be incentivised.  Last night's \"Prime Time\" programme addressed the serious consequences of a harsh Brexit for the farming industry and rural communities.  In terms of roof-top solar, farmers have acres of ready-to-go sites with grid connections, as have our industries, shops, homes and sports clubs.  Every sports club in the country has a building on site.  These are all ready-to-go sites with grid connections, planning permission and so on.  If my proposal is not taken on board we will have renewable industry that will meet our targets and we will have solar PV which will meet our targets but there will be no clean tech industry, no regional development, no regional job creation and no relief for households.  In every developed country in the world, roof-top solar was rolled out first.  California is the prime example of how to do this right.  It did not go straight to an auction system.  The only country in Europe, of which I aware, that went straight to an auction system for solar PV is Greece and that was a disaster.  Today, I am proposing that roof-top solar be incentivised sooner rather than later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Sharkey"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for adhering to their time allocations.

The departmental officials did not elaborate sufficiently on the potential cost of missing the targets.  I have heard a number of people mention 2020 but then say that we are really moving towards 2030.  It seems that if we do not achieve the 2020 target, we face significant fines that we will carry into the future.  It is bit like sitting the junior certificate examination and taking the view that it does not really matter because the leaving certificate examination is the important one.  If a student cannot get his or her act together in terms of a study plan for the junior certificate examination, then he or she probably will not have it in place for the leaving certificate examination.<\/p><p>As a politician who looks to the electoral cycle, I am conscious that when we stand back from that cycle, we often bemoan our failure to get things right that have been going on for ten, 15 or 20 years.  I am concerned that the electoral cycle is a factor when this is being looked at from a departmental and a political perspective.  The concern is that because 2030 is a long way off, successive Ministers have decided that this is not something they need to sort out.  I suspect someone may have taken that view a little bit further back.  Now that we are heading into this particular cycle, people have to address it.<\/p><p> I ask the witnesses to comment on the potential cost.  How might that money be better deployed in the medium term?  Mr. Gannon has said that if we address the solar aspect of this matter, in addition to some of the onshore wind aspect, we could improve our output and increase our return within a short period.  This would be of some benefit and would lead to some money being saved.  Any short-term investment that prevents us having to pay fines is a better form of investment.<\/p><p> I am conscious that we are looking principally at electricity generation, where the laggards or blackguards - I am not talking about anyone individually - are the transport and heat sectors.  As a committee, maybe we should be exercising most of our functions in addressing the areas of greatest concern.  Everybody here has a good news story to tell.  Perhaps we are looking for a little bit more.  We are trying to squeeze the last couple of per cent out of a sector that has performed exceptionally well.  Maybe the committee should reflect on how we might address that in the future.<\/p><p> I was interested in Mr. Sharkey's point because I know a little bit about it.  I have met the chairman of the Micro Renewable Energy Federation.  I have read what Mr. Sharkey and his colleagues have produced to date.  It is more important to focus on getting citizens to buy into this than it is to focus on what is deliverable against our targets.  The electric car is a case in point.  The witnesses are part of a big industry that is often largely at a remove from consumers.  When a consumer plugs in the kettle and it works, he or she generally does not know too much about how that happens.  The kettle boils.  The television comes on.  It is there.  That is big industry.  That is really important.  That is where we need to focus.  If we want citizens to change their behaviour right across the environmental arena, we need to get that right.<\/p><p> Mr. Sharkey has brought to the table an opportunity for citizens to see short-term benefits from their decision to buy into the protection of the environment.  It is not necessarily going to change how we will view electricity in 2050, but it will get citizens to change their behaviour in an array of ways.  I know people who have adapted, moved to electric vehicles and changed the way they live their lives in many other respects.  They are focusing on the environment and on how they treat it.  For that reason, the initiatives discussed by the people in the Micro Renewable Energy Federation and by Mr. Sharkey have the capacity to bring people with them.  They also have the capacity to address some of the issues that have been discussed by the witnesses, including those from the onshore wind sector.  It has been suggested that 3% or 4% of people are against this.  As people buy into the protection of our environment in a meaningful way, they must see themselves having a role in it.  For many people, electricity and public transport are behind the scenes, whereas the decisions they make in their own lives have real potential.  I think we need to try to support such initiatives, even if they might not result in a massive dial change in respect of our targets in the short term.<\/p><p> I have a real concern about the RESS and the notion of taking a technology-agnostic approach to the auctions because I believe it equates to hoping some other country will resolve our problem for us.  We need to get some level of activity in the whole solar area at an early stage.  Perhaps it is not early any more.  We need to develop that technology ourselves.  We are behind the curve in this regard.  We need to catch up.  That is why I think the technology-agnostic approach to the auctions is not in our best interests in the long term.  It does not provide for diversity.  I do not mean to be negative with regard to onshore wind in any way.  We need to be looking at offshore wind in this context as well.  The witnesses might not be aware that before today's meeting of the joint committee, we decided to invite representatives of other groups to come before us, including those involved in the offshore wind sector, which is an area of untapped potential.  People have told me we are ten years away from putting this in place, but that should not be the case given the resource we have.  I know there is a cost associated with it from the point of view of the Department.  We need to address it.<\/p><p> There are probably some other points I intended to make.  I have written so many notes for myself that I am starting to get a bit confused.  I am sure the Chairman is delighted that I am concluding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#H00700","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I ask the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to respond.

The target set for the public sector is to improve its energy efficiency by 33% by 2020.  That is even higher than the target set for the rest of the economy and society.  Significant opportunities exist in this regard.  It has been made clear in the SEAI's annual reports on public sector energy efficiency performance that since 2009, the public sector has improved its energy efficiency by 20%.  It has reached the level that we are trying to get the rest of the economy to reach.<\/p> <p>  While good progress has been made, real challenges remain.  One of these involves the deeper retrofit of the building stock.  Much of the progress that has been made so far has come from behaviour change, which is extremely important, through the OPW's Optimising Power at Work scheme.  We need to maintain our efforts in that regard.  We have achieved a lot, but we are now at a juncture where we need to move on.  The next step change in effort must involve achieving savings by upgrading the fabric of public sector buildings.  To that end, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment made &euro;6 million available in 2017 for a partnership scheme between the SEAI and the OPW to carry out retrofits of central government buildings.  This scheme had a successful first year.  The critical thing is to get replicable packages in areas like procurement, specification and design that can be rolled out in a cost-effective way across the building stock.  A further &euro;2 million has been provided as part of a partnership between the SEAI and the Department of Education and Skills for a deep retrofit of ten schools around the country.  Some of those schools have seen energy savings of as much as 40% as a result.  All of that tells us there is a big opportunity in this area.<\/p> <p>  Of course, funding all of this has been a very big challenge in more recent years.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is leading a new governance network of senior managers across all Departments to identify a project pipeline out to 2020 but also beyond.  We think our approach out to 2020, which focuses on heating and lighting, is a cost-effective one.  We will take opportunities before 2020 as they arise.  We are working closely with the SEAI and the OPW to identify where opportunities arise in the life cycle of public sector buildings and where it is cost-effective to carry out deep renovations.<\/p> <p>  New builds are also important.  The public sector is showing the way in that regard.  That is why the public sector is required to adhere to the nearly zero energy building regulations two years ahead of the wider economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Minch"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Would one of the witnesses like to answer the question about the mitigation measures under the national mitigation plan and answer Deputy Dooley's question about targets and costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#J00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I will answer the question about the targets and Mr. Maughan will answer the question about the mitigation plan.  Understandably, there is a big focus on the targets and the costs.  There is always a focus on money.  Essentially, the costs will be determined by how much we miss the targets by and how much it will cost to purchase statistical transfers.  As I said at the outset, the renewable energy directive is not really a punitive instrument.  It is designed to create a framework through which countries can develop renewable energies.  In fact, it has five articles dealing with international trade and renewable energy through statistical transfers.<\/p><p>Statistical transfers through cross-border projects are important.  Statistical transfers will be a system whereby those countries with a surplus will sell to those countries with a shortfall.  We have been trying to get some sense of what that could mean.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, did an analysis.  It looked at a situation where we had to pay the cost of creating renewables in other countries.  The figures were in a range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point.  If a country misses a target by 3%, that would give a range of between &euro;195 million to in excess of &euro;400 million.  There has been one trade so far.  Luxembourg has done a trade with Latvia to make up its shortfall.  If that sets a benchmark, then the total cost of 3% would be &euro;60 million, which is &euro;20 million per percentage point.  Overall, the European Commission estimates that Europe will exceed the 20% target for 2020 and achieve 21%.  In a normal market where supply exceeds demand, that impacts price.  It is important that statistical transfers are not seen as a failure within the directive.  They are seen as an instrument that a country can opt to use.  It supports the energy union throughout Europe.  It is not necessarily a preferred point of departure.  A number of people have made a point about the new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, and how we could play a role in accelerating its delivery and bringing forward solar, additional onshore or offshore wind energy, of which we are very cognisant.  We aim to have the new RESS operational in 2019.  There are a range of potential costs for statistical transfers but, right now, it is really difficult to put a precise number on where that will end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>To answer the Chair's question on mitigation plan measures, it is important to recall that when the mitigation plan was published in July of last year, it set out a range of measures which were already in place across Government for four separate sectors - electricity, the built environment, transport and agriculture - to address greenhouse gas emissions.  It also identified a number of other measures on which work was continuing.  In total, there were just over 70 measures, supported by more than 100 separate actions which were identified as necessary work to take forward for the consideration of individual measures.  The short answer is that measures were in place.  Some measures have subsequent announcements relating to them.  For example, there have been announcements about the development of the support scheme for renewable heat, the renewable electricity support scheme and smart metering.  The mitigation plan reflected a certain point in time and the position across Government then.  It was characterised as a living document by the Minister.  That very much continues to be the case.  I bring back to the committee's attention the annual transition statement which was laid before the Houses in December of last year, which presented an update on the implementation of the measures in the mitigation plan across the system.  It reflects, as I mentioned, updates which had been announced by the relevant Ministers and also updates where announcements from the budget acted to enhance and expand existing measures.  That will be an ongoing annual, iterative process for the expansion of measures already in place or the announcement of new measures.<\/p> <p>  I will address Deputy Dooley's question on costs of meeting targets.  As Mr. Manley has mentioned about the issue of compliance costs with renewables directives, there is a separate set of compliance issues around our targets for the non-emissions trading system, ETS, sector.  Similar to renewables, the question is where we will land in 2020.  Unlike the renewables directive, the legislation governing the non-ETS sector has individual targets for each year of the period from 2013 to 2020.  Between 2013 and 2016, our emissions have been under our targets so we have been able to bank a certain amount of excess allowances to carry forward into future years.  We know based on EPA projections and published inventory data that, notwithstanding what we have been able to bank, there will continue to be a shortfall.  It estimates, based on current policy implementation, a shortfall of between 11 million and 13 million tonnes, cumulatively, over those eight years.  Those projections will continue to be updated annually by the EPA.  The next projections are due to be published in March or April of this year.  That will allow us to refine further our assessment of our shortfall between now and 2020.  The other part of the equation is the price.  Unlike the renewable space, it is probably fair to say that there is not a market on which we can identify the price on which we may end up purchasing allowances.  The point is that the EU 28 are expected to succeed in reducing their emissions well below their targets.  Cumulatively, the European Environment Agency estimates that we could see a potential surplus of &euro;1 billion in allowances in the system overall.  With that level of surplus, we would expect the prices to be quite low.  It is only when we start to speak to potential seller countries that we get a sense of how much they are willing to sell their allowances for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Maughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>The Chairman mentioned the report.  She asked about 60% of all vehicles sold in 2030 being electric vehicles, EVs, and also about the infrastructure.  I will point out two points in the report which might be of interest to members.  A battery electric vehicle on the electricity system in Ireland right now would be twice as carbon efficient as an internal combustion engine.  Right now, it is carbon effective to have a battery EV rather than an internal combustion engine.  As the electricity system decarbonises further to 2020 and beyond that to 2030 and 2050, that ratio increases massively.  There is no comparison between the amount of carbon produced by a battery EV compared with an internal combustion engine.  The question was not about that but about the projections for 60% of all cars sold in 2030.  We did much research to come up with the report.  It was peer-reviewed research from different organisations across the globe.  There is a general view that, before 2025, we will reach cost parity between the battery EV and the internal combustion car.  At that rate, one would expect to see a much bigger uptake of the battery EV.  We also expect that, by then, the range of the battery EV will be significantly beyond where it is now.  Taking those two points together, I would argue that, to date, we have overestimated the penetration of EVs at different time periods.  I think there is a real prospect that we will now underestimate it.  I think the electric vehicle will take off in a really massive way and our research would show that.<\/p> <p>  On the question about infrastructure, the infrastructure has to be there.  It is in three flavours.  The first flavour is fast chargers.  Think of motorway service stations.  The Department is working with its work group about how that might come into play.  I am confident that will come into play.  The second is the matter of on-street chargers which we currently see.  There is work to do to work out just where that fits.  The third matter is domestic charging.  To enable the electricity system to allow domestic charging at the sort of volume we predict for 2030, significant investment will be required in the distribution system in particular since there will suddenly be a whole street of cars to charge at the same time.  That is a very different technical question for the distribution system than the current system where electricity demand is far more dispersed across individual users.  I think, for the price controls that we will get into over future years, that will have to feature with regard to how one actually funds the level of investment required in networks to enable EVs.  Five years ago had we asked about the electrification of transport, it was an open question as to whether it would happen.  I think that question is done and dusted.  It has been answered.  Electrification of the small vehicle is, by the large majority view of analysts, the way it will go.  Hydrogen will play a part in large vehicles but electrification of small vehicles will happen.  All the things that need to be put in place to enable that will have to be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I will address the question about offshore electricity generation.  Ireland has a huge wind resource.  To give a sense of that, an SEAI report once estimated Ireland's wind resource at approximately 45,000 MW.  We currently have approximately 3,000 MW.  Our opinion in the Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, would be that it is about trying cost-effectively to get the best projects for the consumer out of that huge resource onto our system.  With that in mind, we would commend the Department's proposal in the recent RESS for there to be technology neutral auctions.  In that case, projects could compete with one another and the most cost-effective would then be brought forward to be developed.<\/p><p>In that sense, the consumer is getting the best value projects onto the system.  The IWEA's view is that the key to making that happen is for policy to remove any unnecessary barriers for either onshore or offshore companies when they access technology neutral auctions.  Over time, as the price of offshore wind comes down and as the best sites for onshore wind begin to be used up, we are likely to see a transition where more offshore wind starts to come onto the system throughout the next decade.  There should at least be more diversity in our portfolio.  It is not about picking one over the other.  It is about providing a platform where they can compete against each other for the most cost-effective projects to come forward.  We call on policymakers to make sure that both technologies do not face unnecessary barriers in accessing the market, grid, planning and so on.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley mentioned that the electricity sector is predominantly represented at this meeting.  We echo that the shortfall is primarily in heat and transport but I reiterate they can take two lessons from the electricity sector.  One is that the key to the success in the sector was a long-term stable policy.  Energy is not something that can be fixed in a short two or three-term horizon.  One has to have a long-term perspective because of the scale of the changes that are necessary.  The sector has demonstrated how that can be achieved.  Second, I echo the views on how electricity can be a key part of the solution to decarbonising heat and transport.  We often use an electric vehicle or a heat pump, for example.  They are three to four times more efficient than the fossil fuel alternative that is used.  Electricity is a fundamental part of the solution to the shortfall in heat and transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>According to Mr. Sharkey's research, for every &euro;1 of State incentive support, &euro;3 is generated in economic activity.

The authority estimated that the photovoltaic, PV, market would be worth &euro;341 million and that if we were able to build our expertise in that regard, we could capture some of the European market, which is valued at &euro;4.5 billion.  I have an article about a company in France that has won a contract in the state of Victoria in Australia for a wind turbine project.  It is buying the wind turbines from Germany and the battery storage from the US.  This is what the clean technology industry means.  This is not impossible for Irish companies if we build up our expertise, but if we just build solar farms, close the gate without building up industry and expertise, that will not happen.  I have been involved in this business for the past 30 years.  I was winning contracts in Norway, Denmark, Spain and Portugal, buying in all the equipment and sending it and my technicians to those countries.  This is what I mean by a clean technology industry and building up regional jobs in our industry.  We must start small.  People say the house of the future will be all electric.  It will have electric cars, heat pumps, and cookers.  I analysed what a future electricity bill will be and it will come in at approximately &euro;3,500, which is a massive bill for every household.  Every one of us gets an electricity bill.  Some of us get two or three if we have a business, office or factory.  We should examine how this bill can be reduced for people.  I came up with an analysis that can reduce that amount by 40%.  It can be easily done.  I have not designed the system.  It is being done in Germany.  We should consider what is being done in Germany and Denmark.  Denmark has the same population as Ireland and 18,000 people are employed in the clean technology industry while 100,000 are employed in Germany and more than 1 million in California.  Our industry employs approximately 100 people.<\/p> <p> Can I have one minute to show how an electricity bill can be reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Sharkey"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Yes, briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#L00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>First, customers should install a solar PV and size it to the size of their house or business.

Battery storage is currently used in domestic houses, for example, in Germany where 100,000 houses have it.  Then off-peak electricity should be used to fill the batteries in order that the cost of an electricity unit can be halved and the batteries can be used during the day.  Each homeowner should be given a subsidy which will cut the bill by another 5% and then they should become part of the smart grid, which the ESB is experimenting with in Dingle.

I am full of hope that we, as a country, will be brilliant at this.  According to the EirGrid calculator, wind generates 2,951 MW, which is amazing, although it is a windy day.  I think of the former head of EirGrid who swore to me only ten years ago that the maximum wind generation would be only 800 MW in the Irish system and that it was physically impossible and dangerous to go beyond that.  Now it is running at 3 GW.  EirGrid has demonstrated expertise since it gave up that old-fashioned view of the world and it has become a world leader in integration renewables.<\/p> <p>  I read with interest the scenarios and alternatives, which were referred to earlier.  I would go with a combination of the low carbon living and consumer action scenarios.  If I have read this correctly, EirGrid is saying that by 2030, we could have 75% renewables in our system.  This is according to the experts.  I scratch my head and I wonder.  I have the height of time for Mr. Manley but why did the Department come out in the renewables support consultation before Christmas and say that as part of the mainstream scenario, the State will maintain the current level of renewables, with a target of 40% by 2030 being the height of its ambitions?  That beggars belief in a world where China, California and Germany are pursuing an industrial revolution.  I follow closely what the Department is doing in Brussels.  I attended the climate summit in Bonn and met the head of the Climate Action Network who said it was terribly sad that in every file, Ireland was taking a negative stance when it came to emissions.  That is why we are No. 49 in its world league table.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Department's submission on 17 November to the European Commission on the renewable energy directive and its submission to the Commission on 5 December on the electricity market design and, in every single section, Ireland has taken a negative position regarding this revolution that is inevitable and under way.  Why does the Department not set a 75% renewables target by 2030 and why does it not back that up in Europe by supporting interconnection, community ownership and sectoral targets rather than opposing every one of those initiatives in those public documents?<\/p> <p>  Similarly, I have the highest regard for the ESB.  It is the finest example of a semi-State enterprise with a proud tradition and brilliant people, management and engineers.  I despair when I hear the ESB representatives saying the issue of the ETS has nothing to do with us as policymakers, and they are in with Poland and we have to let them be because it is not their issue.  If the ESB were a private company, I would agree with Mr. O'Shea, but in this case the public are the shareholders and, as Oireachtas Members representing the public, we have the right to say that the approach where the company keeps on burning coal in Moneypoint and other companies continue to burn peat in peat-fired power stations is simply not acceptable.<\/p><p>It may be legally correct but politically it is just plain wrong.  From my calculations based on the SEAI figures for 2016, there are 7 million tonnes of carbon per annum from those four power stations.  I agree about electricity, which is represented here, being 60% of the solution but it cannot be 10% or more of the problem.  If we switched them off tomorrow, it would not have a single effect on the security of electricity supply.  It would improve our competitive position because the peat is so expensive.  It is doable and it helps us in a whole range of other energy sectors or industry sectors where the likes of Apple and others are saying they want 100% renewable power supply.  We can do that but not if we keep burning coal and peat.  It has to stop now.  From the public policy side, as the ESB is representing its shareholders, who are the Irish people, it should stop and stop telling us it is an ETS market, it is complex and if we give up, Poland will keep going.  We will deal with Poland separately in foreign affairs but in terms of Irish domestic policy, the ESB has to stop now.<\/p><p> I will make two other points.  Mr. Gannon said microgeneration is complex.  It is complex because of net metering and how prices are decided.  We have to look at the demand side and management, so it is very complicated.  I agree 100% with Mr. Sharkey that we should be aiming for 2.5 GW of rooftop solar energy in 2030.  Mr. Sharkey has said two years, which would be a miracle, but even if it takes ten years to achieve 2.5 GW, we should aim for it.  My understanding of the EirGrid scenarios is that if we added 3 GW of offshore wind and 1 GW of onshore wind, we would be at 75%.  That is all doable technologically.  When I hear Mr. Gannon saying it is complicated and cannot be done in a short period of time, my response is we have been thinking about this for ten years.  Which of those mechanisms would Mr. Gannon support if he was asked tomorrow by a Minister who wanted to announce rooftop solar energy next Friday?  This is a revolution.<\/p><p> We have a difficulty here.  It is very good to have all the people we have here but they are all representatives from the generation side and they do not even represent all the generation side.  We do not have offshore wind, which is a huge opportunity for us.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that we should not just be thinking 3 GW.  When that offshore floating technology comes, there is nothing to stop us from putting 10 GW off the west coast and, with interconnection, shipping it into the rest of Europe.  We could put 5 GW in the Irish Sea and another 5 GW down off Cork.  That is what we should be thinking about.  That is what the Chinese are thinking.  That is where the real world is at.  I was at a conference in Brussels a few months ago with big developers.  People told me they are thinking in 5 GW chunks.  How come we are not thinking at that scale of ambition as a country?  That is what the ESB should be thinking of in line with its proud tradition of thinking big and long term.  When we have to do our work, it is difficult because we have not even looked at transport, heat or the demand side, which is efficiency and heat retrofitting of domestic buildings.  It is really good we are hearing from representatives from the generation side today.  The question I would ask the Department is why not aim for 75% by 2030.  EirGrid is a world expert in how to integrate renewables.  Why not go for that?  Why not do a solar support scheme straight away for rooftops because that is part of the revolution we need?  The industrial revolution is in the balancing of all this power supply.  It is huge for the ESB because it will not be the death of the grid.  If there are heat pumps and EVs, all the demand will be on that domestic grid.  The amount of work to be done in getting that right is massive and that is what we should be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#L00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>If the witnesses could bank those questions, I will go to Senator Lombard before I go to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I missed some of the presentations because I was at other meetings.  I have two questions for the Department and one for Mr. Maguire.  I have an issue with where we are with our emissions and where we will be going with our emissions.  We are now talking about 2020 but I am asking about after 2020.  We have two coal plants on the island that are considerable.  There is Moneypoint and there is one in Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland.  We have an all-Ireland grid.  That is where we are at the moment.  With Brexit coming down the line, we have issues regarding licensing.  Different licensing could be brought in.  What negotiations and what thoughts has the Department put into those issues?  Where is the Department regarding an all-Ireland electricity platform if we have a Brexit?  How will we deal with the regulations attached to it?  If we have one coal plant in the South doing one thing and sticking to the regulations and one coal plant in another jurisdiction in the same energy network doing something else, how can we work towards targets after 2020?  I am asking what body of work is behind that thought.  What information can the witnesses give to assure me we have a plan in place and that we are thinking about it and planning for an unfortunate situation if it arises?  I do not know what will happen with Brexit but I want to know the plan.<\/p> <p>  The other issue for the Department is solar farms, which have been an issue in recent months if not years.  There have been issues regarding planning permissions that we have seen throughout the country.  Tonight we have no planning guidelines for those solar farms.  Local authorities and local councils throughout the country have been requesting the Department to bring forward those guidelines.  There have been several motions passed throughout the entire country.  We have not seen them.  We have no indication they are happening.  The line we got back is that there are appropriate measures in place.  The view of some local authority planners is that there is not.  What is the Department's view on that?  Will the Department be bringing forward guidelines and when will it be bringing them forward?  It is holding back the industry.  It is holding back the ability of local authorities to make proper planning permissions, when we take into consideration some of the decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent months.  It is a key issue in why the industry has not progressed, why some planning has not progressed and why some residents feel their voices have not been heard.  The industry can move forward.  It is a very important tool that the Department needs to come forward with.  The Department could say it is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but it is an important issue that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should look at and on which it should bring forward recommendations.<\/p> <p>  My final question is to Mr. Maguire on solar farms.  If the tariff issue were to be sorted tomorrow morning, when does he think they could be installed and what impact does he think it would have on the impending financial penalty issues?  What does he believe he can bring to the table regarding those financial penalties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will go to the Department first to deal with Deputy Ryan's questions and those of Senator Lombard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with Deputy Ryan's questions as best I can.  On the issue of the level of wind in the system, for us to have 40% renewable wind in the system, we have to have the capacity to take up to 75% at peak times.  The wind does not blow all the time so we have to take as much wind as we possibly can when the wind is peaking.  Currently the target is 40% for 2020.  In that consultation, we model at 45%, 50% and 55%.  It is not as if 40% is something that is chiselled in stone and which we see as immutable and unchangeable.  Going forward, we will certainly have to increase the level of renewable energy in the electricity sector.  Wind can be part of that.  Solar will be too.  The analysis of offshore wind shows the potential for 4,500 MW of offshore wind.  That was on the older, smaller turbine.  It is likely that number will be increased.  In terms of the ambition for 2030, decisions have not been made on that yet.  Ireland has to produce its draft national energy climate plan this year.  It will be set against the context of an EU ambition to start at 27%.  Yesterday the European Parliament opted for 35% and the Commission will likely cascade that down and look at how member states will contribute to it.  I cannot say it will be 70% in 2030 but certainly there is a recognition that we have to increase our renewable energy, particularly in transport and heat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Do we support the European Parliament's overall target of 35% for renewable energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Thankfully, that is a matter for the Minister and not me.

As the UK exits the EU, we will probably be the only member state using English as a first language.  We will also be the only one relying on common law.  We are generally exercised about how things are structured and about there being sufficient flexibility within the language of instruments so that we can actually deliver.  It is not an effort to weasel out, but a search for suitable language.  There was some media coverage at the time.  For instance, at one stage we sought to have the words \"at least\" removed.  Our reason for that was that we were concerned others would oppose it.  We felt that if the text was removed, the debate around that issue would be removed.  Others saw it differently and as us being hostile to the proposition.  That was very much not the case.<\/p><p> Senator Lombard asked about emissions.  I will leave emissions to my colleague but we have been very active with regard to Brexit.  We are very cognisant of the fact that we have an all-island single electricity market, which is probably the single greatest exemplar of a common market in Europe.  We have engaged with the European Commission, the UK and Northern Ireland.  We have had two civic dialogue events, one was a very wide event with very wide attendance and the second was more industry focused.  We wanted industry to come in and tell us how it saw the issues arising there.  We have surfaced the issues that are of concern to us.  The answers to those questions are not in our gift.  They very much depend on the final arrangement between the UK and the European Union.  We are conscious that for things like the single electricity market to work, there will need to be oversight mechanisms and common and level playing fields.  We will have to be EU compliant because we are staying in the Union.  We will need devices and mechanisms to that end.  We will continue to engage with the UK throughout the current process.  It is very important that the agreement reached before Christmas, apart from dealing with Irish issues, provides that Irish issues will remain a live dimension as sectoral issues are discussed.<\/p><p> On coal plants North and South, I acknowledge that the UK published a paper the week before last which said that it would have no more unabated coal.  To an extent, that reflects the age of its coal fleet.  Its coal fleet was generally built in the 1960s, whereas Moneypoint was built in the 1980s.  There is a significant age difference and there is an advantage to the UK being an early mover on that issue.  The White Paper provides that decisions will have to made on Moneypoint before the end of 2020, as it will come to the end of its natural life in 2025.  There is a real recognition that we may be ending coal-fired electricity generation at that point.  It will not be a simple issue however.  There is over 900 MW of generation capacity at Moneypoint.  It is at the end of the 400 kV link from the west coast to the east coast.  Moneypoint also represents one third of the rate base of County Clare.  There are significant economic and generation issues in managing the transition away from coal and into other fuels at Moneypoint.  I do not know if that fully answered the question.  I hope it did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Manley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Just to prove the point, 30% of our energy is produced in Cork.

There is an absence of national guidelines on planning and that is a matter of some concern.  However, as an industry we believe that the planning regime is sufficiently robust to filter out any poorly sited projects.  The main impact of large scale or utility scale solar energy generation is visual.  There are no emissions and no moving parts.  That is the key issue.  To that end, and in the absence of national guidelines, we have produced our own planning recommendations and guidelines.  We have sat down with senior officials from the relevant Department.  We have presented our guidelines to them and are hoping for feedback.  We engaged widely with An Taisce, Friends of the Earth, the EPA and various other bodies on this document.  We have sent it out to local authorities.  There is a statutory requirement for planning, but as an industry we have sought to raise the bar in terms of what we deem best practice and what we have seen from our experience in Europe in the past 20 years.  We have sought to bring those planning practices to Ireland where they are applicable.  We have done that as an industry.<\/p> <p>  With respect to what we can deliver, when we can deliver and how much it will cost, if we look at the order of merit of deploying renewables in Ireland, our wind resource is second to none in Europe, with the possible exception of Scotland.  In terms of the deployment of renewable energies that should be where we look first.  One of the key pillars of the Department's role is energy security, which includes having a diversity of energy generation in the mix.  After onshore wind, solar is the cheapest form of renewable generation in Ireland by some margin.  That is where we should go in the second instance.  On the mix of those two forms of generation, because of the Irish climate when it is windy we tend to have lower light levels and when we have high light levels, we tend to have lower wind levels.  The two kinds of generation are very complementary.  <\/p> <p>  From that perspective, geographically we also have the east and the south east coast.  The south coast is where the greatest solar resources are located.  It is also where there is a lot of grid capacity available at the distribution level.  Those assets - grid capacity and solar resources - are assets which wind energy cannot avail of, so again solar is a good fit there.  <\/p> <p>  What can we deploy?  On what we have in planning and in the grid at the moment, members will have heard numbers such as 6 GW in the grid queue and so on.  We have called for a lot of that speculative grid application.  With the regulator we have sought to have a group processing approach, GPA, or gate processing approach, which would filter out many projects.  We want to see planning as a filter so that only the real projects come forward.  Already, just looking at what will come through between now and the end of 2020, as an industry we could deliver 2 GW.  We already have line of sight to 1.5 GW.  In order to have a competitive auction for 1.5 GW, we need at least 2 GW ready to go with planning.  What does that equate to?  If we can deliver 1.5 GW by the end of 2020, what will that save us in terms of the shortfall on our 2020 targets?  Approximately 1% of that target equates to 1 GW of solar energy.  We could halve the potential shortfall.  If we look at a total shortfall of up to approximately &euro;420 million, we could potentially save the Exchequer more than &euro;200 million per annum at the cost of approximately &euro;15 million per annum on the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  Solar can deploy very quickly.  What is holding solar back on the grid side is the long lead-in, the switchgear and so on.  The reality is that we can still deliver that much at the distribution level within the timeframe, that is by 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Gannon want to come in at this point?

As such, I would not say that there is little activity or no incentivisation.<\/p><p> I was asked a specific question about what I would vote for tomorrow.  I am not sure.  I will get to the end of it.  Net metering has been an almost abject failure in the various European countries where it has been attempted.  Grant support is a case in point.  It is what we have and what we know.  A PSO exemption has been discussed in Ireland.  It would have a considerable cost in terms of the background systems and executing it would be challenging.  Generation tariffs have worked in some jurisdictions and not in others.  If asked tomorrow to make a decision, I would say that we should go with what we know until we see something better.  Unfortunately, that means grant systems.  While grant systems work and incentivise activity, they can become blunt over time and turn into inefficient market supports that are depended upon by a supply chain.  They need to have an end in sight.  Such systems need to prime a market without necessarily having the market resting on them.<\/p><p> Then there are the other issues at domestic and commercial scales that the supply chain and PV customers are mentioning.  On behalf of the Department, we hosted a workshop on microgeneration during the renewable energy share, RES, consultation.  We invited people to attend.  Separately, we suggested that the microgeneration community get together to decide what it should collectively submit to the RES and to outline the common challenges.<\/p><p> Planning remains a challenge not just in terms of the uncertainty around the conditions, but the uncertainty around the exemptions that are in place and whether they are still appropriate for updated technologies.  The quality and depth of the supply chain is a major issue.  What would happen if we turned on a massive tap of incentivisation tomorrow?  Even in our modest deep retrofit pilot, the quality has not been there to date.  It is not the supply chain's problem, but it needs to be developed over time.  We need to ensure that the designers and the people who will tie into the various ESB Networks boxes consider what the implementation of 30 or 40 of these devices in a housing estate that is just 45 houses big with one box at the end will entail.<\/p><p> In terms of the quality, specifications and standard of products entering the market, the SEAI's experience has been that, if one turns on the tap too quickly, the supply chain, through no fault of its own, has a challenge keeping up with demand.  There is a risk.  It happened with other technologies eight or ten years ago.  If the tap is turned on too quickly, it can discredit a technology or give people a first bite that is negative as opposed to positive.<\/p><p> We are pro-microgeneration once it is cost effective for the consumer and the community.  There are technical and economic challenges if microgeneration is just viewed from a cost-benefit analysis perspective, but there are social benefits in terms of the individual taking ownership of it in his or her home, as Deputy Dooley mentioned, and accepting other technologies and infrastructure.  Those benefits can be significant and provide a major opportunity for the supply chain to grow to a sustainable level.<\/p><p> The challenge for us is that, if one incentivises to a large degree at the start, the supply chain will not necessarily grow in a sustainable way.  That is part of what we are examining.  We are testing it, looking for the training and technical gaps and determining what sort of capacity is needed in light of those gaps.  Significant activity is under way, but there are challenges depending on the route one takes and the speed at which one turns on incentivisation, be it purely regulatory or purely incentives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Ryan, Mr. Garrett Blaney of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has indicated.

As part of that process, I have engaged with various European regulators on, among other matters, the question of distributed resources.  We have debated solar panels on people's roofs and the potential impact of electric vehicles, EVs, and electrification generally as it comes through.  The experience at European level has shown that there are good ways and bad ways of doing this and that we could incur significantly higher extra costs.  Mr. O'Shea referred to the need to spend much more money on systems and the network, but we need to be careful.  Electrification may be the cheapest solution for doing much more at a distribution level, but we need to approach it carefully and in a smart way.  Using smart meters and encouraging and allowing consumers to engage and be active players in the market will help with their costs as well as overall costs in the system.<\/p> <p>  As a regulator, we have been actively engaging with best practice.  We have some leadership to show in this regard.  There is no standard solution that will necessarily work.  Ireland can be a part of delivering that.  We have heard about new technologies like blockchain.  There are many clever technologies that we can access.  We have come in at a good time.  The reduction in the cost of the solar resource available in the system has been fundamental in recent years.  There is an opportunity for Ireland to tap into that.  Not only are we decarbonising, but we are doing so at the least cost and in a way that enhances the competitiveness of the economy and ensures that, rather than adding to consumer poverty, we enhance the consumer's overall cost position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Blaney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#O00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Well done to Mr. Blaney, the chairman of the board of regulators of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER.

We have just sent over one of our best grid people to run the UK's grid for it.  We are good at this, but we will no longer be good if we delay on solar.  Now is the time to do it.  While there is a risk to the industry and solar has to be built up, there is also a risk to the people in the industry who have been working on this for ten years and crying because every obstacle has been put in their way.  It is time for that to stop.<\/p> <p>  As we stated in our submission, there should be a support price on export only.  That encourages efficiencies and helps to fold the envelope and play our bit in a connected system that has to balance the grid locally.  It needs to go beyond a grant or community scheme.  Everyone needs to be involved because what Deputy Dooley said was true.  Ultimately, what matters in this is politics, specifically public and political support for a transition.  Technology is not the issue.  We will learn and make mistakes, but we must have public support.  We will get it when people feel like they are a part of it, understand it and benefit from it.  This will not just unlock solar generation, but also EVs, heat pumps, efficiencies, retrofits and everything else.  It will unlock the farming community, which has to be on the green side.  It already is, and it is begging for some kind of support for putting tech on a barn.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in the regulator's opinion regarding a support price on export only.  It would not have a large effect, and certainly not in the next five years.

I was asked to speak on Ireland's targets.  The EU emissions trading system, ETS, is an important element of that.  We did not create it, but it is a part of the regulatory mechanism with which we must deal.  In the past year, changes have been made to the ETS to increase the pace of reductions.  The ESB supported those changes.<\/p> <p>  As to the broader perspective, we have set out in our report, entitled Ireland's Low Carbon Future - Dimensions of a Solution, how we could see the energy system as a whole rather than just the electricity system being decarbonised between now and 2050.<\/p> <p>  Moneypoint was mentioned.  For us, it is a matter of when, not if, Moneypoint transitions away from coal.  Among the issues we are considering is the exact timing of that.  It is the youngest coal-fired power station on these islands.  Others can judge whether that fact is important, but it is important to recognise that Moneypoint is the largest single store of energy on this island.  Moneypoint can hold three months of fuel, which would be invaluable to the island if a security of supply issue arose.  That comment is just meant to balance the argument.  Moneypoint meets approximately 20% of our demand and acts as a good counterbalance that enables wind and other intermittent plants to operate.<\/p> <p>  We undertook a joint report in 2015 that indicated that, between 2008 and 2020, Moneypoint would save Irish consumers an average of &euro;200 million per year based on modelled prices.<\/p><p>ETS is important because it sets an overall volume of carbon that can be emitted over a period across Europe.  If we close Moneypoint before it is economically efficient to do so, we will lose the security supply benefit and the cost benefit to Irish customers, notwithstanding the fact that it is not clear it would impact positively on the environment.  That is because of the way the trading mechanism that is ETS works, whereby other coal plants across Europe, which may be far less efficient, will generate the carbon instead of Moneypoint.  It is important to understand all the issues around it.  The Department mentioned earlier that the White Paper indicates 2025 as a period and we are looking at the various options around that.  It is important to balance the security of supply issue, the cost issue and the fact that, due to the way ETS works, there would be no environmental benefit if we closed it in the morning.  The carbon that Moneypoint emits would be taken up by other power plants across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I will bring in the Irish Solar Energy Association next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#P00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>When I was Chairman of this committee in 2014, we had long and arduous discussions in this room around the issue of climate change legislation.  We found unanimity in the end and published a report which was widely welcomed.  I recall that the mantra at the time was that the clock was ticking.  It is now 2018 and we are edging ever closer to 2020.  In terms of the deficit where we miss our targets, we have a very strong and viable position in the Irish Solar Energy Association.  With the rapid deployment of solar projects, all depending on the outcome of RES, we could put 2 GW on the system.  Ours is the only technology which can provide new generation by 2020 in terms of planning, grid and rapid deployment.  A critical issue for us is the manner in which RES, once its gets the green light and comes back from the Directorate Generation for Competition in Brussels, focuses on the auction aspect of what is intends to do.  We have argued consistently for a technology-specific process which is key to ensuring we get new generation for solar and a native, viable solar industry up and running.<\/p> <p>  We have published our own documentation on community participation proposals which is available on our website.  In the context of popularising solar, we have a strong case around rooftop solar to complement the large-scale, ground-mounted projects some of our members have.  Rooftop solar is the way to create the energy citizen.  In effect, it democratises energy and allows people in their homes and businesses to generate their own electricity.  I welcome the fact that there is a role for the SAI in the RES document to develop microgeneration schemes.  That would be huge and useful to popularise the technology.  KPMG compiled a report a number of years ago on a brighter future which looked at many aspects of what solar can do for our economy not only in terms of foreign direct investment, but also in terms of job creation.  This was against the backdrop of a country which had seen its unemployment rate hit almost 16%.  It is now, thankfully, down to 6% and there is an ambition on the part of Government to see the figure reduced to zero.  With a strong and viable native solar industry, we can contribute, according to a conservative estimate, approximately 7,300 jobs per annum.  For every &euro;1 invested in solar, there is a gross value add of approximately &euro;3.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that we are having a wide ranging discussion with other significant stakeholders in the industry at the committee today.  To deploy solar and meet our 2020 targets, time is of the essence.  The sooner we get a policy support mechanism in place to see the advancement of large-scale, ground-mounted and rooftop solar, the sooner we can get the industry going to help to meet our climate targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Sharkey to give his final comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#P00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if Mr. Gannon put some structures in place to turn on the tap just a little.

Half the month is what we are working and, as such, we need Mr. Gannon to turn on the tap.  He should not be afraid that he will drown us.<\/p> <p>  We did not discuss curtailment, which is becoming a huge issue in a lot of countries where the level of wind is increasing.  It is a very fancy word for dumping electricity.  Much of the electricity which has been generated in the few weeks since Christmas has been dumped.  Why are we dumping electricity and then charging people 18.3 cent a unit?  My proposal on a future system for homes, which includes battery storage and off-peak metering using smart meters, would mean electricity could, instead of being dumped, be fed to businesses, homes and farms at a reduced rate.  However, we are way behind the curve as regards energy storage and I have heard no discussion about it here today.  Every large wind or solar project internationally is installing energy storage as part of the package.<\/p> <p>  Rooftop solar can be rolled out in significant quantities.  One is talking about up to 1 MW.  However, in Ireland, one is only allowed to put six panels on one's home without seeking planning permission.  It is a bit silly.  A farmer can only install 38 or 40 panels without seeking planning permission.  On the one side we are saying, \"Go ahead, here is your grant and incentive to install this stuff\", while on the other we are saying, \"No, you must apply for planning permission\".  That is a big turn-off for many businessmen who do not have the time.  We must look at our existing planning requirements for rooftop solar panels, which are very restrictive.<\/p> <p>  Last but not least, I have a quiz for the committee.  What caused the Great Famine of 1845?  The answer is that bad policy decisions caused the Famine.  A group of politicians and policymakers sat around in a room and said, \"We must keep exporting the food to meet our balance of payments, pay the rent, provide for the army and supply the British market\".  What caused the Famine to run on for five or six years was inaction and bad decisions.  I have been waiting ten years for a decision on solar PV.  I sold a brilliant business in 2009 thinking the next revolution was in renewable energy and I have been waiting ten years for it to take off in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Sharkey"},{"type":"speech","time":1516122000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Finally, I bring in Mr. Peter Harte of the Irish Wind Energy Association, who has indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011600002#P00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516122000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  Curtailment is something the wind industry has worked with over a number of years.  It is at a relatively low level of 3% to 4% currently and is projected to go to perhaps 5% by 2020.  It is by no means a limit on how much wind can be put on the system.  EirGrid's own good work on flexibility measures, the electrification of heat and transport in future, the provision of additional interconnection and, in due course, the provision of storage will mean we can get to 2030 at the 70% level.  We have done the work ourselves and EirGrid will back it up.  I think the regulator would see the same sort of numbers.  We can get to 2030 also with no lower amount of curtailment.  In due course, if solar goes to high levels, it will find the same problems.  We have a very clear vision that we can get to 70% without high curtailment by 2030.  Certainly, the onshore resource alone could probably get us there, but in due course the mix will no doubt widen to solar and offshore.

We were due to present this information in December of last year but, due to timing issues, our appearance was postponed.  Therefore, we are very pleased with the opportunity to appear today, and I thank the committee for its rapid rescheduling of same.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Ombudsman for Children's office is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children and, under section 7 of the Act, we promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children and young people in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our annual report, which was published in May 2017, lays out the main work of the office during 2016.  It shows another increase in the number of complaints received by the office and outlines the work we have done in raising awareness of children's rights through our rights education programme, the advice offered on upcoming legislation and other policy work.  I know all members have had access to our annual report but I will briefly mention a few of the key statistics from it.  In 2016 we received 1,682 new complaints, which is an increase of 3% on 2015 and a 47% jump since 2010.  Of those who contacted us, 78% were parents and, as has been the case for many years, education was the most complained about issue, covering 46% of our complaints.  Child protection and welfare accounted for 23% of the complaints, which represented a slight drop on the previous year.  Health complaints were up to 17% from 14%, and another area where we noted an increase was in housing and planning complaints, where there was an increase from 3% in 2015 to 5% in 2016.  The majority of people who contacted us came from the main urban centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 we interacted with more than 4,000 children and young people, many of whom took part in rights education workshops in our office, while we met others at events and seminars all over the country.  We advised on a range of legislation and policy in 2016, including the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as well as the consultation on the age of digital consent.  We also carried out a wide-ranging consultation with young people called Tune In, in which more than 2,000 young people responded to our questions about how they communicate and how they would like to receive information on their rights.<\/p> <p>  Having read our annual report, members will note that we have highlighted a number of key issues using case studies of complaints made to our office on behalf of children.  In the case of Ciara, a young girl in need of a hip scan, we found that the process of faxing referrals was resulting in errors and subsequent delays in diagnosis.<\/p><p>We asked the HSE to analyse all similar cases, and in the 2,000 it analysed it found the same problem had affected 20 other infants.  In this case, the HSE then put out a national order to stop faxing and introduced a new system.  This is an excellent example of how making a single complaint can improve a system for other children and their families.<\/p><p> Other case studies outlined in the report highlight the continuing struggle faced by children with disabilities and their families.  Children with disabilities continue to face barriers in trying to access services and live a normal life.  Committee members may have noted that yesterday we published an investigation involving a young girl, whom we have called Molly.  She is 14 and has Down's syndrome and severe autism.  She was abandoned at birth and has been in foster care since she was four months old.  We investigated the complaint made by Molly's foster mother about the level of support and services provided to Molly by the HSE and Tusla considering her disability.  This case is important not only for Molly, but for the 471 other children with severe and moderate disabilities who are in State care and who need additional supports.  This case, like those included in our annual report, highlights the need for increased and improved interagency co-operation to ensure the rights of children with disabilities are fully realised in Ireland.  It is also important to mention the urgent need to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to promote the rights of these young people.<\/p><p> Homelessness affecting all children is an issue that is not going away.  More than 3,300 children and young people in Ireland are homeless, trying to live a normal life while eating their dinner on their knees, sharing a single room with their family and having no space of their own.  I have been clear in outlining my concerns about the issue of homelessness and how it affects children and young people.  I do not believe the measures in place to tackle homelessness have fully addressed the disproportionate and long-term impact homelessness has on children.  I have met the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, but still remained concerned about how children and families will be helped out of this nightmare and how long it might take.  I appreciate that family hubs are being rolled out to address the issue of appropriate emergency accommodation for families who are homeless and that they offer a better alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts.  However, a commitment on the length of time that children and families will be expected to spend in these family hubs before finding a permanent home is needed.  There is also an urgent need to implement national quality standards for homeless services.<\/p><p> Committee members will see from our annual report that children with mental health issues still have to jump hurdles to access necessary supports.  The services provided for children need to go to the children who need them when they are needed and in the way in which they are needed.  This is not what is happening.  At present, a child must take what the system can offer and make do with what is available.  The child is doing all the adapting.  Children should not have to wait until they reach breaking point before they get some type of help.  I know committee members are aware of the various committees, reports and task force dealing with mental health issues.  I am sure they share my concerns that all of these mechanisms should not only work together, but lead to action for those children who are very much in need.  In this regard, I commend the work of Senator Freeman and her committee last year.<\/p><p> The national youth mental health task force report published in December included some very positive recommendations.  The recent establishment of a specific Oireachtas committee on the future of mental health is to be welcomed.  Again, I implore all Members of the Houses to demand results and outcomes for our young people.  Many young people have nobody to speak on their behalf or they do not feel able to speak out.  Oireachtas Members are their voices in the highest place in the land.  Please use that power effectively.  My office is undertaking consultations directly with children and young people who rely on mental health services.  There is no doubt whatsoever the service they receive and the supports they avail of now have a profound impact on their long-term outcomes.<\/p><p> Education remains a key issue for the office due to the number of complaints relating to education and due to the key legislation in train.  It is not that surprising that many of our complaints relate to education considering the amount of time young people spend in school.  It is also worth pointing out that many of the education complaints we receive overlap with health, disability or transport issues.  Our recent School Transport In Focus report is testament to this crossover.<\/p><p> The education (parent and student charter) Bill, which, to our delight, has been renamed the education (student and parent charter) Bill and which puts children at the centre, has been broadly welcomed by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  We believe promoting consistency in complaints handling, improving engagement and addressing issues as early as possible will minimise reliance on formal complaints procedures in the education system.  If passed, this may, in time, reduce the number of education complaints we receive.<\/p><p> Child protection is always one of my key concerns, and while there was a slight drop in the number of complaints relating to it in 2016, 23% remains a large proportion.<\/p><p>I have been vocal previously in my criticism of Tusla's delay in dealing with complaints which come to my office.  However, I am happy to acknowledge a marked improvement in this regard for 2016.  The introduction of mandatory reporting may result in an increase in referrals to Tusla and, perhaps, a subsequent increase in complaints to my office and it is essential, therefore, that adequate resources are provided to deal with this.  The reporting of any and all child protection concerns can, in my view, only be a good thing.<\/p><p> Another area I would like to mention briefly is health.  In 2016, we saw an increase in the number of health complaints received by the office.  The health system is still not operating to a satisfactory level and too many children are still getting caught up in administrative problems that are impacting their treatment.  Never has this been clearer than in the case of children suffering from scoliosis.  In 2016, we received a number of complaints about this issue and in March 2017 we published a report highlighting scoliosis as a children's rights issue.  Many commitments have been made by the Government to meet the demand for scoliosis treatment but, unfortunately, there are still issues for children waiting for diagnosis or surgery.  I am concerned that while the numbers on waiting lists are decreasing, children whose surgery has been outsourced to the UK, France or Germany, on arrival in those countries are being deemed unsuitable.  Where do those children fit into the waiting lists on their return?  We cannot allow waiting lists and administrative practices to worsen an already terrible condition.<\/p><p> The final area I would like to comment on is direct provision.  Members will note that in our annual report for 2016 and in previous annual reports we have called for children in direct provision to have the same access to complaints procedures as other children living in Ireland.  In April 2017, the necessary steps were taken to allow us to begin to accept these complaints.  Since that time, myself and my team have travelled across the country and visited all of the centres, including the emergency reception orientation centres, EROCs, where children are living.  By and large, we observed extremely passionate and hard working staff in direct provision centres and EROCs but we were shocked at the difference in standards between the centres.  It seems to be pot luck whether a child ends up in a warm, pleasant, well-resourced centre or a centre where facilities are simply not to the same standard.  There continues to be a reluctance among those living in direct provision and EROCs to come forward and make complaints, which is of concern to me.  It is also clear that direct provision allowance is not adequate to support normal family living and that the provision to allow people in direct provision to work will not in and of itself solve that problem.  These are only a few of the issues that have come to my attention since April 2017.  We will continue to work in this area in 2018.<\/p><p> I thank members of the committee for taking the time to listen to my contribution, which I hope clearly sets out the work we are doing to promote children's rights and a child centred approach across the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516109400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>As we must vacate this room at 3.15 p.m. I propose to allocate five to six minutes speaking time to each member.

There will likely be a slow change.<\/p> <p>  Mandatory reporting has been well flagged but the specific implications for individuals is still coming to the fore as schools re-open and the measure comes into effect.  It is vital that this is adequately resourced from a Tusla point of view and that everybody is aware of the implications for them of being a mandatory reporter.  We also need to review this measure on an annual basis to determine the impact of it.  It is often lost in the argument about resources that the rationale for this is because we have failed our children so often before.<\/p> <p>  Aside from mandatory reporting, there are other good elements in the Bill which allow Tusla and other people to analyse the safety statements and work of organisations, including religious orders, sporting organisations and so on.  These are extra safeguards that will come to the fore over time.<\/p><p>It is an active and important aspect of the Bill.  I welcome its introduction.  I look forward to seeing the impact and if it does need to be further resourced, that must be followed through on by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  From my point of view, I look forward to it making a positive impact because its essence is there still are children who have not been able to come forward.  That is the key thing.  If a teacher has a good relationship with a child, he or she is more than likely to be the person.

I have met a number of very articulate and intelligent young people who are as Irish as can be yet their fear of being deported to a place they have never even seen just because their parents originally came from there is palpable.  I contend that members of the Oireachtas must find a way to legislate for such instances.  Politicians have spent a lot of energy trying to legislate for the undocumented Irish in America.  Can an amnesty or legislative option be provided that will give undocumented children here the opportunity to come clean and emerge out of the shadows?  It behoves us to do so.  There are 5,000 children in this situation, which is more than are in direct provision and lots of other areas.  Such children have a huge contribution to make to this State.<\/p><p>However, after they finish the leaving certificate there is no personal public service, PPS, number or opportunity to be in third level education where they can thrive.  We are losing a great deal of opportunity in that way as well.  I do not have an answer, but I wonder if a conversation should be conducted in the Houses of the Oireachtas to try to do something about that.<\/p><p> Regarding Oberstown, 2016 was certainly a tumultuous year.  I am aware that both the director and representatives of the management appeared before the committee in the recent past.  Again, we engage actively with Oberstown.  We have an in-reach there on a monthly basis and we engage with the young people directly across the different units.  I have regular meetings and ongoing contact with both the chairman and the director.  From our point of view, there are always things that could be improved.  We are awaiting the publication of the judgment from the High Court.  What has been reported in the newspapers highlighted concerns around the quality of reports, policies, administration and the like.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was also very critical of some areas.  We are very much aware of that and we look into it any time we engage with Oberstown.  However, we put an emphasis on trying to meet and be a resource to the young people as quickly as possible when we are out there, to let them know we are available.  It is same as we are doing with direct provision - creating a relationship with unit managers and ensuring that if people wish to make complaints they can come to us.<\/p><p> The overall concept of Oberstown is moving in the right direction but there is a great deal of work to be done in that regard.  Deputy Sherlock talked about the non-publication of the report by Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nicholas Hardwick.  That is unfortunate.  When one seeks transparency from that organisation, it is crucial to call in such experts.  It is a shame that the publication has not happened, whatever the legal advice.  I am aware that the authors were happy to work with Oberstown to try to find a way to publish a report of some type, so it is unfortunate that we have a set of recommendations with no context.  I am concerned about that.<\/p><p> With regard to Tusla, my colleague, Nuala Ward, the director of investigations, knows the details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#P01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>We have a positive engagement with Tusla.

In terms of the complaints we receive from Tusla, it is noteworthy that a number of them are directly from children who are in care because they are supported by various advocacy groups to come to us.

It is difficult to listen to the sadness that exists.<\/p> <p>  I have a three-part question regarding Dr. Muldoon's capacity to handle these complaints.  First, is 1,600 a large number?  Given that there are over 1 million children in this country, that does not appear to be a massive figure.  It is a terrible amount but I am surprised.  One of the groups of people I deal with - I call them the warriors - are parents who have children in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, system and in the disability services.  There are 12,000 of them, so is 1,600 a big figure?  Second, how does the Ombudsman for Children promote itself?  Several people have contacted me in the past couple of months about certain difficulties.  I am sorry that I keep forgetting to refer them to the Ombudsman for Children.  Dr. Muldoon says that children know about him, but we need to get his name out to the parents to let them know he will handle these matters.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to where there is a complaint about, for example, access to disability services.  I am aware of a child who is waiting six years to be assessed.  We believe he is on the autistic spectrum.  If that complaint went to Dr. Muldoon's office, how quickly would it be resolved?  Is it resolved more quickly because he is addressing it with the HSE or a disability service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#Q00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>One of the difficulties with any complaints service is that it is hard to know how many complaints we should be getting.  Certainly, it has been a priority of mine to increase awareness of the office.  In that regard we are, thankfully, bringing in two new team members in our education and participation office which will increase our opportunities to do outreach work in different parts of the country over the next year.  They will come into the office in February.  We also mentioned the &quot;tune in&quot; consultation which allows us to try to meet young people where they are.  We went around the country and asked where they wanted to hear about this.  Surprisingly, the majority agreed that they wanted to hear about it from teachers at both secondary and national school level.  That was followed very closely by those wishing to hear from parents.  As such, we have to target those people.  We will target them through YouTube clips and we have hired a new social media officer and created Snapchat and Instagram accounts, albeit I am not 100% <i>au fait<\/i>with those.  Those are the places they want to hear from us.  We asked them where they would look for the things they needed and those are the places.  We are trying to create social media activity on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat so that young people who need to know about us and their rights will find it on their platforms.<br\/><br\/>We are trying to raise awareness all the time and we are engaging with adults at all levels.  I have a very close relationship with teachers' associations, including those for principals and the INTO.  We engage with them so that they are aware we are available.  We also engage with parents' groups and advocacy groups like the Warriors and associations for the parents of children with special needs.  I engage with them all the time and attend the annual general meetings of their organisations.  We all try to raise awareness as often as we can.  It is difficult to know when we will have reached the right level of awareness.  In fact, I do not think we ever will.  The whole essence of what we do should also mean we are increasing our complaints because we should always become aware and the more we are aware, the more new people will know about us.  The essence of this work is that we are only sought when someone needs us.  What we have to do, however, is plant enough seeds so that people know about us now even if they do not need us until ten years later.  I am spending a lot of time trying to meet young people in secondary schools.  I tell them that they will be the parents in ten years time.  If they know about us and children's rights, they will be the ones who can fight for their children's rights in a different way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1516109400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>What about the speed of complaints?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>We have a target of 12 to 14 months for a full investigation where everything works smoothly and all the organisations work with us.

On awareness, I regularly point out that school journals are under-used to provide children with an idea of their rights.  One does not want them all marching up and down on strike over everything that might be listed in the journal, but it would certainly raise awareness of rights.  It would be a simple tool to use if schools got on board.<\/p><p>I am delighted that we have had an Ombudsman for Children in this country for 14 years now.  We are eventually catching up with what children are privileged to have in other countries.  It is not a privilege, it is just a default position for them.<\/p><p> I wanted to ask about the mental health of our children in care and about the nature of the mental health complaints.  Senator Joan Freeman and myself were on the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  Are the complaints similar to what we heard there about access, continuity of care and time?  Are the complaints similar to that or is there anything unique in what children are putting forward to the ombudsman?  Is the number of complaints rising?  I would imagine it is because of the demand on services.  Does Dr. Muldoon agree that any such rise is because of demand on services or is it just because of particular people falling through the cracks?  <\/p><p> My other question was on disability.  Some 8% of children in care have a severe or moderate disability.   Does Dr. Muldoon have an idea of the timeline for the review which the HSE and Tusla have agreed to so we can all have a look at it?  I am delighted that Dr. Muldoon raised the issue of direct provision.  It has been referred to in the past.  It was established 20 years ago.  Children have been born and raised in that system.  It has been described as State-sanctioned child poverty and exclusion.  Those in the system now have the same access to the Ombudsman for Children for complaints.  On his visits and his travels throughout the country, did he speak to children directly?  The children who are probably most at risk are the children who are here alone and have no family around them.  Would he have had contact with them as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I love the idea of the school journal.  I will certainly steal that and see if we can get engaged with it in some way or other.  The mental health complaints are, as the Senator mentioned, on access to services, continuity of services when moving from child to adult services, and continuity when being transferred from one area to another.  Timelines are also a huge issue.  I will ask Ms Ward to come in if there are more issues on top of that.<\/p> <p>  On the overall mental health system, the work that Senators Devine and Freeman did is huge.  They identified that we do not have enough staff.  We do not have the staffing in the right place.  We do not have it in primary care where we need to prevent mental health issues.  There are difficulties with diagnosis and with consistency between child and adolescent mental health services teams.  One might diagnose a child as being ready to go in for an overnight bed and another might say that diagnosis does not fit, so the child does not get the bed.  Those issues are coming up continuously.<\/p> <p>  When I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who had responsibility for mental health at that time, she talked about at least five or six unfillable posts for psychiatrists.  These are posts which have not been filled for more than five years.  No organisation or business in the world would leave its offices open for five years without having found another way to fill the gap.  It is doing a huge disservice to our children in that area.  Up to now the clinical lead has always had to be a psychiatrist.  As I have suggested before, I wonder if there are other professionals who could take that lead for certain stages and at certain times.  If we look to other countries some have used psychologists to offer medication.  Certain nursing professionals have been allowed to dispense medication.  It may not just be about medication.  There may be other issues. <\/p> <p>  We have to look at the system as needing an overall change.  In that particular Seanad committee the Senator brought in some great witnesses.  They were fantastic.  There were a lot of good ideas which could be used.  Up until now we have been continuously trying to fix a broken system as opposed to seeing how we could look at the issue differently.  Primary care is a crucial part of that.  Tusla has talked about establishing what it calls therapy teams, which would include a range of therapists such as play therapists, drama therapists, art therapists and family therapists.  There would be a range of people who could intervene in a different way at a much earlier stage.  Such teams would not cost the earth.  That would make a huge difference at the primary care level.  Within CAMHS, there is never going to be enough psychiatrists.  From the people I have met, it sounds like 80% of all psychiatrists who train in Ireland go abroad.<\/p><p>One will never fill the vacant places if that continues to be the situation.  We must, therefore, acknowledge that and consider putting somebody else in place or allowing another professional to lead the team.  We have received complaints concerning children who have been left for possibly four or five days in a bed, waiting for a consultant to assess the child after he or she has come into an emergency department and said he or she is suicidal.  That is not appropriate and is very far from the right way to be child-centred.  Such a child is in the worst case in his or her life and the worst situation he or she can think of.  He or she feels ready to take his or her own life but we are doing them a huge disservice because we do not have enough consultants and only consultants are allowed to assess such children.  We are traumatising such children again and are, essentially, locking them up in a bed when they should be supported in some other way.  It is a result of our system and the way the legislation is set up that we are tied into that but that legislation could be changed within a year or two if we needed to and there was a will to do so.  I am not saying what professional should be given the responsibility of treating such children but if one profession is not creating enough new staff to fill that space, we have to widen it for the sake of the children, even if only temporarily.  Senator Devine has got her finger exactly on the button in regard to the complaints we receive.  It is a crisis that is long overdue fixing.<\/p><p> I have also called for a version of A Vision for Change solely dealing with children to be generated.  That would change the focus because one would then assess, evaluate, fund and resource it in a different way because they will be treated as children and as rights holders in their own right.

We are also clear, however, that nobody should be there for more than six months at the most.  Within that timeframe family hubs should be comply with the standards. We also feel that the family hubs options are poised to be very similar to direct provision; we created a very good system for what we thought was going to be the very small number of people who were to come in to direct provision.  It could be very difficult to move on from the family hubs option.  We have specifically asked the Minister to tell us how long people are in family hubs.  The statistics will often look at those who are in hotels and about the success of moving people in to family hubs, but not for how long.  We now need to know the numbers of every family have been in a family hub.  Anyone who has been there for longer than six months should be a priority to move on again.  As the family hub option is a better service it could easily become institutionalised.  For a lot of people a family hub could be a good place to stay, so we need to be careful of this also.  It is our view that it should only be a stop-gap that leads to a more permanent solution.  The effort around the creation of social housing and the move to Government-funded housing, as opposed to private sector housing, is the way forward and needs to be prioritised so we can move these people, under our own steam, to social housing as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>   I will ask my colleague Ms Ward to speak about the national quality standards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>As members may be aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office published an investigation statement last year on the quality of accommodation experienced by a woman and her children as they were homeless for nearly 20 months.<\/p><p>They were staying in hotel accommodation and described stained mattresses, cramped overcrowded rooms and how they had to move on multiple occasions.

I will make sure that, in all my other appearances before the committee in the coming year, the members will get my statement when they need it and when I have seen it, as has been the case in the past.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here to deal with both the tracker mortgage issue and the Our Public Service 2020 initiative.  I acknowledge the work of the committee in all its efforts to bring the tracker scandal to the fore and the progress it has made, in particular by taking testimony from people who have been significantly harmed by the unacceptable actions of banks.  I assure committee members and the public that the Government is treating this matter very seriously and is determined that the situation be resolved to the satisfaction of impacted customers as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Owing to the work of the Central Bank, particularly in its implementation of the industry-wide tracker mortgage examination, it has been clearly demonstrated that mortgage lenders failed significantly in their regulatory and contractual responsibilities to many tracker mortgage borrowers.  The failure of the banks in this regard has imposed significant harm on their customers.  It is now their responsibility to put that right and to do so without further delay. <\/p><p> The fair treatment of consumers is a key requirement of the financial services regulatory frameworks and the Central Bank consumer protection code.  The code requires all residential mortgage lenders to act fairly and honestly in the best interests of their customers and not to mislead their customers about the products they provide.  It also requires lenders to make full disclosure of all relevant information to a consumer in a way which seeks to inform the consumer and to enable a consumer to make an informed decision before entering into or changing a loan or other financial services agreement.  Through their treatment of some of their mortgage customers, lenders have shown a complete disregard for the code and have demonstrated that within these financial institutions ethical and cultural issues remain that need to be addressed.  The Central Bank has for some time made clear to lenders that they had and have a duty to act in the best interests of their consumers when recommending that a borrower switch a tracker mortgage to another type of mortgage product.<\/p><p> Prior to the commencement of the industry-wide tracker investigation, the Central Bank identified and pursued a number of tracker-related failings with a number of mortgage lenders.  These failures related to issues ranging from a lack of transparency for the borrower, a failure to fully inform customers of the consequences of switching from a tracker mortgage, the application of incorrect tracker rates and a failure to afford customers their contractual entitlements to specified tracker interest rates.  At the same time, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was receiving individual tracker mortgage-related complaints.  The Ombudsman adjudicated on these cases.  In addition, some of these cases came before the courts.  The growing number of issues relating to tracker mortgages raised concerns in the Central Bank that there may have been other tracker-related issues.  As a consequence of this, the Central Bank announced in October of 2015 that it had commenced a broader industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage-related issues.<\/p><p> The system-wide review was intended to cover, among other things, the transparency of communications with and the contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.  This has become the most complex and significant consumer protection review ever undertaken by the Central Bank.  It covered 15 lenders who may at the time have sold a tracker mortgage product, from the time the lender commenced selling tracker mortgages until December 2015, and involved the review of more than two million accounts by lenders.  As such, it covers both banks and other related mortgage lenders and also includes lenders who no longer provide new mortgage credit.  It also covers mortgages which have been redeemed and borrowers whose tracker mortgages have been transferred to another creditor.  The industry-wide examination requires all lenders to examine the extent to which they have been meeting their contractual obligations to their tracker mortgage customers or their compliance with their obligations under the Central Bank's consumer protection code.  <\/p><p> The Central Bank has published a number of update reports since it began its work, the latest of which came last December.  The latest update in the case showed that approximately 26,600 customers have been identified as having been impacted pursuant to the industry-wide examination.  This is an increase of 13,600 on the position as outlined in the earlier update in October.  The acceptance of further impacted tracker mortgage accounts by lenders, such as the 6,000 additional impacted accounts accepted by the Bank of Ireland in December, is proof that the Central Bank's strategy of continuously challenging lenders is having important benefits for consumers.  In total, 33,700 customers have been identified as having been impacted owing to mortgage failures.  This includes the 7,100 impacted tracker borrowers that were identified prior to the commencement of the industry-wide examination.  The Central Bank now believes the vast majority of impacted tracker mortgage customers have been identified.  It will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by lenders.  Following the Central Bank's October progress update, and owing to my and the Government's concern on the very slow progress on the provision of revision and compensation to impacted customers, I met with the CEOs of the five banks and made clear to them that all affected customers are to be identified and provided with appropriate redress and compensation as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>While some payments had been made at that time, they were small in number, they were too low, and many impacted borrowers were still unclear as to whether they would hear from their lender.  Following these meetings, the banks in question made certain and specific commitments with regard to the payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers.  I note that in December, the Central Bank confirmed that the five main mortgage lenders were on course to meet their October commitments, and that known issues around disputed groups in respect of certain lenders had been resolved to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>As of the end of December, approximately &euro;250 million in redress and compensation has been paid to 12,900 customers, as identified from the examination.  This includes payments to 3,700 impacted accounts identified since last September.  This is in addition to the &euro;47 million awarded in compensation and redress.  This payment to outstanding impacted borrowers is a key requirement, and it must be a practical demonstration of the regret that banks are now expressing for the harm they have inflicted on their impacted tracker borrowers. <br\/><br\/>The level of compensation offers are in the first instance a matter for the individual mortgage lender.  It is the lenders that caused the harm to their customers, and therefore the primary responsibility for putting that right should rest with the lenders.  The level of compensation should be proportionate to the harm and to the stress caused, and individual lenders should have regard to this when they make compensation payments to their customers.  The provision of fair and appropriate compensation offers upfront will minimise the risk of causing further inconvenience and hurt to impacted customers, and will go some small way towards giving a practical expression to the words of regret heard in recent months.  Of course, in more difficult cases, such as those where people lost their homes, the lender will need to consult closely with the impacted borrowers on the level of detriment which has occurred and, therefore, the total level of redress and compensation which is appropriate in their particular circumstances.  However, urgent consideration should be given to these cases by the banks, and they should not be deferred and put to the end of the line for payment. <br\/><br\/>It is also important to have an independent appeals process in place to deal with the customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress package they receive from lenders, and the Central Bank tracker redress framework<b><\/b>provides for this process.  This will give any customer the right to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation offered.  This can in the first instance be the appeals panel provided for under the tracker framework, but impacted tracker borrowers also have the right to take their course to the Financial Services Ombudsman or ultimately to the courts. <br\/><br\/>A fundamental element of the redress and compensation process is that the upfront payment by a lender cannot be reduced in any subsequent appeal made by the borrower, either through the appeals process under the tracker examination framework, or ultimately the ombudsman or the courts.  The detailed appeals process set out in the Central Bank's framework for conducting the tracker examination allows borrowers to take the matter further without risk to themselves if they consider that the level of upfront payment is not appropriate in their particular case.  This appeals process will also allow the individual borrower to set out the full individual circumstances, and to set out in detail the full harm imposed by them on the lender and consequently why a higher level of payment may be appropriate. <br\/><br\/>In terms of enforcement, I believe the existing supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank are strong and should be used to punish wrongdoing when supported by evidence.  The Central Bank has also demonstrated that it is willing to use the full extent of its powers, as evidenced by its imposition in 2016 of a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million on Springboard Mortgages Limited for serious failings.  The Central Bank has also advised that it is pursuing enforcement investigations in relation to Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank, and has commenced another enforcement investigation.  The Central Bank has stated that it expects that all the main mortgage lenders will face enforcement investigations in due course.  The Central Bank also has statutory reporting obligations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or another relevant statutory agency where information obtained by it, at any stage prior to, during or after an investigation gives rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence may have been committed.<\/p><p> In light of this appalling behaviour, I have taken a number of further actions.  I have mandated, under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank to prepare a report on the current culture and behaviour and the associated risks in the retail banks and actions that banks may take to ensure that customer interests are better prioritised in the future.  On foot of this report, the Government will determine whether any additional legislative and regulatory changes are needed to enhance accountability in the banks.  In addition, I announced two further measures, namely, to double the level of compensation to &euro;500,000 that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may award to a consumer who has been adversely affected by the action of a financial services provider and to appoint two new members to the Central Bank Commission who have a strong consumer protection profile.  <\/p><p> I also note and welcome the initiative from the banking industry to establish an Irish banking standard board to broadly mirror the approach adopted in the UK.  However, this is an initiative from the banking sector and it will not minimise or reduce any existing or proposed legislative or regulatory change.  <\/p><p> The examination has laid bare the facts that very poor cultural and governance issues still exist within lending institutions in Ireland post the banking crash and that if banks are to regain the trust of consumers, they must be prepared to change their attitude significantly.  Customers of these lenders have been treated appallingly and, in some cases, have lost their homes, either directly or indirectly, due to the shameful behaviour of their lenders.  This behaviour is simply unacceptable.  <\/p><p> The Government will continue to support the Central Bank in its efforts to complete the tracker examination as soon as possible and I will receive a further update at the end of March of this year.  If further sufficient progress regarding the payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers has not been made at that point, the Government will be prepared to consider further possible actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Minister and his officials are very welcome to this meeting.

In the following period of fewer than three months prior to the end of December, that number had more than doubled from 13,000 to 26,600.  An extra 13,600 were identified on top of the 13,000 in the first two years of the examination.  Therefore, something changed within a very short period.  The Central Bank has not minced its words and it is to its credit that it has engaged in straight talking, of late at least, on this issue.  The evidence from the Central Bank indicates that the banks have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to identify the right customers to whom to provide redress and compensation.  In the Minister's view, what led to such an about-turn and such a dramatic increase in the number of customers identified?

The first is the root cause of this, that is, the behaviour that led to people being treated wrongly and unfairly at great cost to themselves, both financially and from a health perspective.  The second matter that was of equal concern to me was the reaction of the banks to the Central Bank probe and the difficulties to which the Central Bank referred on a number of occasions towards the end last year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the number of affected accounts went up from 13,000 to 26,600.  Since we last engaged on this matter and since last September alone, a further 13,600 customers have now been accepted by the lenders into the redress and compensation scheme.  I said then that what was of equal concern to me in treating fairly the people who have been identified is identifying who else was treated unfairly by the banks.<\/p><p> As for what changed, I believe the Central Bank's investigation was making progress at the time.

Their human stories probably spoke louder than any words any politician, banker or central banker could come up with.  However, even according to the last update from the Central Bank in December, there are still 13,700 - presumably the number has not changed dramatically - identified affected customers who await redress and compensation.  Redress is them being paid the money they were overcharged, that they should never have been overcharged, and then there is the compensation, which can vary by 10%, 20% or perhaps 30%.  Many of them will want to know from the Minister, who is the person with ultimate responsibility, when every customer affected by the tracker mortgage scandal will get their money back and be appropriately compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#L00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>On the deadline I have set in regard to conclusion of the matter overall, I have referred to March in the different statements I have made on the matter but I stress that my strong view is that everybody should be given both redress and an initial offer of compensation as soon as possible.

We make the laws and this and the previous Oireachtas have decided that this type of behaviour is not theft, whereas if this was in Iceland it would be considered theft.  If it was America, bankers would be walked out of their institutions wearing handcuffs.  What are we going to do to ensure that it is deemed theft?  We are talking about &euro;1 billion.

They do not want this swept under the carpet.<\/p> <p>  That takes me to the final question on the issue of compensation and of being put back on the appropriate tracker rate.  We had a motion passed in the D&aacute;il.  I tabled an amendment to Deputy McGrath's motion in the D&aacute;il, which proposed to \"ensure all customers are put back onto the rate applicable as per their contract\".  I am sure the Minister knows, because the committee knows, there are countless people out there who have been offered redress and compensation but are being put back on a rate they completely and utterly dispute.  There is an issue with the prevailing rate at the time.  In some cases, rates are 2% and 3% above what they believe should have been the tracker rate at the time.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kissane, who comes in before the committee, has been a leading light in this and has argued this point very passionately.  Is this Minister dealing with the issue?

It is 10%, 15% and even 20%, and &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 is being offered in compensation for money that was taken from people at a time of deep austerity.  I will not rehearse what these families went through because we all know these individual stories.  The type of compensation being offered by these financial institutions to their victims is pathetic.  Will the Minister be the person to take on the five institutions, particularly AIB and Permanent TSB, on the issue of the prevailing rate?

That is, effectively, a similar thing to what Governor Lane is saying.  What the Minister said earlier about a potential tension between the perceived responsibilities of public interest directors, their responsibilities to the banks and the public interest was illustrative because for some reason banking interest is not identical to public interest.  It is separate.  Banking interest exists to maximise their profit.

This is quite central to capitalism.  It is quite central to the idea of private for-profit corporations; the very nature of their existence means they seek profitability even if it is to the detriment of their customers.  That happens right across the market in many different ways but it is particularly extreme in the banks.  The other point is that AIB and PTSB are not privately held companies; they are publicly owned companies.  They are publicly owned companies without public interest directors or any directors from the State currently operating on them.  Throughout the course of this time, the Government and the State and the public had ownership of a large portion of the banking sector in Ireland and did absolutely nothing with it.  It did not do anything with the public interest directors or the fact we own the banks.  Is that not a fundamental flaw?  The culture of running the banks for profit came from the Government which owned the banks and which said it wanted them to return to profitability.  I do not mean that the Government wanted them to screw the customers in the way that happened with tracker mortgages.

In order to hit the kind of balance the Deputy is referring to, we need strong regulation and independent institutions like the Central Bank.  Where banks are different from many other companies is their viability and that what they do is fundamentally interwoven into modern economies.

It is not just the long-term consequences, the short-term consequences when our banks were unprofitable and unable to fund themselves did huge damage to our economy and changed the nature of our country.

Does the Minister not agree that that and the subsequent scandals mean the private sector model of banking ownership has failed and that the tension that exists between the public interest and the banking interest is a fundamental problem?

It was done by changes in the regulatory environment.  For example, the amount of resourcing that is available to the Central Bank has now doubled versus where we were in 2009 precisely because of our efforts to tackle cultural change.  My view is what we were doing then is talking about a set of cultures that led our banks to lend in a way that was not sustainable.  Efforts were made to tackle and change that.

I see the establishment of this organisation fitting in with the report I will receive on banking culture in the middle of the year.  I see it as part of how we respond to the intangible issues that contribute to difficulties we want to be improved and tackled.<\/p> <p>  On the first part of the Senator's question, we need banks that are competitive, profitable and sustainable in Ireland because if we do not have them, we will not be able to meet the investment and lending needs of our economy to meet the aspirations that I, and I am sure, the Senator have for it in the future.  As I deal with this and other matters, I am always aware if that is an issue.  One thing I want to be clear on is that I would not accept in any way that there is a link between dealing with this issue and the journey toward competitive interest rates within the Irish economy.  This matter must be dealt with in the context of the balance sheets of banks.  I support other initiatives which, over time, will allow interest rates in Ireland to move towards the EU average, although they are driven by issues to which I have already referred in terms of the quantity of non-performing loans and the fact that, historically, we have had quite a concentrated banking market in Ireland compared with other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Does the Minister agree with the AIB plan regarding VAT reduction in the sector that was mooted at the weekend in the media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Can I come back-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Has AIB presented the Minister with that plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>No, it has not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>If it were to present the plan to the Minister in terms of VAT reduction, is it something-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#W00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I will get more information and come back to the Senator.

The improvement of the balance sheets of our banks, due to the impacts of economic growth and non-performing loans being carefully dealt with, should have an effect on interest rates offered to new and existing customers.

At various stages during these committee hearings, members were assured that the peak had been reached in relation to case numbers, and that \"This was it\", only to be told a short time later of the huge increases in the number of those affected.  We are now at the level of numbers that had been predicted by Padraic Kissane when he appeared before the committee.  This was a figure that had not been accepted by the banks.  As we commence 2018 and these hearings, I will give a flavour of the correspondence I have received by email.  This individual was put back on to a tracker mortgage in 2016 and continued to contact the bank to find out when the bank would repay the money, when compensation or redress would be paid and so on.  Ulster Bank kept on telling this person that it could not tell as it did not know.  This email is dated 11 January.  No one could tell her and no one could answer the questions.<\/p><p>I have received another email from another bank customer who was put back on a tracker mortgage by KBC when the person was confirmed last week as being an impacted case.  This only happened after this customer turned up in the Public Gallery here when the bank was before this committee.  This person has two other mortgage accounts with KBC and these have not yet been confirmed as being impacted or not.  It is important to note that on the date KBC was before the committee, the bank told us nothing.  It refused to tell the committee anything.  From the emails that are starting to come in now at the beginning of 2018, we can see there is ongoing frustration and anger with the banks in not dealing with all of the cases.  This is the fear I have.  There is also a continued reluctance on the part of the banks to show any sign of co-operation.  They have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to this point.

To find young men and women in the banking sector being encouraged to go down the route they are going in how they deal with customers is shocking in itself.  It will leave a legacy in our banks, that may well employ these people, that will continue this attitude towards customers.  It has been and continues to be very difficult for people to engage with them.  We are at a stage now within the economy where people are having to engage with these organisations.  In whatever way we can we should consider legislation that would force them to look at customers' rights and their obligations to ensure those rights are protected.  That does not happen; in fact it is quite the opposite.  I know a number of Members who have acted on behalf of customers with these agencies and they have come away in complete shock.  I am not easily shocked but when I saw the younger people coming on in Capita who were doing that work, it disturbed me that this would be going on in Irish society and our economy.

An individual had called on behalf of the bank to serve papers on her, and to say she was petrified would be an understatement.  I put her straight onto someone who is involved in this area to deal with the bank.  There is a problem, however, and the banks will have to change their mode of operation.  The banks have to realise that they cannot go back to dealing with individuals as they previously did.  That is one instance of a case which involved a mainstream bank.  <\/p><p> What is now happening is that the banks are reviewing a lot of cases.  While there may be a rule book and codes in place, I suspect that there is pressure on individuals at management level in banks to get loans in and people are cutting corners.  They are not taking into account individual circumstances, as was the case with this particular lady, who is doing everything in her power to pay her mortgage although she just could not pay the full amount.  I do not generally speak about these matters because they are private but this is an example of a mainstream bank dealing with a customer in a completely inappropriate way.  The bank was dealing with her as a back street moneylender or whatever one might want to call it would do.  A mob-style approach was adopted in dealing with this particular lady who lives on her own.  It was a dark winter's evening and what was done was highly inappropriate.  This needs to be fed back into the banks.  This is about the person at the top who dictates the type of attitude and regime of the institution.  I do not buy the theory about individuals.

One of the modules we intend to touch on will be on how banks and vulture funds are dealing with loans in the SME sector.  The financial ombudsman is prohibited from dealing with a case which involves an SME with a turnover of more than &euro;3 million.  In Europe, an SME is considered to be anything up to &euro;50 million.  Does the Minister intend to review that in light of the changing circumstances and the fact that so many SMEs have performing loans which have gone, for example, through the global restructuring group, GRG, with Ulster Bank and have been sold on to vulture funds?

When these loans are transferred to vulture funds, the loan is often then owned by, for example, Goldman Sachs or an organisation that is substantially bigger than the client with the loan.  These clients simply cannot compete on legal fees while at the same time running a business and answering unreasonable questions.  What are the Minister's views on the Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#FF00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>To date, all of the feedback and evidence I have seen points to the effective operation of the Act.  I imagine that the key provision the Chairman is pointing to in the Act is that which provides the protections available to the person associated with the loan are not changed if the owner of the loan changes, particularly if it moves from a bank to an entity that is not a bank.  It has not been flagged to me to date that the cap the Chairman referred to is an issue.  However, on foot of the Chairman raising it, my Department will now examine the matter.  I know that conversations that happen between customers and banks can be very difficult at times but we have expectations, and I, as Minister for Finance, have expectations, regarding standards that should be met when those discussions should be happening.  I am satisfied that the protection that is currently in place is robust but I will seek a report on the cap issue to which the Chairman referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#GG00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I am suggesting that the cap be changed because the Central Bank cannot deal with individual cases and the ombudsman is confined to dealing with cases where the amount involved is under &euro;3 million.  Where a business that is thriving and repaying its loans finds itself tied up with a vulture fund, there are often competing organisations in those vulture funds.  In other words, competitors may be owned by the same fund.  In order to protect themselves, their businesses and their employees, they have nowhere to turn to except the courts.  An SME is then fighting the likes of a giant vulture fund which has the money and the ability to chase them and make their lives miserable.  Therefore, instead of running the business, these SMEs are spending most of their time in the legal process and trying to sort out their affairs with a vulture fund.  It is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#GG00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I will meet the chairperson of the Credit Review Office tomorrow afternoon.  As the Chairman has been raising the matter, I have got a copy of the consumer protection code 2012.  The Chairman is correct that the definition includes persons or groups of persons and incorporated bodies with a turnover of less than &euro;3 million.  I imagine that what is driving this is that it is a consumer protection code as opposed to a protection code relating to businesses, for example.  I have not been advised of the kind of gap to which the Chairman refers but I will have a good opportunity to investigate the matter tomorrow afternoon.

Those involved are well able to have those conversations.  I am talking about the difference between a massive vulture fund that can almost treat the likes of those agencies here, in terms of the regulation of credit servicing, as puppets.  They just move them around.  Within their organisations, as they describe it, they have Chinese walls but there are competition issues within those vulture funds between the various properties that they have purchased.  There is an issue in that those who raised the loan in the first place cannot devote the type of time and money to getting their rights.  The law is weak in that area for the SME sector.  As I said, &euro;50 million is the limit applicable to SMEs in the European Union, yet it is &euro;3 million here.  If it is driven by something else, perhaps we should examine the need for the figure to be raised.  This is a major issue for companies and there is a huge danger in terms of employment.<\/p><p>In that context, will the Minister examine the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#GG00400","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I have said I will so I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#HH00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.
