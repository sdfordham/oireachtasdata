The Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, thanks the committee for the opportunity to review the Indecon report, provide an update and detail the ongoing development and progress of the industry.  The committee's confirmation of support for the harness racing industry and the IHRA has been noted.  Commenting on the Indecon report, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, recently stated, &quot;I acknowledge the potential of the harness racing sector and we have the basis on which to proceed.&quot;  It was acknowledged in the Seanad last December that this committee &quot;on an all-party basis, has been very supportive of the Irish Harness Racing Association's potential for several years&quot; and that &quot;The agriculture committee continues to support it on an all-party basis&quot;.  The IHRA is grateful for these comments.<br\/><br\/>Following the release of the Indecon report, and more so during the past six weeks, there has been discussion about harness racing going forward and the IHRA's current position on governance, potential and enthusiasm.  One word that has not been mentioned is &quot;expertise&quot;.  There has been talk of the IHRA needing to view things as a beginning, a first chapter and an opportunity to enter into a meaningful relationship.  However, what seems to be forgotten in these conversations is the fact that the IHRA venture in its current standing commenced more than four years ago.  Through business expertise, this venture has moved beyond a beginning, written several chapters on progress and development and forged meaningful relationships with key players both locally and internationally and, most importantly, with Government on an all-party basis.  Enthusiasm has been an important ingredient in driving this venture.  However, enthusiasm alone is of no value if there is not a level of expertise.  It is the IHRA's level of business expertise and acumen that has driven this venture to where we stand today, so much so that Indecon recognises that the IHRA is &quot;at a critical juncture&quot; with &quot;the potential to expand&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Today's presentation is important for all of us because it is the first formal opportunity the IHRA has had to bring everyone up to speed on the progress and development of the industry over a period that extends beyond the past 12 months.  It is now 12 months since the IHRA completed its engagement with Indecon and eight months since the report was delivered to the Department.  These past 12 months have seen major developments that will continue the ongoing progress toward a successful and vibrant harness racing industry.<br\/><br\/>Included in these major developments was the successful Pari Mutuel Urbain, PMU, meeting that took place in June 2017.  This was the first Irish harness race meeting to be broadcast and bet on in France, which is globally the largest harness racing market.  The meeting was conducted in Dundalk and its significance as a milestone cannot be overestimated not just for the sport, but also for Ireland.  Turnover in France on the four races amounted to &euro;750,000.  The feedback from the PMU and Le Trot was that this meeting performed well ahead of budget and received a better response than other racing normally held at that time of day.  Significantly, across all racing codes - thoroughbred, greyhound and harness - this meeting provided commissions higher than ever previously received for Ireland from tote wagering.  I ask the committee to keep this statistic in mind as this was only the first Irish harness meeting ever broadcast and wagered on in France.  In the context of the turnover that was achieved on this meeting, the Indecon report provides a key insight into the difficulty now being faced by the IHRA.  Indecon states:<\/p><blockquote>[T]here is potential for the harness racing sector to expand significantly and to enhance its economic contribution but we note there are significant barriers to development which the sector faces.  These include the absence of suitable track facilities to televise meetings and this is inhibiting the growth of the sector.  If the potential of the sector is to be realised there is a need for increased investment.<\/blockquote> <p>Indecon also notes, &quot;Unlike for thoroughbred racing, there is currently no contribution to prizemoney from the Irish Government.&quot;  One of the returns on investment Indecon notes for horse owners is linked to prize money.  Using its own initiative, the IHRA has delivered more than a threefold increase in the aggregate prize money on offer since 2013, or a cumulative 49% per annum growth for the past three years.  In 2017, total harness racing prize money amounted to &euro;685,000.  This year, the IHRA is budgeting industry turnover in the region of &euro;1 million.  In total, thoroughbred and greyhound racing received a budgetary appropriation of &euro;80 million, for which greyhound racing's portion was &euro;16 million.  I reiterate that the IHRA was able to achieve more international tote commission revenue from just one race meeting being broadcast internationally than the other two racing codes have generated.  This was achieved with no financial support from the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to the key points from the Indecon report, the first recommendation states, &quot;Responsibility for the operation of the Harness Racing industry in Ireland should be vested in the IHRA.&quot;  I am pleased to announce the operation of Irish Harness Racing is now centralised in the IHRA.  This means that all decisions regarding all aspects of the industry, including capital and other expenditure, are determined by the board of the IHRA, with all income accruing to the IHRA.  In addition, the operation and management of racetracks and races will move from the individual clubs to the IHRA.  Therefore, the first recommendation has been completed.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation states, &quot;Indecon are fully supportive of IHRA plans to enhance their corporate governance to align with best practice.&quot;  Regarding governance, Indecon stated:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he governance structures at the commencement of this review were not developed as yet to an adequate level to align with the best practice.  However, this is accepted by the IHRA and they have set out how they propose to restructure the industry and governance reflecting the growing scale of activity.<\/blockquote> <p>The key point to note here is that Indecon specifies &quot;at the commencement of this review&quot;, not at the end of or during it.<\/p><p>What is more Indecon said that the IHRA accepted this view and furthermore set out &quot;how they propose to restructure the industry and governance reflecting the growing scale of activity&quot;.  For the entirety of 2017, the IHRA set about addressing the matters of governance.  It can report that recommendations provided by Indecon for early implementation of IHRA plans to enhance its corporate governance to align with best practice have been progressively adopted over the past 12 months.  We can confirm that the following items identified within the report have been addressed: expanding the skills of the board, including the appointment of new independent directors; enhancing risk management and control, including establishing an order and risk committee; implementing and monitoring a risk register; establishing enhanced internal controls and checks; and ensuring the IHRA board operates in accordance with best practice governance and procedures.  Board size has increased, with greater levels of experience and expertise being identified and brought in, while board training has been ongoing.  Sub-committees are being established and have been put in place thereby enhancing internal controls and checks.  It is also important to note, as Indecon has done, that corporate governance for the IHRA is not something that is only beginning to be addressed with the release of this report.  Corporate governance has been going on for the IHRA over the past four years.  Abiding by practices of corporate governance has been a standard for IHRA through the entire journey.<br\/><br\/>This was a prerequisite when engaging in forging its relationship with Le Trot.  The IHRA is now entrusted with the oversight of hundreds of thousands of euros each year, managing prize money subsidies from France.  To be admitted to the Union of European Trotting, UET, the IHRA had to undergo vigorous audit requirements.  Upon successful completion of this audit, full membership was then granted.  The following point is also critical: for the IHRA to have its races broadcast and wagered on globally in many nations, integrity and governance need to be in place and at an international optimal level.  Indecon has not said that the IHRA is not fit for purpose in its current form.  It has recommended that responsibility for the operation of the harness racing industry in Ireland should be vested in the IHRA.  This has been achieved and &quot;Indecon are fully supportive of IHRA plans to enhance their corporate governance to align with best practice&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I would like to discuss other aspects of the Indecon report.  The report has proved to be a wonderful resource for the IHRA to measure progress and to identify what still needs to be done.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has highlighted: <\/p><blockquote>[The Department]... commissioned the report in good faith and we recognise the potential of the IHRA to become the kind of body with which we can engage in a structured way and into which we confidently invest taxpayers' money...  The Indecon report provides for that so we have that basis on which to proceed.<\/blockquote><p>It is for this reason that the IHRA has identified the delivery of the report to the Minister in May as a milestone in the four year journey and a matter of significance in the past 12 months pointing towards the exciting future of the industry.  The IHRA is now working toward addressing the five recommendations identified as within the report and accepts the position of the Minister when he says: &quot;Our only requirement is that the IHRA now deliver on the Indecon requirements.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 5 states: &quot;Indecon recommends that the pilot integration programme implemented should continue.&quot;  Indecon also states: &quot;To help address this issue [of road racing], the IHRA developed a horse appreciation and education programme which was given Government funding, and was run in 2016. The purpose of this initiative was to offer a horse and welfare education programme to those who are 'road-racing'.&quot;  The first pilot programme was very successful.  However, for the project to be sustainable over the long term appropriate facilities and infrastructure are necessary.  This was made abundantly clear when several graduates expressed their frustration in 2016 that after having successfully completed the course, there were no facilities available for them to continue and to reinforce what they had learned.  This meant they could not buy a horse as there were no training or stabling facilities available for use.  Importantly Indecon also makes this point: &quot;Effects [<i>sic<\/i>] should also be made to encourage past-programme participants to engage in the sport.&quot;  The IHRA wants a successful training programme to encourage people to be integrated into harness racing.  Unless the appropriate training and racetrack facilities are in place, this education and integration programme will fail to achieve its key objective and purpose.<br\/><br\/>The report also highlighted that the Government has previously supported several urban horse projects that involved in one case an allocation of &euro;2.25 million.  This was in contrast to the relatively low cost of the IHRA pilot programme of &euro;22,000, which was entrusted to the IHRA by the Department.  The Minister stated in December that &quot;As a signal of good faith, we are committing in the region of &euro;50,000 to the Irish Harness Racing Association for 2018 as a continuation and expansion of the pilot project&quot;.  This goodwill gesture by the Minister is appreciated, but more important is the question of whether it would assist in, or contribute to, resolving the road racing social issue.  It is the belief of the IHRA that equal to providing those funds is the execution of those moneys.<br\/><br\/>The IHRA knows that it is pointless handing over funds if they do not deliver on the targets being set here.  Unless there is a racing venue and training facilities the integration programme cannot succeed in being all that it needs to be.  The IHRA will identify the needs of this programme in its five year strategy document.  However, until these infrastructure matters for a post-integration programme are addressed, the IHRA does not want to use and in turn waste public money on a programme that cannot deliver the long-term benefits for which it was designed.  The IHRA looks forward to working with the Minister and his Department.  However, the only way there can be true public gain is by addressing this appropriately and thoroughly.  Within the recommendations Indecon concludes: &quot;The Harness Racing industry in Ireland is now at a critical juncture. Previous experience of other countries... [has] shown that there is the potential to expand, and an expansion may also be achievable in Ireland.&quot;  The IHRA knows that to prepare a comprehensive five year strategy plan requires certain processes to be undertaken.  These processes will take several months to complete before being ready for presentation.<br\/><br\/>At present, the IHRA is formulating a programme to ensure stakeholders, members and other interested parties are engaged in the consultation process.  The IHRA is keen to have all voices heard.  Included in the strategic plan process is the evaluation of racetrack development.  This will need to occur before State funding can be forthcoming.  The IHRA recognises and appreciates the requirements of this process.  However, it also notes this will inhibit its international market development and the integration programme.  The remaining recommendation from the Indecon report states:<\/p><blockquote>The Board of IHRA should identify a funding programme to support the expansion of the sector including the role of Exchequer seed funding for the sector. <br \/><br \/>THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME SEED FUNDING FOR THE SECTOR... <\/blockquote><p>The IHRA board is preparing a document that identifies the seed funding requirements to support the expansion of the sector.  This is a costed programme, as required by the Indecon report, identifying the areas of expenditure.  This will be prepared over the next weeks and will be available.  The IHRA accepts that this seed funding is provided on a pilot basis and its results will be evaluated before further funding, in other words, State funding is considered.  The key areas for the seed funding allocation are process costs for the preparation of the five-year strategy plan; legacy expenses incurred in preparation of the Indecon report; UET audit, governance and membership; Le Trot and France negotiations; international representation on committees; governance and governance training expenses; data development to an acceptable international level; and maintaining and enhancing the welfare and integrity of racing.  The Indecon report states that the IHRA does not currently have employees or significant resources.  At present, there is no confirmed amount for seed funding being requested nor is there an indication within the Indecon report that this seed funding is conditional on the IHRA delivering a five-year strategic plan.  They are two separate items within the Indecon report.<\/p><p> Recommendation 4 of the report makes the distinction between State and seed funding and, collectively, we all must do the same.<\/p><p> The IHRA achieved many milestones during the past four years.  We will continue to deliver during 2018 and we hope the Department, the Minister and the committee will continue to support us.  We hope a realistic amount of seed funding is appropriated to the IHRA in the coming month to ensure it can deliver to the Department and Minister the strategic plan that is necessary to ensure State funding is forthcoming.<\/p><p> Indecon has indicated that expansion of the sector is possible and that both seed and State funding should be considered.  This month two years ago, in 2016, the committee released its report.  On that occasion there was a recommendation that the IHRA receive appropriate funding to develop the sport of harness racing from an increased funding stream.  Today, we know the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department are on board, as are all parties.  The IHRA is ready to do the work to deliver.  As the Minister, Deputy Creed, has said, the Department has stated it has a fund and a document on which it can make progress.  Let us all make progress in 2018 and let us begin by providing the IHRA with an appropriate seed funding allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cooper for a very comprehensive analysis of the Indecon report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That was a very comprehensive presentation, as we are used to receiving from Mr. Cooper.

The IHRA has done things very well.  For a body starting up and in embryo stage, it has done things exceptionally well.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cooper spoke about the seed funding required by the IHRA.  He veered away from the major question, which is exactly how much money we are speaking about.  Mr. Cooper spoke about prize money.  How much prize money per race was given by the IHRA last year?  Mr. Cooper spoke about percentage and spoke about prize money increasing by 38%, but 38% of a small figure could still be a small amount of money.  How much prize money will the IHRA require if this is to be put on a proper footing?  We have a formula between Horse Racing Ireland and the Greyhound Board, which is 4:1 with regard to the distribution of Exchequer funding.  Horse Racing Ireland is of the strong view that an increase in betting tax could make this self-financing.  The IHRA probably has the same view, that if it could get its business up and running it could make it self-financing.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Cooper put flesh on what he is saying?  Committee members have met the witnesses on a number of occasions at this stage, and the IHRA has convinced us it is capable of doing the job.  It has convinced me that it is capable of doing it well.  The IHRA is at a crossroads now, as the &euro;50,000 that was provided is not enough to get it to the next stage.  How much money is required to get race meetings up and running properly and have tote pools which, in turn, will be self-financing and will allow harness racing to progress to the next stage with regard to providing its own circuit and race track?  Accommodation and the housing of ponies and horses is also essential for the business.  Mr. Cooper balked from stating the exact amount of money required to get the IHRA to the next stage.  It has done tremendously well and has convinced us it is doing everything by the book and correctly.  I am confident that everything is covered with regard to regulations and testing horses, and it is essential that this is done.  I would like more flesh on exactly what is needed to get the IHRA to the next stage.  It would be a shame, given all the work the IHRA has done, if it is left floundering.  If another 12 months goes by, it will be 12 months wasted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Similar to other committee members, I have been very impressed by the professionalism and enthusiasm of the IHRA in my interactions with it.  This is why it has had the all-party support of the committee for quite a number of years.  That commitment has probably strengthened over time.  The concern has been that the IHRA has also won the admiration and support of the international organisation and it receives substantial investment from other states but, unfortunately, this has not been matched by our own.  I hope this is about to change significantly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Indecon report, I will zoom in on its fourth recommendation and the issue of State seed funding.  It states State seed funding could be provided on a pilot basis and its impacts evaluated before any further funding is considered.  This is the key phrase, if we get to the nub of the issue.  Obviously, the &euro;50,000 for the integration programme will continue.  As Mr. Cooper stated, more than &euro;2 million has been invested by the State.  That is a separate issue.  It is very important because we had a very detailed exchange with the Minister.  I welcome the fact the Minister explicitly stated he supports what the IHRA is trying to do and he acknowledged his confidence in the organisation.  It appears to me from everything he said that he supports Indecon's recommendations.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that he appeared to state the IHRA needed to have a five year plan before it could get any funding outside the &euro;50,000 integration fund.  It is very important that the committee locks down this issue today.  To be very fair, I am conscious no profit is being made by the IHRA and it is purely about passion and professionalism.  We are taking liberties to expect the IHRA to keep doing this and certainly to expect it to implement the very reasonable recommendations, particularly in terms of safeguarding public investment.  We know there have been problems with regard to the funding received by other greyhound and horse racing organisations.  There have been corporate management issues and we do not want these repeated.  These are reasonable recommendations.  I welcome the fact the IHRA has totally embraced them, but there is only a certain amount it can do to implement them without seed funding.  It is critical that we deal with this today and that the committee continues to ask that the Minister-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00400","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is a phone or device causing interference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#K00500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I apologise.

It is comprehensive as usual.  I wish to consider the Indecon report and what has been done since.  There was a long period during which the report was not published.  However, notwithstanding it not being published, a fair amount was still known about what might be in it.  I refer in particular to the context of governance structures.  Has attention been paid to the recommendations pertaining to governance structures?  I refer especially to the appointment of additional non-executive directors.  Has the IHRA set about the establishment of the five sub-committees?  The various aspects of welfare and integrity and stakeholders are all very important, as is an audit and risk committee .  In terms of public moneys, as the IHRA will appreciate, it is important that all those elements are in place.  We have no doubt that the IHRA is deeply committed and very professional in its outlook.  We also have no doubt, from our interactions and representations even today, that the IHRA will ensure full compliance with all of the technical, health and safety, audit and risk and various other requirements associated with sport.  We have had other sporting participants where we have had to ensure that various legislation is amended to bring them up to speed.<\/p> <p>  The critical point, as noted by Senator Mac Lochlainn, is whether the IHRA is being coy about indicating what level of seed funding is required in the context of the recommendation of the Indecon report.  Can the IHRA say we need &euro;300,000 or &euro;500,000 or whatever it is?  It has been indicated that a certain level of seed funding would be forthcoming and that would be subject to evaluation to see how things are getting on.  While we may never be at the French level, in the context of our population, for the IHRA to take off, grow and develop, what is needed to attract bigger attendances?<\/p> <p>  How many races have taken place in 2017 in Ireland?  There were 11,000 or 12,000 in France but how many can we showcase to ensure that opportunities for expansion and growth are going to be available?  Prize money is a big issue and the witnesses have spoken of parimutuel betting and the potential income streams that arise from that.  Can that be explained in more detail?<\/p> <p>  Facilities for racing are important.  As the witnesses said, two years ago we were on a committee that made recommendations and probably opened the door slightly ajar for them to get through.  How are things going at that level in respect of racecourses?  Dundalk was important but is any other racecourse now becoming more amenable to the IHRA proposals?  In regard to the potential for television coverage, where does that fit in?  What level of income and media rights are associated with this particular sport?  Is it the equivalent of what is available at the Horse Racing Ireland level in terms of the ordinary courses across the country?  <\/p> <p>  A breeding programme has been initiated.  Could the potential numbers involved and the opportunity to expand significantly be outlined?  There is a diversionary programme, as I call it, for road racing, which is important.  It takes people off the roads and away from the dangers associated with that.  Some moneys have been invested in getting that up and running.  The crucial question for us is what level of investment is required to ensure that harness racing reaches its potential?  That is important.  The first step is establishing what level of seed funding is required.<\/p> <p>  Does the IHRA attract sponsorship for racing and if so, to what level?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#L00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Going back to Deputy Cahill's initial question about the percentage that we receive from the PMU, the international standard rate of 3% is what we receive.  That is basically what the figure is anywhere around the world when dealing with major totalisators.  Of that &euro;750,000 turnover achieved in France, we receive 3% in commissions on that.<\/p> <p>  With harness racing, there is probably more a propensity towards having a totalisator than towards fixed odds bookmakers.  That said, in Australia there is a move away from the totalisator towards more bookmakers.  We look towards bookmakers as being an opportunity.  I am in negotiations with a number of operators globally from a trotting perspective or from a harness racing perspective.  We are trying to come up with appropriate arrangements.  The longer-term aim with these deals being put in place at present is to incorporate Ireland in that.  That will be right across Europe.  When it comes to the PMU, which is the big one in the world, 3% is the turnover there.  <\/p> <p>  The governance side of things was mentioned.  A fair portion of what we are looking towards with regards to seed funding - we will come on to a figure on that in a moment - is on enhancing the whole governance side.  I will start on the sub-committees, which I think everyone has brought up thus far.  One key thing we need to do concerns the internal side of things.  We now have in place five sub-committees.  We have breeding, racecourse, integration, stakeholders and welfare and integrity sub-committees.  Three of those sub-committees will have open floor membership.  Members and stakeholders can apply to be part of those committees.  That includes the racecourse along with the stakeholders sub-committees.  They can apply to be on there and we want to have representation from our stakeholders on those committees.  <\/p> <p>  All committees will have a minimum of two IHRA board members.  The chairmen of each of those sub-committees will be an IHRA board member, so it will funnel up to the main IHRA board.  We have brought in independent directors to the audit and finance and risk sub-committee and they primarily make up that particular committee along with two members of the IHRA board.  That includes audit, finance and risk, so we are enhancing ourselves in that area.  <\/p> <p>  We consider the welfare and integrity committee to be probably equal with the audit and finance committee as the most important of the committees.  With that particular committee, we have brought in a number of experts from around Ireland.  We have veterinary surgeons, we have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>There are four independent people on that and three IHRA directors.

It wants to support us.  This support was in order to give us more meetings.  I will come onto that in just a moment.  With regard to the betting tax, of course we would also like to partake.  One of the issues which we have always faced, and on which we have always argued, is that the betting tax goes to the greyhounds and the thoroughbreds.  While it is not a huge amount, a portion of betting still takes place on harness racing here in Ireland and we do not see any of the tax on it.  We believe that we are entitled to some form of remuneration from that betting tax.  With the plans I have in place, and in negotiation with the various operators, I would like to think that we can increase the share of and entitlement to the betting tax for harness racing once we get the track and everything up and running.<\/p> <p>  Does that answer the committee's questions?  There was one other thing I was going to say on the governance side of things.  With the sub-committees now in place, and with things like the governance training and so on, we want to have a pyramid.  We have the board and then the sub-committees, which report up to it.  The board has already undergone training over the last 12 months.  We saw Indecon 12 months ago.  It outlined areas we needed to look at.  We have looked at them.  Board members have now had formal training.  We intend to give them more.  The board members have to fund all this training themselves in order to get themselves up to a certain level.  From there, we realised that the sub-committees were also in need of governance because they play very important parts and roles within their various disciplines and consequently, will also need corporate governance training.  The whole governance issue is very important and it is to the forefront of what we seek to enhance.  We believe that if we get the governance right then a lot of things will flow from there. <\/p> <p>  The bringing on of independent directors was a recommendation.  We brought them on six or eight months ago.  They are independent directors with expertise in specific areas including the areas of audit and finance, and governance.  That is the situation with regard to governance.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?<\/p> <p>  Moving on to Senator Mac Lochlainn, Mr. Flanagan just touched on the French matching funds, which are really important.  This year alone Le Trot will give &euro;192,000.  This amount has increased over recent years.  France has been very generous to us and supports us in a very big way through subsidised horses and prize money subsidies.  Instead of the stakeholders racing for &euro;500 or &euro;700, all of a sudden they are racing for &euro;2,000.  Therefore they are encouraged to get more horses.  What does that mean in turn?  Those horses have to be fed, they have to be shod and they have veterinary issues.  There is a flow-on effect within the economy from the money which France gives to us for that prize money subsidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>There were 370 horses raced in Ireland last year.

It questions us when we keep telling it that the Government is very supportive because it is not seeing anything in return for its support.  It wants us to succeed.  We will touch on the breeding in a moment but the French have put a lot of money in and are asking when they will get a return.<\/p> <p>  On the meeting with PMU, we have another meeting coming up in June of this year.  We are getting five races.  We are projecting more than &euro;1 million in turnover for that particular meeting.  We did not get any more meetings this year.  Looking at the history of how the French bodies have normally operated, we would have expected a couple of extra meetings this year.  We did not get any this year.  I suspect one of the reasons for that is that, having supported us this far, they are starting to question how much more support they must give before they get a return.  I anticipate that if this meeting goes well and if we progress in the next 12 months, we will get a couple more meetings next year.  Within the next five years we are aiming to have between 20 and 25 meetings a year.  These would include seven or eight races.  We would have turnover of between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million per race meeting from France on those 25 meetings.  All of a sudden we would be getting revenue of &euro;3 million.  It is not that far away.  We can achieve revenue of over &euro;3 million in commissions from France if the structures are in place and if France sees that we are prepared to assist it, because it has assisted us.  The matching of France's support is very important.  Other nations have also been very supportive.  Australia has supported us and was very generous in its comments in the Indecon report on what we have achieved so far.<\/p> <p>  Recommendations 4 and 5 were also mentioned.  They are two separate recommendations and, unfortunately, I think they have been melded together in previous conversations.  As Senator Mac Lochlainn rightly points out, the issues of seed funding and State funding are totally different.  The IHRA agrees with the Indecon report in that State funding can only come once we have prepared the strategic plan.  We accept that in the first instance but, as Indecon has stated, we should be entitled to some form of seed funding.  It now comes down to what we are doing to justify that seed funding.  We are in the process of putting that document together.  It is not far away from completion.  I will be distributing a copy to everybody before it goes out.  The five or six points I have mentioned will be spelt out within it.  Last year we were talking about &euro;770,000.  We are waiting for some final tenders to come back.  I cannot actually give a final figure but it will not come in at &euro;770,000.  However, we anticipate - and we will justify this - that we will probably be looking for between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 in seed funding to get us over the line and to deliver between now and August.  A lot of time and effort will be spent on the strategic plan this year.  We understand it is the most important thing.  <\/p> <p>  While we would love to have Portmarnock developed tomorrow if we could, we accept the process that needs to take place.  We recognise that it will not happen this year.  First we must have the strategic plan in place which, as I have said, will take a number of months to conclude.  That strategic plan will outline the proper development, what we want from a track and stabling facility, and the justification as to why it will cost a given sum of money.  That is what the full amount will be.  In the short term I anticipate that the seed funding will be between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000.  After that, we expect it will take a couple of million euro to develop the track and stabling.  <\/p> <p>  That then leads on to the training or integration programme.  If we go ahead and use the &euro;50,000 this year, it will end up like the situation two years ago.  Some of the graduates from that time are drivers now and some have a driver's licence.  All bar two graduates of that initial programme from two years ago came to a little lunch we held for them to celebrate up at Dundalk.  They said they really got a lot out of the programme and would like to race a horse but they had nowhere to stable or train.  Were the track to be developed I would be able to put it out internationally immediately, because there are a number of markets out there that would take us tomorrow.<\/p><p> After meeting several years ago, our interlocutors in Australia have said that if we held meetings there, and raced at certain times, they would put us on straight away.  There are markets that will take us.  It is not just a matter of having an international track.  We envision merging the two together with the integration programme.  It can constitute the use of State funding for two very important areas.<\/p><p> We want to get this programme up and running.  We want to do it around the country.  However, we do not want to waste public money if there is no follow-up.  As Indecon point out, there should be a follow-up programme.  If that is not in place, why go ahead and do it?  Let us get everything done correctly.  In the strategic plan we will devote a full section to the integration programme, the way believe it should operate and how it can benefit the country going forward.  We need to keep State funding and seed funding very separate.  We met with representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine just prior to the publication of the Indecon report.  Since then, we have been in regular communication with them via email.  With Christmas and new year over,  we will be meeting the Department tomorrow.  We will discuss what seed capital will be required and explain that we have now completed the report's first recommendation.  We are completing the second recommendation, but that will be an ongoing process.  We will discuss training, integration and our reasons for thinking that the sum of &euro;50,000 should not be spent at this point.  We will also explain how the strategic plan should come together and will be required of the Department<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose asked how many race meetings are held.

We want to develop this breeding industry so that in a decade it will be something of which Ireland can be very proud.<\/p> <p>  Dundalk Stadium was mentioned.  That concern has been very generous to us.  It is the only racetrack in Ireland that we are using, apart from Portmarnock Raceway and some locations in the North.  We also race on grass.  We use Dundalk Stadium for the LeTrot PMU premium meeting.  Hopefully they will be kind enough to come to some arrangement with us.  I do not want to go into financial details here, but that commission is very nice, with a 3% headline on that turnover of &euro;750,000.  However, there is significant expense in using a third-party racetrack for which payment is required.  If we had our own track we would not have to pay rent.  The cost-benefit breakdown of renting is one of the reasons we did not push as hard as we could have for conditional PMU meetings.  Dundalk is a great site and looks very well on television.  When I was in Paris last year I watched the meeting, and both Dundalk and Ireland came across very well.  They put together a very good programme.  I would award full marks to Dundalk Stadium.

We have met many times, and to cut to the nub of it, I am a firm believer in priming the pump.  If we want any industry to start and to function, we have to invest in it during the initial stages and get it to the stage where it can continue on its own, hopefully generating a return.  That must happen with this industry.<\/p> <p>  As well as meeting with our witnesses, I have looked into what happens in France and other countries.  I am aware of how large this industry is, how much money it makes and how well it is doing.  I agree that there seems to be real potential here.  This sport has an added social value in that it takes these people off the roads.  It reduces the anti-social element which many people associate with harness racing.  That can be turned on its head, creating something very positive.  Huge kudos would result from the Government investing money for that return.  Over time that investment will come back in spades. <\/p> <p>  I give full credit to the witnesses for the work they have done.  The five recommendations of the Indecon report are very clear.  The witnesses appear to have gone a long way towards fulfilling the parts of those recommendations which fall to them, even if, considering the circumstances, they have not gone all the way.  The remaining requirements concern the seed funding.  State funding is vital.  In 2016 Sport Ireland invested in a range of organisations.  Basketball Ireland received &euro;588,000 that year, while Cricket Ireland received &euro;355,000.  A total of &euro;10 million was awarded to a range of very small, niche sports across the country.  Harness racing is something which can generate a return and can be developed into an industry which would contribute to the economy.  Many of these sports will not do that.  That does not mean they are not worthy.  They are clearly very worthy of every penny they get.  However, this would allow the Government to invest in order to create something which will give something back.  The work the witnesses have done is very worthwhile, and I think all the members of the committee that have heard this presentation, and those who have met with the witnesses separately, would agree.<\/p><p>All the people on the committee have heard the witnesses and met them outside of this meeting and they would feel we can, as a committee, recommend to the Minister and the Department that the &euro;500,000 - rather than the &euro;400,000 - that the witnesses say they need right now would be money well spent.  It would be a proper investment.  Further down the road there is talk of needing much larger sums and we would have to look at that when the time comes.  It would be worth doing that if we can see this is about establishing something and specifically an industry that would create a return.<\/p><p>I have been quite critical in the past of many industries and groupings in the country getting large amounts of money every year who seem to be doing very well but continue to need State funding.  It is important to state at the beginning that there must be a stage when the State must pull back from groups of this nature.  We need to say that these guys have been propped up and kept going for so long and there comes a time when the State must pull back a little and say we cannot continue it forever.  Those groups must find their way in developing an industry that would pay for itself.<\/p><p> Looking at international examples and as far as I can see, harness racing has the potential to become self-sustainable but it will not do so unless we invest in it initially.  I fully endorse the comments of the witnesses and the plan put forward.  I assume the five-year plan would be fully costed and it would set out a stage-by-stage process outlining how this would become sustainable.  The committee should recommend to the Minister and the Department that the seed funding of &euro;500,000 should be found in order to bring us to the next stage.  We should have confidence to do that as a committee at this point.  I wish the witnesses all the best and I hope the money will be spent very wisely.  I hope not too many people will get a big salary or attend junkets.  I am sure that would not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#N00800","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516116600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I know this matter has been discussed well by previous speakers and in the responses to the questions.

We do not have the capacity at committee level to allocate funding but it is crucial to see a pathway that can be developed quickly being established between the association and the Department so as to ensure ongoing engagement and bring us to the stage where the seed funding can be promptly delivered.

This would be an investment for the industry's future.  The strategic plan will be fully costed and it will include the cost of redeveloping Portmarnock or a new track.  That is what we are working towards.

If we can do it around the country in a progressive fashion and there is an ability to get horses, training programmes and a training track under the one umbrella, in the long term it will succeed.  We have always argued that Europe does not have this problem because there is an established trotting industry, with an amateur driver side of things.  There are equivalent operations in France, for example, who can race at meetings.  From a longer-term perspective, we can make a difference, although this will not happen overnight.  The return on investment will very much be part of that strategic plan.  With the seed funding document we will list what we are looking for and where the economic benefits on that side will be included.  As we have noted, we believe there is a massive opportunity for this country on the breeding side.<\/p> <p>  How big can harness racing be for Ireland?  One must remember that on mainland Europe, this is the number one horse racing sport.  It is bigger than racing thoroughbreds.  Even if we just steadily increase the numbers, from a breeding perspective we could become the supplier to Europe in the long term.  That is where we see a big opportunity.  From a racing perspective, we would love to say we could be self-sustaining as quickly as possible but that will only come about when we have international meetings and domestic betting.<\/p><p> We were lucky enough a couple of years ago to have Satellite Information Services, SIS, in the UK cover our meetings and bookmakers were given an opportunity in that context.  I look at schedules around the world to identify where there is an opportunity.  Last year, one country said it needed trotting at certain times of the day and asked if we could supply it.  I am looking for opportunities to sell our product and get our 3% back on that turnover so that we can be as self-sustaining as possible once the initial investment in the industry has been made.  The development of the racing side and the international and integration programme can come together with the overall investment from the State.  The long-term strategic plan will spell that out.  The Indecon report is very clear in its statement on seed funding to the effect that the latter should be totally separate from State funding and that we should be entitled to it.<\/p><p> I like to think that we have developed a very good relationship with the Department over the three or four years we have been visiting it.  There are some very understanding staff there who get what the horse racing industry involves and we have had some good conversations with them.  The last time we were in there was a few days before the Indecon report came out.  We did not realise it was coming out so soon.  We had a very open discussion about the funding that is needed.  This was followed by the Indecon report coming out.  Then there was the 21 November session, then the debate in the Seanad and then it was Christmas.  We wanted to see officials from the Department in December but the timetables did not work out.  The Department suggested early January when we were next over.  I said we would be coming to this meeting and the Department suggested we get together after this session.  We will be meeting the Department's representatives tomorrow.  We hope a roadmap will be put forward of what it needs in order for us to be able to move forward and go through the five recommendations.  It is not just a question of horse racing.  Animal welfare must also be considered and we have met the relevant officials.  They are the ones we approached about the integration programme.  I have been in contact with them this year on how to move forward with that.  We hope the Department's door is open so that we can meet on a monthly or bimonthly basis and update it on our progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018011600002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Arthur Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516116600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Over the past three years, the stakeholders of the IHRA have invested up to &euro;1 million in horses to get us to this point.

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Anna Donegan, Mr. John Palmer, Mr. Kevin Nolan and Mr. Faris Bader, who are all from the Department of Finance.  My understanding is that the committee wishes to discuss the revaluation of properties for the purposes of the local property tax, LPT, and the yield from the increase in stamp duty on non-residential property.  My statement will address each of these in turn. <\/p> <p>  The LPT is an annually recurring tax applying to most residential properties owned on a specific liability date.  The tax is currently linked to the market value of the property as at 1 May 2013.  The legislative basis for LPT is the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended.  The Revenue Commissioners have operational responsibility for the administration of the LPT and the tax has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners since it commenced.  This continues to be the case.  Between 2014 and the end of last year, Revenue remitted LPT to the Exchequer and an equivalent amount was paid over to the local government fund by the Minister for Finance for onward distribution to the 31 local authorities by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As of the start of this year, the Revenue Commissioners are remitting LPT directly to the local government fund under reforms provided for the Water Services Act 2017.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has responsibility for LPT allocations to local authorities from the local government fund. <\/p> <p>  The local property tax has broadened the domestic tax base and provided a new source of revenue for local authorities to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.  Our reliance in the past on transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable foundation for Government revenue.  In contrast, the experience internationally has been that property taxes provide a stable and secure source of funding.  The LPT is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities, although both yields and rates are modest by international standards.  The charging structure for LPT is progressive.  The basic rate of 0.18% applies up to property values of &euro;1 million with a higher rate of 0.25% applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold.  At the end of 2017 and since its inception, LPT has contributed over &euro;2 billion to the funding of local authorities. <\/p> <p>  From 1 January 2015, elected members of local authorities have had discretion to vary the LPT rates by plus or minus 15%.  If a local authority decides to reduce the LPT rate, it forgoes the equivalent amount of the reduced LPT yield from its allocation.  If a local authority votes to increase the LPT rate above the basic rate, it receives the full amount of the increased yield.  We understand that seven local authorities voted to increase their LPT above the basic rate in 2018 and that four have decided on a reduced rate. <\/p> <p>  The introduction of the LPT in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State, with over 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file LPT returns and pay the tax in respect of around 1.9 million properties.  The first valuation date was 1 May 2013.  The valuations declared for that date determined tax liabilities for 2013 - a half year - 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes to November 2019.  The postponement to November 2019 of the revaluation date for LPT means that homeowners were not be faced with significant increases in their LPT for 2017, 2018 and 2019 as a result of increased property values. <\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners publish comprehensive LPT statistics on a quarterly and annual basis, which include information in relation to collection and compliance, exemptions and deferrals, and payment types.  Some of this is broken down by local authority.  The compliance rate for 2017 is currently 97%, which is line with rates in previous years. <\/p> <p>  Given its importance and conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and potential effects on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the previous Minister for Finance engaged Dr. Don Thornhill in 2015 to conduct a review of the operation of the LPT.  The review focussed in particular on any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments.  The terms of reference for the 2015 review required that it also have regard to the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue on an ongoing basis and the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.<\/p> <p>  The central recommendation of Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s 2015 review was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance is now advancing consideration of issues relating to the implementation of the remaining recommendations in the 2015 Thornhill LPT review report in line with the 2019 revaluation timeline.  We welcome the opportunity to hear the views of committee members in relation to LPT and we look forward to the report of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations which will inform our own work.  Following the completion of the Department&rsquo;s work, recommendations will be put to the Minister for Finance who intends to make the future position on LPT clear so that households will know well advance of November 2019 what the Government&rsquo;s plans are for the LPT.   It is important to note that the Minister for Finance has reiterated the importance of the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT, that is, achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer term.  This principle will inform our current consideration of this matter.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2018 included a change to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, which was projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 included a change to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, which was projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.  This was based on estimates in Revenue&rsquo;s pre-budget ready reckoner, which showed the effect of a 0.5% increase in the rate on non-residential property to be a &euro;47 million increase in yield &ndash; this is multiplied up to &euro;94 million for a 1% increase or &euro;376 million for a 4% increase.<\/p><p> We understand from Revenue that the yield projection for 2018 was based on receipts for previous years, combined with an ongoing assessment of expected receipts by the end of 2017 and for 2018, as well as impacts of earlier policy changes.  This process includes assessment of significant once-off transactions that positively increased 2016 receipts but which were not expected to recur on a regular basis.  Failure to account for these one-off transactions would have led to a higher estimate for 2018.  The estimate is therefore considered to be conservative and prudent.<\/p><p> Following budget 2018, Revenue updated the ready reckoner to a post-budget basis, taking account of budgetary changes and revised growth forecasts from the Department for 2018. The post-budget ready reckoner indicates that each 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;49 million increase in the overall yield.  This would indicate that the estimated additional yield from the increase in stamp duty rate on non-residential property could be in the region of &euro;392 million rather than &euro;376 million.  In the absence of precise and accurate forecasts for transaction volumes in 2018, basing receipts on 2016-17 levels and trends is the most reasonable option.  The estimate also assumes current exemptions and other reliefs remain unchanged.<\/p><p> We are advised by Revenue that, adjusting for possible one-off transactions in 2016, receipts in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 were quite stable and Revenue's assessment is that it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue.<\/p><p> Tax receipts under all heads are monitored closely and reported on in the monthly fiscal monitor, which incorporates the Exchequer statement.<\/p><p> As regards the economic rationale perspective, there were three primary reasons for the increase in the rate.  Investment in non-housing building and construction has expanded rapidly over recent years and is approaching its pre-crisis share of GNI.  The Department&rsquo;s forecasts suggest that this category of building investment will amount to some 8.1% of GNI in 2017, increasing to 10% by 2021.  These forecasts are well in excess of the long-term average of 7.1%.  The forecasts suggest that if left unchecked and combined with the need to significantly increase the level of residential construction there is a risk of overheating in the sector.<\/p><p> The need for increased housing supply is acute.  To ensure that the building and construction sector is able to meet this demand while avoiding overheating in the sector as a whole, policy measures that would incentivise a re-balancing of activity away from non-residential commercial construction activity in favour of residential activity are needed.  I would like to note that our position on this matter has been supported by a number of economic commentators.<\/p><p> The flat rate of 2% was introduced at a time when activity levels were exceptionally low.  It was intended to incentivise activity and was justified by the exceptionally difficult market situation and lack of commercial output that applied at the time of its introduction.  Activity in the sector has now fully recovered, negating the need for the continuation of such a measure.<\/p><p> I hope the foregoing will be of assistance to the committee.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hogan.

I very much welcome this discussion, which is a good example of the work this committee can do.<\/p> <p>  I asked the Taoiseach earlier today about the Government's approach on this issue.  Perhaps the officials could inform me further in that regard.  The Taoiseach informed me that the Minister for Finance was to today launch a proposal or reflect on a paper that went to Cabinet today.  In the absence of the Minister, perhaps the officials could give members some indication of what that involves.  I very much see this as an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas on which I want to focus is the possibility of a switch from the current model of local property tax towards a site value form of property tax, which I believe would bring a variety of benefits to the country.  Is that being considered as part of the review that is taking place?  I will briefly outline why it makes sense.  Central to the national planning framework is the conviction that we have to start bringing development back to the centre of our communities, make efficient use of our land and stop the ongoing sprawl of cities in our country which has huge cost to the State in terms of transport, health, education and other services.<\/p> <p>  One of the main benefits of a site value tax is it gives a great kick towards more sustainable, concentrated development.  Second, in the absence of any other measures to get back the value that the State often applies in terms of the building of infrastructure and so on, it provides a mechanism whereby that value would not necessarily accrue to the private landowner but, rather, would be a public value, which could come from rezoning, investment in the public transport system or the building of a school, that would have a real effect in terms of increasing property and land values.  A site value tax would be a very effective way of capturing some of that value.  It is a method used in Denmark, Australia, parts of America and other locations.  We are not looking for something untested or out of the ordinary.  In my experience, it has always been opposed by the Department of Finance because of the belief that we do not know who owns what land.<\/p> <p>  In 2009, the tax commission set out some of those difficulties, as well as difficulties in terms of how to assess the site value.  However, my understanding is that in the interim we have built up a better register of land ownership and there are new mechanisms involving computerised data and indexes of property transactions.  The work done by Ronan Lyons in Trinity College Dublin shows that there are ways in which such valuation schemes could be introduced at low cost.  There is a gain to the State in terms of the incentive towards a better form of housing development and also a better form of local government revenue.  I would like site value tax to apply to commercial land as well as residential land, thus replacing the rates system.  It would bring huge benefits.  It is not an issue of Dublin versus the rest of the country.  The level of tax would not necessarily vary, although research would be needed in terms of what people in Dublin would pay compared to those elsewhere in the country.  However it would begin stopping the unsustainable use of land in our country by putting absolutely valid and correct constraints on landowners.  I am very interested to know whether the witnesses or other departmental officials are considering that as part of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#D00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan for his comments.  As regards his first point on what he discussed earlier today with the Taoiseach, the Minister has this afternoon issued a press release announcing a review of the local property tax, LPT.  Today he briefed his Government colleagues on the approach the Department will be advancing during 2018.  The review will include a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of LPT.  It will start in February and will, in particular, consider the impact on LPT liabilities of properly priced developments.  It will include an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill report and will be conducted by a cross-departmental group chaired by this Department and comprising officials from Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is expected that it will be completed by the end of August and the group will provide several policy options for consideration by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the review will be to inform the Minister of any actions he may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue.  As I said in my opening address, the review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability over the short and longer terms on LPT payments of liable persons.  It will kick off in February and move on from there.<\/p> <p>  As regards the issue of site value tax, Deputy Ryan can appreciate that it was considered at some length in the original Thornhill report of 2012, which considered the issue of the market value tax that was ultimately opted for versus site value tax and the options and opportunities in that regard.  It was concluded that site value tax did not stand up to the rigorous scrutiny across several parameters or indicators by which a property tax would be introduced in the same manner that market value tax did.  The Deputy is correct that along with the Thornhill report there were previous explorations of the potential for a property tax by both commissions of taxation that looked at the approach and rejected the idea of a site value tax.

The tax commission believed that there was real economic rationale behind a site value tax but that administrative difficulties would arise.  In 2012, it feared that the real concentration was on the immediate task of getting a very quick revenue boost for the State, which was in significant financial difficulty.  Is there not a case, on the basis of what the national planning framework says we want to do, to say that we should use tax as a signal in the context of ensuring better development and use of land?  A site value tax, in my mind, would do that.  I cannot think of a better way to do that, for both commercial and residential land.  In one fell swoop, it would provide massive a stimulus towards sustainable development, which is essential for a properly working economy.<\/p> <p>  Listening to the radio this morning, I heard that construction is not happening in the centre of Dublin.  Some companies are leaving the city because we do not have the correct signals in terms of use of our land so that accommodation can be provided in the places that people want it.  A site value tax provides that.  I recognise that there are administrative difficulties.  Ten years ago, people said that we should do it but that it would take time and would not provide immediate revenue.  We now have a certain amount of time and we are in a different fiscal position.  I am of the view that it should be reconsidered in that light and in the context of the housing crisis, which, to my mind, has been caused by the inappropriate tax signals we have.  Yesterday, I met a lady in the caf&eacute; upstairs in this building.  It took her three hours to get from Edenderry to Dublin yesterday.  I am sure it took her three hours to get home in the evening.  We have chaotic transport and land use systems.  This is a chance to start getting it right.  Why should that be ruled out?  The only reason pointed to any of these reports is administrative difficulties, which is not a good enough reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#E00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that in the context of Thornhill's original assessment of the site value tax there were certainly some merits from an efficiency perspective.

I am against the property tax.  I never saw the rationale for it.  I am of the view that it is a regressive tax.  I do not expect the witness to agree with me on that.<\/p> <p>  For the record, facts are important.  At the time the property tax was first introduced, there were a number of justifications for it.  I have not checked the records, but I am fairly sure it was the case that those introducing it - presumably advised by the Department of Finance - suggested that a property tax would help quell the property market and prevent some of the excesses we saw in the period leading up to the crash in 2008.  Can the witness remind us if the Department of Finance actually advised the Government at the time that it would have this impact?  I certainly remember that as being one of the arguments that was used.<\/p> <p>  My primary concern is for the future.  There is absolutely no doubt that with a 71% increase in property values since 2013 that we are talking about frightening increases in property tax for huge numbers of people.  Has the Department carried out an assessment in terms of the regressive impact on those who cannot afford it?  That is one of the primary reasons we opposed it.  Has the Department carried out an analysis of the potential regressive impact of dramatic increases in property tax?  If I read the paper correctly, 46,000 households have already sought deferrals on the basis that their income is below the threshold.  People cannot afford to pay.  How many more households would find themselves unable to pay if there was a 71% increase.  In order to inform any meaningful discussion on this matter, we need to know that.  How many people are going to be impoverished by this because they will simply not be able to pay?  If that analysis has not been carried out the Department is not really serious about scrutinising the potential impact of this.<\/p> <p>  Does the witness know how much is owed by those who have sought deferrals on the basis that their income is not adequate to pay the tax?  How much debt liability is being built up by those who cannot afford to pay this regressive tax as a consequence of deferrals?  Is there any plan in the review of the tax to discuss the issue of ability to pay?  I do not find these discussions about site value and property very interesting, because for me the issue is whether people can pay the tax or not.  It is already clear that huge numbers of people cannot.  Dublin is full of these people, as are the other urban centres.  They are pensioners with miserable pensions, people on social welfare or those with very low incomes who happen to live in properties that have high values.  The values of those properties are going through the roof, and the tax that will be levied against them, which is bad now and may be worse in the future, bears no relationship whatsoever with their ability to pay.  Has any analysis of this been done?  Specifically, can the witness give us figures about how much is owed by that group of people who could not afford to pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#E00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, I believe that the rationale and reasons for introducing the property tax were manyfold.

My questions are in no particular order.  I represent a Dublin constituency and as the witnesses are aware, there is a feeling in urban areas that they are disproportionately affected by property tax and how it is levied.  From the figures provided in the table by the Revenue Commissioners today, I note the yield from Dublin city in 2016 was close to &euro;17 million, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown it was close to &euro;45 million and in Fingal, it was just over &euro;30 million.  In my own area of South Dublin County Council, it was &euro;26.5 million.  As Dublin local authorities accounted for 40% of the overall local property tax take, it would be catastrophic if properties were revalued given that, according the figures cited today, values in Dublin have increased by more than 80% since 2012 and 2013, while nationally figures have gone up by 71%.  I am taken by the fact that Revenue needs certain information quite quickly in terms of planning.  During the meeting of 12 December, Revenue officials stated that no analysis has been carried out on the impact of property price increases since 2013 on local property tax liabilities and yield if a re-evaluation were to be carried out.  No work has been done there.  Given that policy decisions will need to be taken in 2018, does the Department intend to carry out such an analysis?<\/p><p>The Chairman and anyone who is a local authority member will appreciate my next question.  We have talked about yield, values, and how the local property tax, LPT, is a consistent revenue yield for local authorities.  That is true in part but any increase in the income they got and are getting from the LPT was offset by a reduction in grants coming from the Department of the environment.  There was no significant net yield and this comes to the heart of the matter.  One argument put forward by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, around the time of the introduction of the local property tax was that it would lead to a significant increase in services provided by local authorities.  From my own experience of 17 years as a county councillor, I cannot testify to any<i><\/i>significant increase in revenue leading to additional local government services being provided.  The local property tax allowed for a reduction by each local authority of up to 15%.  No figures have been provided, however, and we could do with the figures on what local authorities have done in that regard over the past four or five years.  For instance, how many have reduced it year on year?<\/p><p>While South Dublin County Council reduced it every year by 15%, to my knowledge only a small number of local authorities reduced it by less than 15%.  I do not know if any local authority increased it.  I, therefore, would love to see an analysis of the exercise of the ability to increase or decrease it by 15% because very few councillors throughout the country will vote for an increase in a local tax, regardless of how it is packaged.  When I was a local councillor, each year the chief executive presented to local councillors what the council could get in if the local property tax was increased by 15%.  If the officials do not have to hand an analysis of this ability to increase or decrease the tax by 15%, perhaps they could provide it over the next few weeks.  How effective has it been or have councils and public representatives essentially felt paralysed in the face of it?  The Minister announced a review today but there seem to be mixed signals coming from the Government about this, or there were until today.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government spoke about a radical overhaul and seemed to imply that any new local property tax system would not be based on property value but on a range of other issues.<\/p><p>Another Deputy mentioned the next issue which is very close to my heart.  Both the Chairman and I represent the same area and he knows the types of estates about which I am speaking.  Older people who are reliant on the State pension are living beside someone in a terraced or a semi-detached house that is worth exactly the same, but the State pensioner is utterly reliant on the State pension while the person next door could have a significant salary, yet they are both paying the exact same property tax.  The ability of an individual to pay was never recognised and this needs to be fed into the system.  This is testified to by the amount of people struggling with it.<\/p><p>The figures for collection are testimony to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are the best sheriff in the west.  However, some counties are falling a little behind.  The Dublin counties are 98% or 99% compliant.  Those figures are very high.  The same applies to some other counties.  When we consider other urban areas such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford cities, well over 50% of the local property tax is being contributed by the urban areas.  The officials might explain why some counties are 95% compliant rather than 98% or 99%.  Are there data on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#F00600","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The Deputy might forgive me if I respond to his observations in no particular order.

I presume this is to ensure compliance rates do not decrease with increases in the amounts being charged or a variation of bands.  It comes back to a political decision for the Minister over how much revenue he wants to raise.  Does Mr. Hogan agree that a decision on how much we want to raise would provide the starting point for an interdepartmental working group, and that we would then look at how we could achieve it?  The briefing document of the Parliamentary Budget Office considers a number of options, one of which was revaluing and adjusting rates locally to maintain the current LPT yield.

However, we are fairly clear that we had quite a bit of interaction with Revenue throughout the summer, on stamp duty and on other measures that could have been taken as part of budget 2018.  That is part of the natural discourse that we have with Revenue as we build our information resource to help the Minister make budgetary decisions.  <\/p> <p>  The pre-budget ready reckoner produced by Revenue was available from mid-July onwards.  That gave an indicative number of &euro;94 million raised per 1% increase.  Often when we look at policy options to put to the Minister the background to a number such as that will be part of our dialogue with Revenue.  More generally, we discuss whether there is some scope for increasing or reducing a figure because of the potential impact of that on yield and the available fiscal space. <\/p> <p>  Throughout our discussions of the Finance Bill, there was quite a lot of interaction between the Department and our Revenue colleagues.  We discussed the change to commercial stamp duty and the associated legislative provisions that were needed to give effect in the budget to that decision by the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The representative from the Revenue stated that to the best of his recollection, there was no consultation with the Department on this measure.

I was interested in Mr. Hogan's opening statement.

He makes the point in his opening statement that \"We are advised by Revenue that, adjusting for possible one-off transactions in 2016, receipts in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 were quite stable and Revenue's assessment is that it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue.\"  How long does the Department expect the &euro;9 billion of commercial property transactions to continue?

Even the commentary from the industry over the Christmas period and into the early part of the new year has been quite upbeat in terms of the plans for further development in the sector over the next number of years.  Having regard to all of those factors, our expectation is that Revenue's approach to this has been based on solid analysis and will help us fulfil our target for stamp duty for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#K02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516118400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will revert to the question.  How long does the Department expect it to continue?  Mr. Hogan's statement says \"it seems reasonable to expect this level of activity is sustainable and for it to continue\".  How long is it expected to continue?  Is it that we will get over 2018, we will have &euro;9 billion of property transactions, we will meet the target and it will then drop back to what it was prior to the three years which Revenue is using to calculate it?  In 2013 the level of commercial property transactions was half what is was in 2014.  Then 2014, 2015 and 2016 remained stable, when one-offs were stripped out.  I am not sure of the final figures for 2017.  How long does the Department expect that trend to continue?<\/p> <p>  It has been stated to be sustainable and for it to continue.  In the Department's view, which I am sure accepts Revenue's view, how long do we expect this?  The reason I ask is that while it will be okay if we hit the figure this year, if there is a drop off - as there was in 2013 - then half the base is gone.  It is quite interesting because, in the last conversation about the local property tax, one of the big arguing points the former Minister for Finance had at that time was about commercial stamp duty and over-reliance on it.  In his opening statement one of his major gambits was that we needed a more stable base rather than relying on 9% commercial stamp duty.  It is quite interesting that these two subjects are sandwiched together.  How long does the Department of Finance expect us to have &euro;9 billion of commercial property transactions annually?  That is the figure that needs to continue to be achieved to be able to bring in the type of revenue that is suggested would come in annually from this increase.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#K02600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I do not think we have a precise timeframe as to how long we expect this to continue.

If it is, I am a little worried because I believe there is overheating in the commercial sector.  This increase in stamp duty is not about tax increases, rather it is about trying to slow down what is happening in this sector.  If what is happening remains constant, then this measure is not having the desired impact.  This is not just about the buildings or offices being constructed but the sharp increase in value in commercial property, which was at the core of our banking crisis.  For that reason, this is important.  Does the Department of Finance expect that level of activity to continue beyond 2018 to 2019 and 2020 and, if so, how does that sit alongside the concerns identified in the tax strategy papers the year before last regarding the need to view this as a policy option to try to cool down what is happening, particularly in the Dublin area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018011600002#L00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516118400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The considerations of the Department are informed by the projections given to it by the Revenue Commissioners and the views of the economics team within the Department on how the commercial property market is unfolding.

I am looking to present the Ombudsman for Children's office annual report for 2016.  We were due to present this information in December of last year but, due to timing issues, our appearance was postponed.  Therefore, we are very pleased with the opportunity to appear today, and I thank the committee for its rapid rescheduling of same.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Ombudsman for Children's office is an independent human rights institution established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  My office has a unique combination of statutory functions.  We examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children and, under section 7 of the Act, we promote and monitor the rights and welfare of children and young people in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our annual report, which was published in May 2017, lays out the main work of the office during 2016.  It shows another increase in the number of complaints received by the office and outlines the work we have done in raising awareness of children's rights through our rights education programme, the advice offered on upcoming legislation and other policy work.  I know all members have had access to our annual report but I will briefly mention a few of the key statistics from it.  In 2016 we received 1,682 new complaints, which is an increase of 3% on 2015 and a 47% jump since 2010.  Of those who contacted us, 78% were parents and, as has been the case for many years, education was the most complained about issue, covering 46% of our complaints.  Child protection and welfare accounted for 23% of the complaints, which represented a slight drop on the previous year.  Health complaints were up to 17% from 14%, and another area where we noted an increase was in housing and planning complaints, where there was an increase from 3% in 2015 to 5% in 2016.  The majority of people who contacted us came from the main urban centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 we interacted with more than 4,000 children and young people, many of whom took part in rights education workshops in our office, while we met others at events and seminars all over the country.  We advised on a range of legislation and policy in 2016, including the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as well as the consultation on the age of digital consent.  We also carried out a wide-ranging consultation with young people called Tune In, in which more than 2,000 young people responded to our questions about how they communicate and how they would like to receive information on their rights.<\/p> <p>  Having read our annual report, members will note that we have highlighted a number of key issues using case studies of complaints made to our office on behalf of children.  In the case of Ciara, a young girl in need of a hip scan, we found that the process of faxing referrals was resulting in errors and subsequent delays in diagnosis.<\/p><p>We asked the HSE to analyse all similar cases, and in the 2,000 it analysed it found the same problem had affected 20 other infants.  In this case, the HSE then put out a national order to stop faxing and introduced a new system.  This is an excellent example of how making a single complaint can improve a system for other children and their families.<\/p><p> Other case studies outlined in the report highlight the continuing struggle faced by children with disabilities and their families.  Children with disabilities continue to face barriers in trying to access services and live a normal life.  Committee members may have noted that yesterday we published an investigation involving a young girl, whom we have called Molly.  She is 14 and has Down's syndrome and severe autism.  She was abandoned at birth and has been in foster care since she was four months old.  We investigated the complaint made by Molly's foster mother about the level of support and services provided to Molly by the HSE and Tusla considering her disability.  This case is important not only for Molly, but for the 471 other children with severe and moderate disabilities who are in State care and who need additional supports.  This case, like those included in our annual report, highlights the need for increased and improved interagency co-operation to ensure the rights of children with disabilities are fully realised in Ireland.  It is also important to mention the urgent need to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to promote the rights of these young people.<\/p><p> Homelessness affecting all children is an issue that is not going away.  More than 3,300 children and young people in Ireland are homeless, trying to live a normal life while eating their dinner on their knees, sharing a single room with their family and having no space of their own.  I have been clear in outlining my concerns about the issue of homelessness and how it affects children and young people.  I do not believe the measures in place to tackle homelessness have fully addressed the disproportionate and long-term impact homelessness has on children.  I have met the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, but still remained concerned about how children and families will be helped out of this nightmare and how long it might take.  I appreciate that family hubs are being rolled out to address the issue of appropriate emergency accommodation for families who are homeless and that they offer a better alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts.  However, a commitment on the length of time that children and families will be expected to spend in these family hubs before finding a permanent home is needed.  There is also an urgent need to implement national quality standards for homeless services.<\/p><p> Committee members will see from our annual report that children with mental health issues still have to jump hurdles to access necessary supports.  The services provided for children need to go to the children who need them when they are needed and in the way in which they are needed.  This is not what is happening.  At present, a child must take what the system can offer and make do with what is available.  The child is doing all the adapting.  Children should not have to wait until they reach breaking point before they get some type of help.  I know committee members are aware of the various committees, reports and task force dealing with mental health issues.  I am sure they share my concerns that all of these mechanisms should not only work together, but lead to action for those children who are very much in need.  In this regard, I commend the work of Senator Freeman and her committee last year.<\/p><p> The national youth mental health task force report published in December included some very positive recommendations.  The recent establishment of a specific Oireachtas committee on the future of mental health is to be welcomed.  Again, I implore all Members of the Houses to demand results and outcomes for our young people.  Many young people have nobody to speak on their behalf or they do not feel able to speak out.  Oireachtas Members are their voices in the highest place in the land.  Please use that power effectively.  My office is undertaking consultations directly with children and young people who rely on mental health services.  There is no doubt whatsoever the service they receive and the supports they avail of now have a profound impact on their long-term outcomes.<\/p><p> Education remains a key issue for the office due to the number of complaints relating to education and due to the key legislation in train.  It is not that surprising that many of our complaints relate to education considering the amount of time young people spend in school.  It is also worth pointing out that many of the education complaints we receive overlap with health, disability or transport issues.  Our recent School Transport In Focus report is testament to this crossover.<\/p><p> The education (parent and student charter) Bill, which, to our delight, has been renamed the education (student and parent charter) Bill and which puts children at the centre, has been broadly welcomed by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  We believe promoting consistency in complaints handling, improving engagement and addressing issues as early as possible will minimise reliance on formal complaints procedures in the education system.  If passed, this may, in time, reduce the number of education complaints we receive.<\/p><p> Child protection is always one of my key concerns, and while there was a slight drop in the number of complaints relating to it in 2016, 23% remains a large proportion.<\/p><p>I have been vocal previously in my criticism of Tusla's delay in dealing with complaints which come to my office.  However, I am happy to acknowledge a marked improvement in this regard for 2016.  The introduction of mandatory reporting may result in an increase in referrals to Tusla and, perhaps, a subsequent increase in complaints to my office and it is essential, therefore, that adequate resources are provided to deal with this.  The reporting of any and all child protection concerns can, in my view, only be a good thing.<\/p><p> Another area I would like to mention briefly is health.  In 2016, we saw an increase in the number of health complaints received by the office.  The health system is still not operating to a satisfactory level and too many children are still getting caught up in administrative problems that are impacting their treatment.  Never has this been clearer than in the case of children suffering from scoliosis.  In 2016, we received a number of complaints about this issue and in March 2017 we published a report highlighting scoliosis as a children's rights issue.  Many commitments have been made by the Government to meet the demand for scoliosis treatment but, unfortunately, there are still issues for children waiting for diagnosis or surgery.  I am concerned that while the numbers on waiting lists are decreasing, children whose surgery has been outsourced to the UK, France or Germany, on arrival in those countries are being deemed unsuitable.  Where do those children fit into the waiting lists on their return?  We cannot allow waiting lists and administrative practices to worsen an already terrible condition.<\/p><p> The final area I would like to comment on is direct provision.  Members will note that in our annual report for 2016 and in previous annual reports we have called for children in direct provision to have the same access to complaints procedures as other children living in Ireland.  In April 2017, the necessary steps were taken to allow us to begin to accept these complaints.  Since that time, myself and my team have travelled across the country and visited all of the centres, including the emergency reception orientation centres, EROCs, where children are living.  By and large, we observed extremely passionate and hard working staff in direct provision centres and EROCs but we were shocked at the difference in standards between the centres.  It seems to be pot luck whether a child ends up in a warm, pleasant, well-resourced centre or a centre where facilities are simply not to the same standard.  There continues to be a reluctance among those living in direct provision and EROCs to come forward and make complaints, which is of concern to me.  It is also clear that direct provision allowance is not adequate to support normal family living and that the provision to allow people in direct provision to work will not in and of itself solve that problem.  These are only a few of the issues that have come to my attention since April 2017.  We will continue to work in this area in 2018.<\/p><p> I thank members of the committee for taking the time to listen to my contribution, which I hope clearly sets out the work we are doing to promote children's rights and a child centred approach across the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516109400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>As we must vacate this room at 3.15 p.m. I propose to allocate five to six minutes speaking time to each member.

I understand that preparations for it had been thorough in most regards.  I have engaged with the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, and they appear to be still rolling out a lot of the training in that regard.  There will likely be a slow change.<\/p> <p>  Mandatory reporting has been well flagged but the specific implications for individuals is still coming to the fore as schools re-open and the measure comes into effect.  It is vital that this is adequately resourced from a Tusla point of view and that everybody is aware of the implications for them of being a mandatory reporter.  We also need to review this measure on an annual basis to determine the impact of it.  It is often lost in the argument about resources that the rationale for this is because we have failed our children so often before.<\/p> <p>  Aside from mandatory reporting, there are other good elements in the Bill which allow Tusla and other people to analyse the safety statements and work of organisations, including religious orders, sporting organisations and so on.  These are extra safeguards that will come to the fore over time.<\/p><p>It is an active and important aspect of the Bill.  I welcome its introduction.  I look forward to seeing the impact and if it does need to be further resourced, that must be followed through on by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  From my point of view, I look forward to it making a positive impact because its essence is there still are children who have not been able to come forward.  That is the key thing.  If a teacher has a good relationship with a child, he or she is more than likely to be the person.  If it is a sports coach or the parent in a cr&egrave;che, wherever it might be, that person now has the opportunity to be the voice for that child.

Dr. Muldoon's report presents some sober reading for members.  With a certain degree of collective responsibility in mind, it is perhaps an indictment of how the political system engages <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>protecting the rights of children in this State.  My head is slightly hung down on this one because there is a certain sense of embarrassment or shame that the political system has not prioritised the care of our children within the State to the extent that it should.  As a Member of the D&aacute;il for ten years at this stage, I also consider myself partly responsible for that to a certain extent.  As an individual and a new member to this committee, care of children has not been in the top echelons of political priorities.  I say that in a honest and open fashion.<\/p><p>In the short time available to me, I wish to speak to Molly's case.  I am startled that there are 471 children with severe disabilities who are in foster care, in de facto State care, who need additional supports but who are fighting for those additional supports.  I am aware of one case in my own area.  Did Molly have a care plan?  My understanding is that every child should now have a care plan and that care plan should be followed up upon.

The case spans 14 years.  It was initially the responsibility of the HSE's child and family services, which then moved to Tusla at the beginning of 2014.  As we said in the report, during that time the social workers did engage in exhaustive advocacy.

The witnesses have spoken about direct provision.  I am also interested in what happens to undocumented individuals.

They are petrified about communicating with services due to being undocumented.  They believe they could end up in a worse scenario than children in direct provision and be deported.  These undocumented children have become an integral part of the community and are in education.  When one considers their undocumented status one must talk about the visa details that have been stamped on the passports.  As a result they can complete their leaving certificate course but they cannot access third level education.  This year nine such children in Gort sat their leaving certificate examination.  Unfortunately, none of them could get into third level education because of the passport stamp on the passports of their parents.  <\/p> <p>  I want to discuss Oberstown.

I have met a number of very articulate and intelligent young people who are as Irish as can be yet their fear of being deported to a place they have never even seen just because their parents originally came from there is palpable.  I contend that members of the Oireachtas must find a way to legislate for such instances.  Politicians have spent a lot of energy trying to legislate for the undocumented Irish in America.  Can an amnesty or legislative option be provided that will give undocumented children here the opportunity to come clean and emerge out of the shadows?  It behoves us to do so.  There are 5,000 children in this situation, which is more than are in direct provision and lots of other areas.  Such children have a huge contribution to make to this State.<\/p><p>However, after they finish the leaving certificate there is no personal public service, PPS, number or opportunity to be in third level education where they can thrive.  We are losing a great deal of opportunity in that way as well.  I do not have an answer, but I wonder if a conversation should be conducted in the Houses of the Oireachtas to try to do something about that.<\/p><p> Regarding Oberstown, 2016 was certainly a tumultuous year.  I am aware that both the director and representatives of the management appeared before the committee in the recent past.  Again, we engage actively with Oberstown.  We have an in-reach there on a monthly basis and we engage with the young people directly across the different units.  I have regular meetings and ongoing contact with both the chairman and the director.  From our point of view, there are always things that could be improved.  We are awaiting the publication of the judgment from the High Court.  What has been reported in the newspapers highlighted concerns around the quality of reports, policies, administration and the like.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was also very critical of some areas.  We are very much aware of that and we look into it any time we engage with Oberstown.  However, we put an emphasis on trying to meet and be a resource to the young people as quickly as possible when we are out there, to let them know we are available.  It is same as we are doing with direct provision - creating a relationship with unit managers and ensuring that if people wish to make complaints they can come to us.<\/p><p> The overall concept of Oberstown is moving in the right direction but there is a great deal of work to be done in that regard.  Deputy Sherlock talked about the non-publication of the report by Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nicholas Hardwick.  That is unfortunate.  When one seeks transparency from that organisation, it is crucial to call in such experts.  It is a shame that the publication has not happened, whatever the legal advice.  I am aware that the authors were happy to work with Oberstown to try to find a way to publish a report of some type, so it is unfortunate that we have a set of recommendations with no context.  I am concerned about that.<\/p><p> With regard to Tusla, my colleague, Nuala Ward, the director of investigations, knows the details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#P01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We have a positive engagement with Tusla.

In terms of the complaints we receive from Tusla, it is noteworthy that a number of them are directly from children who are in care because they are supported by various advocacy groups to come to us.

It is difficult to listen to the sadness that exists.<\/p> <p>  I have a three-part question regarding Dr. Muldoon's capacity to handle these complaints.  First, is 1,600 a large number?  Given that there are over 1 million children in this country, that does not appear to be a massive figure.  It is a terrible amount but I am surprised.  One of the groups of people I deal with - I call them the warriors - are parents who have children in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, system and in the disability services.  There are 12,000 of them, so is 1,600 a big figure?  Second, how does the Ombudsman for Children promote itself?  Several people have contacted me in the past couple of months about certain difficulties.  I am sorry that I keep forgetting to refer them to the Ombudsman for Children.  Dr. Muldoon says that children know about him, but we need to get his name out to the parents to let them know he will handle these matters.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to where there is a complaint about, for example, access to disability services.  I am aware of a child who is waiting six years to be assessed.  We believe he is on the autistic spectrum.  If that complaint went to Dr. Muldoon's office, how quickly would it be resolved?  Is it resolved more quickly because he is addressing it with the HSE or a disability service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#Q00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>One of the difficulties with any complaints service is that it is hard to know how many complaints we should be getting.  Certainly, it has been a priority of mine to increase awareness of the office.  In that regard we are, thankfully, bringing in two new team members in our education and participation office which will increase our opportunities to do outreach work in different parts of the country over the next year.  They will come into the office in February.  We also mentioned the &quot;tune in&quot; consultation which allows us to try to meet young people where they are.  We went around the country and asked where they wanted to hear about this.  Surprisingly, the majority agreed that they wanted to hear about it from teachers at both secondary and national school level.  That was followed very closely by those wishing to hear from parents.  As such, we have to target those people.  We will target them through YouTube clips and we have hired a new social media officer and created Snapchat and Instagram accounts, albeit I am not 100% <i>au fait<\/i>with those.  Those are the places they want to hear from us.  We asked them where they would look for the things they needed and those are the places.  We are trying to create social media activity on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat so that young people who need to know about us and their rights will find it on their platforms.<br\/><br\/>We are trying to raise awareness all the time and we are engaging with adults at all levels.  I have a very close relationship with teachers' associations, including those for principals and the INTO.  We engage with them so that they are aware we are available.  We also engage with parents' groups and advocacy groups like the Warriors and associations for the parents of children with special needs.  I engage with them all the time and attend the annual general meetings of their organisations.  We all try to raise awareness as often as we can.  It is difficult to know when we will have reached the right level of awareness.  In fact, I do not think we ever will.  The whole essence of what we do should also mean we are increasing our complaints because we should always become aware and the more we are aware, the more new people will know about us.  The essence of this work is that we are only sought when someone needs us.  What we have to do, however, is plant enough seeds so that people know about us now even if they do not need us until ten years later.  I am spending a lot of time trying to meet young people in secondary schools.  I tell them that they will be the parents in ten years time.  If they know about us and children's rights, they will be the ones who can fight for their children's rights in a different way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1516109400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>What about the speed of complaints?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>We have a target of 12 to 14 months for a full investigation where everything works smoothly and all the organisations work with us.

One does not want them all marching up and down on strike over everything that might be listed in the journal, but it would certainly raise awareness of rights.  It would be a simple tool to use if schools got on board.<\/p><p>I am delighted that we have had an Ombudsman for Children in this country for 14 years now.  We are eventually catching up with what children are privileged to have in other countries.  It is not a privilege, it is just a default position for them.<\/p><p> I wanted to ask about the mental health of our children in care and about the nature of the mental health complaints.  Senator Joan Freeman and myself were on the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  Are the complaints similar to what we heard there about access, continuity of care and time?  Are the complaints similar to that or is there anything unique in what children are putting forward to the ombudsman?  Is the number of complaints rising?  I would imagine it is because of the demand on services.  Does Dr. Muldoon agree that any such rise is because of demand on services or is it just because of particular people falling through the cracks?  <\/p><p> My other question was on disability.  Some 8% of children in care have a severe or moderate disability.   Does Dr. Muldoon have an idea of the timeline for the review which the HSE and Tusla have agreed to so we can all have a look at it?  I am delighted that Dr. Muldoon raised the issue of direct provision.  It has been referred to in the past.  It was established 20 years ago.  Children have been born and raised in that system.  It has been described as State-sanctioned child poverty and exclusion.  Those in the system now have the same access to the Ombudsman for Children for complaints.  On his visits and his travels throughout the country, did he speak to children directly?  The children who are probably most at risk are the children who are here alone and have no family around them.  Would he have had contact with them as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018011600002#R00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516109400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I love the idea of the school journal.  I will certainly steal that and see if we can get engaged with it in some way or other.  The mental health complaints are, as the Senator mentioned, on access to services, continuity of services when moving from child to adult services, and continuity when being transferred from one area to another.  Timelines are also a huge issue.  I will ask Ms Ward to come in if there are more issues on top of that.<\/p> <p>  On the overall mental health system, the work that Senators Devine and Freeman did is huge.  They identified that we do not have enough staff.  We do not have the staffing in the right place.  We do not have it in primary care where we need to prevent mental health issues.  There are difficulties with diagnosis and with consistency between child and adolescent mental health services teams.  One might diagnose a child as being ready to go in for an overnight bed and another might say that diagnosis does not fit, so the child does not get the bed.  Those issues are coming up continuously.<\/p> <p>  When I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who had responsibility for mental health at that time, she talked about at least five or six unfillable posts for psychiatrists.  These are posts which have not been filled for more than five years.  No organisation or business in the world would leave its offices open for five years without having found another way to fill the gap.  It is doing a huge disservice to our children in that area.  Up to now the clinical lead has always had to be a psychiatrist.  As I have suggested before, I wonder if there are other professionals who could take that lead for certain stages and at certain times.  If we look to other countries some have used psychologists to offer medication.  Certain nursing professionals have been allowed to dispense medication.  It may not just be about medication.  There may be other issues. <\/p> <p>  We have to look at the system as needing an overall change.  In that particular Seanad committee the Senator brought in some great witnesses.  They were fantastic.  There were a lot of good ideas which could be used.  Up until now we have been continuously trying to fix a broken system as opposed to seeing how we could look at the issue differently.  Primary care is a crucial part of that.  Tusla has talked about establishing what it calls therapy teams, which would include a range of therapists such as play therapists, drama therapists, art therapists and family therapists.  There would be a range of people who could intervene in a different way at a much earlier stage.  Such teams would not cost the earth.  That would make a huge difference at the primary care level.  Within CAMHS, there is never going to be enough psychiatrists.  From the people I have met, it sounds like 80% of all psychiatrists who train in Ireland go abroad.<\/p><p>One will never fill the vacant places if that continues to be the situation.  We must, therefore, acknowledge that and consider putting somebody else in place or allowing another professional to lead the team.  We have received complaints concerning children who have been left for possibly four or five days in a bed, waiting for a consultant to assess the child after he or she has come into an emergency department and said he or she is suicidal.  That is not appropriate and is very far from the right way to be child-centred.  Such a child is in the worst case in his or her life and the worst situation he or she can think of.  He or she feels ready to take his or her own life but we are doing them a huge disservice because we do not have enough consultants and only consultants are allowed to assess such children.  We are traumatising such children again and are, essentially, locking them up in a bed when they should be supported in some other way.  It is a result of our system and the way the legislation is set up that we are tied into that but that legislation could be changed within a year or two if we needed to and there was a will to do so.  I am not saying what professional should be given the responsibility of treating such children but if one profession is not creating enough new staff to fill that space, we have to widen it for the sake of the children, even if only temporarily.  Senator Devine has got her finger exactly on the button in regard to the complaints we receive.  It is a crisis that is long overdue fixing.<\/p><p> I have also called for a version of A Vision for Change solely dealing with children to be generated.  That would change the focus because one would then assess, evaluate, fund and resource it in a different way because they will be treated as children and as rights holders in their own right.

At least if they knew in the fifth year there would be something new, they would have some hope.

We also feel that the family hubs options are poised to be very similar to direct provision; we created a very good system for what we thought was going to be the very small number of people who were to come in to direct provision.  It could be very difficult to move on from the family hubs option.  We have specifically asked the Minister to tell us how long people are in family hubs.  The statistics will often look at those who are in hotels and about the success of moving people in to family hubs, but not for how long.  We now need to know the numbers of every family have been in a family hub.  Anyone who has been there for longer than six months should be a priority to move on again.  As the family hub option is a better service it could easily become institutionalised.  For a lot of people a family hub could be a good place to stay, so we need to be careful of this also.  It is our view that it should only be a stop-gap that leads to a more permanent solution.

I will make sure that, in all my other appearances before the committee in the coming year, the members will get my statement when they need it and when I have seen it, as has been the case in the past.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here to deal with both the tracker mortgage issue and the Our Public Service 2020 initiative.  I acknowledge the work of the committee in all its efforts to bring the tracker scandal to the fore and the progress it has made, in particular by taking testimony from people who have been significantly harmed by the unacceptable actions of banks.  I assure committee members and the public that the Government is treating this matter very seriously and is determined that the situation be resolved to the satisfaction of impacted customers as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Owing to the work of the Central Bank, particularly in its implementation of the industry-wide tracker mortgage examination, it has been clearly demonstrated that mortgage lenders failed significantly in their regulatory and contractual responsibilities to many tracker mortgage borrowers.  The failure of the banks in this regard has imposed significant harm on their customers.  It is now their responsibility to put that right and to do so without further delay. <\/p><p> The fair treatment of consumers is a key requirement of the financial services regulatory frameworks and the Central Bank consumer protection code.  The code requires all residential mortgage lenders to act fairly and honestly in the best interests of their customers and not to mislead their customers about the products they provide.  It also requires lenders to make full disclosure of all relevant information to a consumer in a way which seeks to inform the consumer and to enable a consumer to make an informed decision before entering into or changing a loan or other financial services agreement.  Through their treatment of some of their mortgage customers, lenders have shown a complete disregard for the code and have demonstrated that within these financial institutions ethical and cultural issues remain that need to be addressed.  The Central Bank has for some time made clear to lenders that they had and have a duty to act in the best interests of their consumers when recommending that a borrower switch a tracker mortgage to another type of mortgage product.<\/p><p> Prior to the commencement of the industry-wide tracker investigation, the Central Bank identified and pursued a number of tracker-related failings with a number of mortgage lenders.  These failures related to issues ranging from a lack of transparency for the borrower, a failure to fully inform customers of the consequences of switching from a tracker mortgage, the application of incorrect tracker rates and a failure to afford customers their contractual entitlements to specified tracker interest rates.  At the same time, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was receiving individual tracker mortgage-related complaints.  The Ombudsman adjudicated on these cases.  In addition, some of these cases came before the courts.  The growing number of issues relating to tracker mortgages raised concerns in the Central Bank that there may have been other tracker-related issues.  As a consequence of this, the Central Bank announced in October of 2015 that it had commenced a broader industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage-related issues.<\/p><p> The system-wide review was intended to cover, among other things, the transparency of communications with and the contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.  This has become the most complex and significant consumer protection review ever undertaken by the Central Bank.  It covered 15 lenders who may at the time have sold a tracker mortgage product, from the time the lender commenced selling tracker mortgages until December 2015, and involved the review of more than two million accounts by lenders.  As such, it covers both banks and other related mortgage lenders and also includes lenders who no longer provide new mortgage credit.  It also covers mortgages which have been redeemed and borrowers whose tracker mortgages have been transferred to another creditor.  The industry-wide examination requires all lenders to examine the extent to which they have been meeting their contractual obligations to their tracker mortgage customers or their compliance with their obligations under the Central Bank's consumer protection code.  <\/p><p> The Central Bank has published a number of update reports since it began its work, the latest of which came last December.  The latest update in the case showed that approximately 26,600 customers have been identified as having been impacted pursuant to the industry-wide examination.  This is an increase of 13,600 on the position as outlined in the earlier update in October.  The acceptance of further impacted tracker mortgage accounts by lenders, such as the 6,000 additional impacted accounts accepted by the Bank of Ireland in December, is proof that the Central Bank's strategy of continuously challenging lenders is having important benefits for consumers.  In total, 33,700 customers have been identified as having been impacted owing to mortgage failures.  This includes the 7,100 impacted tracker borrowers that were identified prior to the commencement of the industry-wide examination.  The Central Bank now believes the vast majority of impacted tracker mortgage customers have been identified.  It will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by lenders.  Following the Central Bank's October progress update, and owing to my and the Government's concern on the very slow progress on the provision of revision and compensation to impacted customers, I met with the CEOs of the five banks and made clear to them that all affected customers are to be identified and provided with appropriate redress and compensation as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>While some payments had been made at that time, they were small in number, they were too low, and many impacted borrowers were still unclear as to whether they would hear from their lender.  Following these meetings, the banks in question made certain and specific commitments with regard to the payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers.  I note that in December, the Central Bank confirmed that the five main mortgage lenders were on course to meet their October commitments, and that known issues around disputed groups in respect of certain lenders had been resolved to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>As of the end of December, approximately &euro;250 million in redress and compensation has been paid to 12,900 customers, as identified from the examination.  This includes payments to 3,700 impacted accounts identified since last September.  This is in addition to the &euro;47 million awarded in compensation and redress.  This payment to outstanding impacted borrowers is a key requirement, and it must be a practical demonstration of the regret that banks are now expressing for the harm they have inflicted on their impacted tracker borrowers. <br\/><br\/>The level of compensation offers are in the first instance a matter for the individual mortgage lender.  It is the lenders that caused the harm to their customers, and therefore the primary responsibility for putting that right should rest with the lenders.  The level of compensation should be proportionate to the harm and to the stress caused, and individual lenders should have regard to this when they make compensation payments to their customers.  The provision of fair and appropriate compensation offers upfront will minimise the risk of causing further inconvenience and hurt to impacted customers, and will go some small way towards giving a practical expression to the words of regret heard in recent months.  Of course, in more difficult cases, such as those where people lost their homes, the lender will need to consult closely with the impacted borrowers on the level of detriment which has occurred and, therefore, the total level of redress and compensation which is appropriate in their particular circumstances.  However, urgent consideration should be given to these cases by the banks, and they should not be deferred and put to the end of the line for payment. <br\/><br\/>It is also important to have an independent appeals process in place to deal with the customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress package they receive from lenders, and the Central Bank tracker redress framework<b><\/b>provides for this process.  This will give any customer the right to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation offered.  This can in the first instance be the appeals panel provided for under the tracker framework, but impacted tracker borrowers also have the right to take their course to the Financial Services Ombudsman or ultimately to the courts. <br\/><br\/>A fundamental element of the redress and compensation process is that the upfront payment by a lender cannot be reduced in any subsequent appeal made by the borrower, either through the appeals process under the tracker examination framework, or ultimately the ombudsman or the courts.  The detailed appeals process set out in the Central Bank's framework for conducting the tracker examination allows borrowers to take the matter further without risk to themselves if they consider that the level of upfront payment is not appropriate in their particular case.  This appeals process will also allow the individual borrower to set out the full individual circumstances, and to set out in detail the full harm imposed by them on the lender and consequently why a higher level of payment may be appropriate. <br\/><br\/>In terms of enforcement, I believe the existing supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank are strong and should be used to punish wrongdoing when supported by evidence.  The Central Bank has also demonstrated that it is willing to use the full extent of its powers, as evidenced by its imposition in 2016 of a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million on Springboard Mortgages Limited for serious failings.  The Central Bank has also advised that it is pursuing enforcement investigations in relation to Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank, and has commenced another enforcement investigation.  The Central Bank has stated that it expects that all the main mortgage lenders will face enforcement investigations in due course.  The Central Bank also has statutory reporting obligations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or another relevant statutory agency where information obtained by it, at any stage prior to, during or after an investigation gives rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence may have been committed.<\/p><p> In light of this appalling behaviour, I have taken a number of further actions.  I have mandated, under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank to prepare a report on the current culture and behaviour and the associated risks in the retail banks and actions that banks may take to ensure that customer interests are better prioritised in the future.  On foot of this report, the Government will determine whether any additional legislative and regulatory changes are needed to enhance accountability in the banks.  In addition, I announced two further measures, namely, to double the level of compensation to &euro;500,000 that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman may award to a consumer who has been adversely affected by the action of a financial services provider and to appoint two new members to the Central Bank Commission who have a strong consumer protection profile.  <\/p><p> I also note and welcome the initiative from the banking industry to establish an Irish banking standard board to broadly mirror the approach adopted in the UK.  However, this is an initiative from the banking sector and it will not minimise or reduce any existing or proposed legislative or regulatory change.  <\/p><p> The examination has laid bare the facts that very poor cultural and governance issues still exist within lending institutions in Ireland post the banking crash and that if banks are to regain the trust of consumers, they must be prepared to change their attitude significantly.  Customers of these lenders have been treated appallingly and, in some cases, have lost their homes, either directly or indirectly, due to the shameful behaviour of their lenders.  This behaviour is simply unacceptable.  <\/p><p> The Government will continue to support the Central Bank in its efforts to complete the tracker examination as soon as possible and I will receive a further update at the end of March of this year.  If further sufficient progress regarding the payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers has not been made at that point, the Government will be prepared to consider further possible actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The Minister and his officials are very welcome to this meeting.

An extra 13,600 were identified on top of the 13,000 in the first two years of the examination.  Therefore, something changed within a very short period.  The Central Bank has not minced its words and it is to its credit that it has engaged in straight talking, of late at least, on this issue.  The evidence from the Central Bank indicates that the banks have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to identify the right customers to whom to provide redress and compensation.  In the Minister's view, what led to such an about-turn and such a dramatic increase in the number of customers identified?  Some 13,000 were identified in two years and in the following period of less than three months, another 13,600 were identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#K00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>In answering the Deputy's question, I will reiterate a point I made when I debated this matter with him and the rest of the committee towards the end of last year, namely, that there are two issues that I find unacceptable about the way this matter has been handled to date.  The first is the root cause of this, that is, the behaviour that led to people being treated wrongly and unfairly at great cost to themselves, both financially and from a health perspective.  The second matter that was of equal concern to me was the reaction of the banks to the Central Bank probe and the difficulties to which the Central Bank referred on a number of occasions towards the end last year.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the number of affected accounts went up from 13,000 to 26,600.  Since we last engaged on this matter and since last September alone, a further 13,600 customers have now been accepted by the lenders into the redress and compensation scheme.  I said then that what was of equal concern to me in treating fairly the people who have been identified is identifying who else was treated unfairly by the banks.<\/p><p> As for what changed, I believe the Central Bank's investigation was making progress at the time.  The banks were dealing with the investigation.  It became clear to them the degree to which the Central Bank was determined to complete its work and unearth the scale of this issue and I believe my efforts, and those of the committee, were of assistance in making that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#K00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I would agree with that but I would also highlight the courage of those affected, the customers, in speaking out both here and in the media generally, some of whom the Minister has met.  They are largely responsible for the dramatic change in emphasis in the attention that was being given to this issue.  Their human stories probably spoke louder than any words any politician, banker or central banker could come up with.  However, even according to the last update from the Central Bank in December, there are still 13,700 - presumably the number has not changed dramatically - identified affected customers who await redress and compensation.  Redress is them being paid the money they were overcharged, that they should never have been overcharged, and then there is the compensation, which can vary by 10%, 20% or perhaps 30%.  Many of them will want to know from the Minister, who is the person with ultimate responsibility, when every customer affected by the tracker mortgage scandal will get their money back and be appropriately compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#L00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>On the deadline I have set in regard to conclusion of the matter overall, I have referred to March in the different statements I have made on the matter but I stress that my strong view is that everybody should be given both redress and an initial offer of compensation as soon as possible.

There is one bank in particular, Ulster Bank, as well as KBC, whose payments will continue into this year.  I want everybody to be repaid and compensated as soon as possible but the March report will give me the point at which I will evaluate whether those commitments have been met.<\/p> <p>  I should have said, and I agree with the Deputy's point, that when I referred to the committee it was not just the efforts of the committee members here but that some of the hearings here over a prolonged period crystalised the distress that many people were feeling.  However, what our efforts collectively have shown is that the issue has grown.  While I do not expect the total number of people who have been affected to grow by the same quantum the Deputy has just raised with me, when I get the figures from the Central Bank in March there is the possibility that they could be higher than the figures he has referred to because there is an investigation under way.

I have one last question.  There are many people who not only want adequate compensation and to get the money that was wrongly taken from them back but they want accountability.  They want somebody to pay the price.  They want somebody to be held responsible.  They do not want this swept under the carpet.<\/p> <p>  That takes me to the final question on the issue of compensation and of being put back on the appropriate tracker rate.  We had a motion passed in the D&aacute;il.  I tabled an amendment to Deputy McGrath's motion in the D&aacute;il, which proposed to \"ensure all customers are put back onto the rate applicable as per their contract\".  I am sure the Minister knows, because the committee knows, there are countless people out there who have been offered redress and compensation but are being put back on a rate they completely and utterly dispute.  There is an issue with the prevailing rate at the time.  In some cases, rates are 2% and 3% above what they believe should have been the tracker rate at the time.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kissane, who comes in before the committee, has been a leading light in this and has argued this point very passionately.  Is this Minister dealing with the issue?  Is he willing to take on the issue of the prevailing rate on behalf of customers and also the pathetically inadequate level of compensation being offered to victims when one considers the suffering they and their families went through?  It is 10%, 15% and even 20%, and &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 is being offered in compensation for money that was taken from people at a time of deep austerity.  I will not rehearse what these families went through because we all know these individual stories.  The type of compensation being offered by these financial institutions to their victims is pathetic.  Will the Minister be the person to take on the five institutions, particularly AIB and Permanent TSB, on the issue of the prevailing rate?  Will he also make sure there is adequate compensation or will we just draw a line under this by saying everybody is getting their money back, there is a bit of compensation and hope the issue will disappear in 2018?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#Q00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I have no interest in sweeping this matter under the table or allowing it to disappear.

Most of the dealings I have had on the matter have been about people not knowing where they stand in the process.  Clearly the decision that is made on that matter is a matter for the regulator.

That is, effectively, a similar thing to what Governor Lane is saying.  What the Minister said earlier about a potential tension between the perceived responsibilities of public interest directors, their responsibilities to the banks and the public interest was illustrative because for some reason banking interest is not identical to public interest.  It is separate.  Banking interest exists to maximise their profit.

This is quite central to capitalism.  It is quite central to the idea of private for-profit corporations; the very nature of their existence means they seek profitability even if it is to the detriment of their customers.  That happens right across the market in many different ways but it is particularly extreme in the banks.  The other point is that AIB and PTSB are not privately held companies; they are publicly owned companies.  They are publicly owned companies without public interest directors or any directors from the State currently operating on them.  Throughout the course of this time, the Government and the State and the public had ownership of a large portion of the banking sector in Ireland and did absolutely nothing with it.  It did not do anything with the public interest directors or the fact we own the banks.  Is that not a fundamental flaw?  The culture of running the banks for profit came from the Government which owned the banks and which said it wanted them to return to profitability.  I do not mean that the Government wanted them to screw the customers in the way that happened with tracker mortgages.  I do not think it wanted that but I think it told them it wanted them to maximise profits and return to profitability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#R01100","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Deputy.

In order to hit the kind of balance the Deputy is referring to, we need strong regulation and independent institutions like the Central Bank.  Where banks are different from many other companies is their viability and that what they do is fundamentally interwoven into modern economies.

It is not just the long-term consequences, the short-term consequences when our banks were unprofitable and unable to fund themselves did huge damage to our economy and changed the nature of our country.

Does the Minister not agree that that and the subsequent scandals mean the private sector model of banking ownership has failed and that the tension that exists between the public interest and the banking interest is a fundamental problem?  The way to overcome those interests is to have actual public democratic ownership of the banks, bring together public and banking interest and run the banks to assist the economy and society as a whole as opposed to allowing the banks to rob, steal and profit from the economy and people within the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#S00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis from 2008 and 2009 and 2010, the then Government looked to tackle the culture that existed in the banks then.

It was done by changes in the regulatory environment.  For example, the amount of resourcing that is available to the Central Bank has now doubled versus where we were in 2009 precisely because of our efforts to tackle cultural change.  My view is what we were doing then is talking about a set of cultures that led our banks to lend in a way that was not sustainable.  Efforts were made to tackle and change that.  What I am talking about is another dimension of that which is to balance the rights of the consumer and the profitability of a bank.  That is one of the issues I expect the Central Bank to address when it comes back to me later in the year.

They should not have been moved on to the different rates.  In many cases, some people incurred a degree of financial loss and for some citizens, the financial loss was gigantic and life changing.  While our banks will have to account for it on their balance sheets and with their investors as they deal with this matter - a number of them already have - that needs to happen.  This issue must be dealt with because where people have been treated wrongly, we must ensure that it is recognised and dealt with.<\/p> <p>  On the separate issue put to me by the Senator regarding the difference between the standard euro area mortgage rate or lending rate and the rate in Ireland, there are other factors driving that difference.  One of the largest of them is that we still have an amount of non-performing loans in our economy that are having an effect on the balance sheets of the banks, which in turn is having an effect on the rate of interest at which banks can lend out.  That matter needs to be dealt with carefully by the banks during the coming period.  They are subject to supervision by the Single Supervisory Mechanism in respect of this.  In respect of the second factor, which I would like to see change in the future, I would like to see as much competition in our banking sector as possible because that is an antidote to rates being offered to people that might be very high.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#V00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Does that not indicate it is the consumer who pays at the end of the day?

I do not expect the Minister to know the in-depth analysis of it all, but as the Minister for Finance he is ultimately the person people look to for comfort on their tracker mortgages.  I am sure some people who took out mortgages with Bank of Scotland and who may have switched to another institution and paid off their mortgage still do not know whether they were affected.  Will there be a process where every person with a mortgage is told: \"Your account was examined.  We don't believe there was anything wrong with it.\"<\/p><p>This examination was done by the Central Bank, which looked at 2 million mortgage accounts.

That involved the Central Bank looking at the audit trails, its own staff engaging with the staff of the four banks and then the Central Bank making an adjudication as to whether the figures were correct.  That is why at the time when I was speaking on this matter in here and elsewhere in the Oireachtas, I said on a number of occasions that just as important to me as dealing with the people who have been identified - and know they have been identified - is all those people who do not know yet that they were a victim of this.<\/p> <p>  The word \"cohorts\" was used to identify this.

The total number of impacted cases emerging from that work is approximately 300.  This is just under 1% of the total number of cases we have dealt with.

We are now at the level of numbers that had been predicted by Padraic Kissane when he appeared before the committee.  This was a figure that had not been accepted by the banks.  As we commence 2018 and these hearings, I will give a flavour of the correspondence I have received by email.  This individual was put back on to a tracker mortgage in 2016 and continued to contact the bank to find out when the bank would repay the money, when compensation or redress would be paid and so on.  Ulster Bank kept on telling this person that it could not tell as it did not know.  This email is dated 11 January.  No one could tell her and no one could answer the questions.<\/p><p>I have received another email from another bank customer who was put back on a tracker mortgage by KBC when the person was confirmed last week as being an impacted case.

It is important to note that on the date KBC was before the committee, the bank told us nothing.  It refused to tell the committee anything.  From the emails that are starting to come in now at the beginning of 2018, we can see there is ongoing frustration and anger with the banks in not dealing with all of the cases.  This is the fear I have.  There is also a continued reluctance on the part of the banks to show any sign of co-operation.  They have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to this point.

I want to ask the Minister a question on foot of that.  Any of the vulture funds that we have invited here have refused to come before us.  Capita and Pepper are considering the invitation.<\/p><p>As they are regulated entities working on behalf of the vulture funds, I would like to see the Department in any exchanges it might have with them insisting that they take up the invitation to be accountable to the public in a forum like this.  In the case of Capita, in particular, the experience Members of the Houses have had in dealing with it is frightening.  To find young men and women in the banking sector being encouraged to go down the route they are going in how they deal with customers is shocking in itself.  It will leave a legacy in our banks, that may well employ these people, that will continue this attitude towards customers.  It has been and continues to be very difficult for people to engage with them.  We are at a stage now within the economy where people are having to engage with these organisations.  In whatever way we can we should consider legislation that would force them to look at customers' rights and their obligations to ensure those rights are protected.  That does not happen; in fact it is quite the opposite.  I know a number of Members who have acted on behalf of customers with these agencies and they have come away in complete shock.  I am not easily shocked but when I saw the younger people coming on in Capita who were doing that work, it disturbed me that this would be going on in Irish society and our economy.  It will be interesting to see if they accept our invitations but we must be far more aggressive to ensure they comply with the law; we should introduce new laws if necessary where we see gaps in the existing laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#DD01100","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>We do not have - and I do not have - engagement with those organisations.  The Chairman spoke about this matter when I came before the committee in December.  These organisations, as is the case with any bank or financial entity regulated in Ireland, should be meeting people in a way that reflects the letter and spirit of the law.  I have asked my Department to examine this issue as it has been raised with disturbing frequency throughout November and December.  It seems the Chairman and other committee members have examples of this behaviour and they may wish to share them with me, not in this public meeting but afterwards.  I expect people to be treated with the respect that should be accorded to them.  I know discussions between customers and their banks can be very difficult at times but they can be conducted in a proper manner.  That is why I have approached the tracker mortgage issues in the way I have.  Both I and the Central Bank have standards that we expect to be met.  The leaders of our banks do, I believe, want to see change in their cultures and to renew the way in which customers are dealt with.  As Minister for Finance, I see the management of this issue being at the heart of the relationship economies have with banks.  I am not satisfied with how this has been handled to date and the tracker mortgage issue is the most glaring example of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#EE00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>It is good to hear that Minister.

An individual had called on behalf of the bank to serve papers on her, and to say she was petrified would be an understatement.  I put her straight onto someone who is involved in this area to deal with the bank.  There is a problem, however, and the banks will have to change their mode of operation.  The banks have to realise that they cannot go back to dealing with individuals as they previously did.  That is one instance of a case which involved a mainstream bank.  <\/p><p> What is now happening is that the banks are reviewing a lot of cases.  While there may be a rule book and codes in place, I suspect that there is pressure on individuals at management level in banks to get loans in and people are cutting corners.  They are not taking into account individual circumstances, as was the case with this particular lady, who is doing everything in her power to pay her mortgage although she just could not pay the full amount.  I do not generally speak about these matters because they are private but this is an example of a mainstream bank dealing with a customer in a completely inappropriate way.  The bank was dealing with her as a back street moneylender or whatever one might want to call it would do.  A mob-style approach was adopted in dealing with this particular lady who lives on her own.  It was a dark winter's evening and what was done was highly inappropriate.  This needs to be fed back into the banks.  This is about the person at the top who dictates the type of attitude and regime of the institution.  I do not buy the theory about individuals.  The banks need to deal with their customers in a legal fashion but also in a caring fashion.  They should not be coming out to people in the dead of night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#EE00400","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I will touch on the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015.  One of the modules we intend to touch on will be on how banks and vulture funds are dealing with loans in the SME sector.  The financial ombudsman is prohibited from dealing with a case which involves an SME with a turnover of more than &euro;3 million.  In Europe, an SME is considered to be anything up to &euro;50 million.  Does the Minister intend to review that in light of the changing circumstances and the fact that so many SMEs have performing loans which have gone, for example, through the global restructuring group, GRG, with Ulster Bank and have been sold on to vulture funds?  If the &euro;3 million limit was increased, it would mean that those SMEs could engage with the financial ombudsman, which they cannot do at the moment.  When these loans are transferred to vulture funds, the loan is often then owned by, for example, Goldman Sachs or an organisation that is substantially bigger than the client with the loan.  These clients simply cannot compete on legal fees while at the same time running a business and answering unreasonable questions.  What are the Minister's views on the Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#FF00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>To date, all of the feedback and evidence I have seen points to the effective operation of the Act.  I imagine that the key provision the Chairman is pointing to in the Act is that which provides the protections available to the person associated with the loan are not changed if the owner of the loan changes, particularly if it moves from a bank to an entity that is not a bank.  It has not been flagged to me to date that the cap the Chairman referred to is an issue.  However, on foot of the Chairman raising it, my Department will now examine the matter.  I know that conversations that happen between customers and banks can be very difficult at times but we have expectations, and I, as Minister for Finance, have expectations, regarding standards that should be met when those discussions should be happening.  I am satisfied that the protection that is currently in place is robust but I will seek a report on the cap issue to which the Chairman referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#GG00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am suggesting that the cap be changed because the Central Bank cannot deal with individual cases and the ombudsman is confined to dealing with cases where the amount involved is under &euro;3 million.  Where a business that is thriving and repaying its loans finds itself tied up with a vulture fund, there are often competing organisations in those vulture funds.  In other words, competitors may be owned by the same fund.  In order to protect themselves, their businesses and their employees, they have nowhere to turn to except the courts.  An SME is then fighting the likes of a giant vulture fund which has the money and the ability to chase them and make their lives miserable.  Therefore, instead of running the business, these SMEs are spending most of their time in the legal process and trying to sort out their affairs with a vulture fund.  It is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018011600002#GG00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1516111200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will meet the chairperson of the Credit Review Office tomorrow afternoon.

I imagine that what is driving this is that it is a consumer protection code as opposed to a protection code relating to businesses, for example.  I have not been advised of the kind of gap to which the Chairman refers but I will have a good opportunity to investigate the matter tomorrow afternoon.

Those involved are well able to have those conversations.  I am talking about the difference between a massive vulture fund that can almost treat the likes of those agencies here, in terms of the regulation of credit servicing, as puppets.  They just move them around.  Within their organisations, as they describe it, they have Chinese walls but there are competition issues within those vulture funds between the various properties that they have purchased.  There is an issue in that those who raised the loan in the first place cannot devote the type of time and money to getting their rights.  The law is weak in that area for the SME sector.  As I said, &euro;50 million is the limit applicable to SMEs in the European Union, yet it is &euro;3 million here.  If it is driven by something else, perhaps we should examine the need for the figure to be raised.
