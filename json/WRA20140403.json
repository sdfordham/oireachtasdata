Of the 47 members of the Council, 23 voted in favour, 12 voted against and 12 abstained.  The resolution was tabled by the United States, the United Kingdom, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mauritius and Montenegro.  The resolution requests that the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights undertake, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures, a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Government of Sri Lanka's own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).  In the course of intergovernmental negotiations on the text, Ireland was among those countries arguing for the strongest possible response by the Human Rights Council to the alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights carried out by both sides during the conflict in Sri Lanka.  We believe that the final text represents a good outcome, even if we would have preferred an even more robust stand-alone investigation mechanism.<\/p><p>  In previous resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council, the Council called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and commitments to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans.  Regrettably, as reported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, in her report of February 2014, the Government of Sri Lanka took only limited and piecemeal steps towards investigating serious allegations of violations, and none of these had the independence or credibility required. <\/p><p>  In a statement to the Council delivered by the Permanent Representative of Ireland on 26 March, prior to the adoption of the resolution, Ireland expressed support for the conclusions drawn by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in this regard and urged the Government of Sri Lanka to listen to the concerns of the Council and to accept fully the recommendations made by the High Commissioner.  Ireland called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner in the implementation of this latest resolution and we hope that cooperation will be forthcoming.  At the same time, we note that there are precedents for similar investigations being carried out without the cooperation of the State concerned, and have every confidence in the ability of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake a comprehensive investigation, as it has been mandated to do.  <\/p><p>  The High Commissioner will present an oral update to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session, in September 2014, and a comprehensive report will be presented to the twenty-eighth session, in March 2015.  It is premature to discuss the question of sanctions or any other measures.  Ireland has every confidence in the ability of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake a comprehensive investigation, as it has been mandated to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[15389\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way in which the recently announced &euro;3 million in aid to the Philippines will be spent; the way his Department is assisting communities that were affected by Typhoon Haiyan; and if there will be any additional aid given to the Philippines this year.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hit the Philippines on 8 November 2013.  It is estimated that the Typhoon affected more than 14 million people, with almost 4 million remaining displaced, including some 1.5 million children.  Over 6,000 lives are known to have been lost and almost 1800 people are still missing.<\/p><p>  Ireland was among the first to respond to this disaster, providing immediate, life-saving assistance.  Our commitment to date stands at over &euro;7.1 million and, with an additional estimated &euro;4 million in voluntary donations by the Irish public, this makes us one of the most generous contributors to this relief effort on a per capita basis.  Our commitment to respond effectively to this disaster was clearly underlined by Minister of State Costello's recent visit to the Philippines to witness at first hand the situation on the ground.  Over &euro;2.6million of Ireland's funding was provided through our key NGO partners.  It is being effectively utilised for the provision of emergency food and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency health care and the protection of vulnerable women and children.  It is benefitting up to 50,000 households.<\/p><p>  In the immediate aftermath of the Typhoon, we authorised four airlifts of essential relief items from our emergency pre-positioned stocks.  The total amount of essential relief items provided to date is 166 tonnes, valued at &euro;967,000.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also authorised a contribution of &euro;500,000 to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to support its work to restore the livelihoods of farmers affected by<i><\/i>the Typhoon.<\/p><p>  An enormous amount has been achieved over the past four months, including through Irish-funded programmes, some of which Minister of State Costello visited on the island of Leyte in the Philippines, where he saw at firsthand the devastation caused by the typhoon.  However, millions of people still require urgent assistance to rebuild their lives and livelihoods and strengthen their resilience to prepare for any future natural disasters in the region.  In late November of last year, the deployment of a Government technical mission was authorised in order to obtain a detailed analysis of the longer-term needs of the worst affected regions.  The recommendations from this technical mission include provision of additional funding of &euro;3 million for the recovery phase, which was announced during the Minister's recent visit to Tacloban on Leyte Island.<\/p><p>  This additional funding will be channelled through our long-standing humanitarian partners and, in accordance with the recommendations of the technical mission, will focus on shelter, livelihoods and protection support in worst-affected communities.

High Representative Ashton also issued a statement on 25 March expressing her utmost concern and reiterating the EU's complete opposition to capital punishment under all circumstances.  She reiterated these concerns when she met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmy on 31 March. <\/p><p>  The human rights situation in Egypt was also considered at the just concluded session of the UN Human Rights Council.

Four health care workers are among the victims.  While the epidemic was initially limited to the south-eastern part of the country, Guinea's Ministry of Health has recently reported four confirmed cases in the capital, Conakry.  Two confirmed deaths from the virus have been reported in Liberia and a further six cases are currently under investigation (including four deaths). There are six suspected cases (five reported deaths) in Sierra Leone.<\/p><p>  Guinea's Ministry of Health, together with the World Health Organisation and other partners, have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent a further spread.  The Ministry of Health has activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response.  Multidisciplinary teams have been deployed to the field to actively search and manage cases, trace and follow-up contacts and sensitize communities on prevention and control.  Since 2008, Ireland through the Irish Aid programme has provided &euro;2.5 million in funding to UN agencies and NGOs working in Guinea.

But I do not believe that it is divorced from other major preoccupations across Europe as we emerge from the severe and very long economic crisis.  This may well have contributed to a sense of detachment from the EU, which people appear to believe not to have delivered for them.  This democratic deficit also impacts on support for domestic governments.<\/p><p>  The subject is particularly topical ahead of elections to the European Parliament.  I am sure we have a shared hope to see some improvement in the trend of voter turnout for European elections come the end of May.  This Government will certainly work to ensure that the values and benefits of Europe are part of the electoral debate.  The key to addressing these citizens' concerns, of course, is to start with the biggest challenge which is the enormous numbers unemployed across Europe and particularly in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Recovery in the real economy is critical: we need to see firms expanding their activities and creating new jobs, including new firms in new growth areas.  Managing the economic crisis and supporting the recovery has been and remains the key focus of the European Council and the EU institutions more widely.  That includes agreeing to the multi-annual budget, front loading funds for youth employment, increasing the EIB's lending capacity and redirecting its focus to play a greater role in relation to SMEs where most jobs will come from.  Stabilising the banking system so that the economy can start to function effectively again is also a priority.  And it is worth noting that economic conditions across Europe are improving, albeit much slower than we would like.  Last year saw GDP in both the EU and euro area back in positive territory for the first time since late 2011.  And net job creation has now resumed in most Member States.  In Ireland, we have seen very welcome progress for a sustained period on the jobs front.<\/p><p>  In terms of what Europe can do to create the environment which will see employment growth, I think the focus has to be on the pragmatic: completing the single market, including in services and the digital single market, and improving the opportunities for trade &ndash; something which particularly benefits open economies such as our own.  The Government will be working with our partners to ensure that is where Europe and the incoming leadership of Europe concentrate their efforts in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":33,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[15404\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason US military aircraft at Shannon have not been routinely searched to ensure our neutrality is not being breached.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.

While remaining open for dialogue, the European Council recalled that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other hand.

There are now over 9.3 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, with a further 2.5 million Syrian refugees requiring assistance in neighbouring countries.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been doing all it can to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, having provided over &euro;20 million in assistance since the crisis began and committed a total of &euro;26 million.  As the humanitarian situation in Syria continues to deteriorate, Ireland is acutely aware of the high numbers of people inside Syria who have not received any assistance in a long period of time.  We have been consistent in our efforts to ensure that the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis, in particular on the issue of humanitarian access.<\/p><p>  While United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139 of February 22nd was a very welcome and necessary step in attempting to address humanitarian access and ease civilian suffering, full political weight now needs to be brought to bear through the UN Security Council to ensure its implementation.  Ireland is disappointed with the limited impact of this resolution on the ground to date as reported by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on March 24th.  One month after the passing of this resolution, humanitarian access in Syria remains extremely challenging for humanitarian organisations, with access to many areas still being denied. <\/p><p>  Ireland welcomes confirmation by the United Nations that a major cross-border convoy carrying vital humanitarian aid for Syrian civilians who are desperately in need, crossed from Turkey into North-Eastern Syria on March 21st.  However, the fact remains that humanitarian access across many parts of Syria is still exceptionally difficult as a result of the continued disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.<\/p><p>  The question of establishing no-fly corridors and safe havens within Syria is a complex one, in that to do so would necessitate the provision of foreign military protection and sanction by the UN Security Council which has not, as yet, provided such legal authorisation.  We share the caution of the United Nations&rsquo; humanitarian agencies, the International Red Cross\/Red Crescent Movement and many of our other partners in respect of potential military intervention in support of humanitarian action, which could have the unwelcome and unintended result of placing already vulnerable civilians and aid workers at further risk.  We believe that in most circumstances, negotiated access remains the most effective approach.  We support UN Under Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Baroness Amos, in her call for other measures such as humanitarian pauses to ensure safe and unhindered passage of humanitarian conveys into hard-to-reach areas and besieged communities.<\/p><p>  The Government has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.  We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians.  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA03950"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[15397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has taken any action at European Union level in relation to the release of Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti; if he has raised this issue with the Israeli Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>There has been no discussion at EU level in relation to bringing about the release of Marwan Barghouti, nor has the T&aacute;naiste raised the issue with the Israeli Government.Marwan Barghouti was sentenced in 2004 to five life sentences for murder, having been convicted of involvement in a number of attacks, including a suicide attack on Israeli civilians.

This included the cost of travel of Ministers and staff attached to Ministerial offices.  Of this total, the travel costs of the T&aacute;naiste and the costs of the staff attached to his office, amounted to &euro;102,412.  The overseas travel undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Trade and Development and myself, is fully in the national interest and represents good value for money.  <\/p><p>  The core functions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are predominantly concerned with international political and security policy, advancing reconciliation and cooperation on the island of Ireland, EU enlargement and external relations, and promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trade interests in Europe and internationally.  The overseas travel undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Trade and Development and I is in pursuit of these goals.  For example, the T&aacute;naiste travelled to the UN General Assembly in September 2013 to meet with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to discuss issues of critical importance including the ongoing conflict in Syria and the Middle East peace process, as well as co-chairing a major event on the Millennium Development Goals.<\/p><p>  Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers from the Department.  In 2013, the T&aacute;naiste undertook a political and trade mission to China (Beijing and Shanghai) at the invitation of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi.  The purpose of the visit was to strengthen the high-level political engagement necessary to deliver on the Strategic Partnership Agreement between Ireland and China.  He also had a series of engagements focused on supporting Irish companies doing business in China, promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, and promoting Ireland as the best investment location for Chinese businesses looking to expand in Europe.  In addition, he led an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Turkey. Deals secured during the visit are expected to reach well over &euro;30m in value.   <font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font><\/p><p>  Whenever Ministers travel on official business overseas, every effort is made to ensure that appropriate opportunities are taken for a substantive economic and promotional dimension to the visit.  In this regard, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the national day of any other country.  In March 2013, the T&aacute;naiste travelled to the United States, Ireland&rsquo;s most important source of Foreign Direct Investment, our largest market for exports of merchandise and a vital tourism market. <\/p><p>  The purpose of his travel there was to return maximum economic benefit to Ireland as well as availing of the political access available to advance issues such as maintaining vital US support for the Northern Ireland peace process, and on bilateral issues including US immigration reform.  Such Ministerial visits are also important to Irish communities abroad, and an occasion to engage with those of Irish descent, whose friendship and support is such an asset to us.Much of the travel undertaken in 2013 by the Minister for Trade and Development Joe Costello T<font color=\"#004080\">.<\/font>D<font color=\"#004080\">. <\/font>also included a substantial trade focus.  He led Enterprise Ireland trade missions to Canada, Belgium and South Africa\/Nigeria. <\/p><p>  The contracts won and the contacts made during trade missions lead to job creation and long-term economic benefits for Ireland.  In October, Minister Costello accompanied An tUachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann during state visits to Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  This visit reinforced Ireland&rsquo;s strong relations with these countries and served to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s interest in developing and expanding political and trade relations with the Latin American and Caribbean region.  Other overseas travel undertaken by him included travel related to international humanitarian and development issues, including travel to Irish Aid programme countries.  His total travel costs in 2013 were &euro;43,277.<\/p><p>  The travel costs for the Department in 2013 included exceptional once-off costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first six months of 2013.  The travel costs for former Minister of State for EU Affairs Lucinda Creighton T.D. amounted to &euro;70,894 in 2013.  In her capacity as then Minister for European Affairs during the Presidency, she travelled almost 200,000km and visited 44 countries.  In succeeding Deputy Creighton in this role, I have built upon the excellent work conducted during the Presidency.  As part of my role as Minister for European Affairs, I attended the monthly meetings of the General Affairs Council and the European Council with the Taoiseach as well deputising for Minister Noonan at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council and Eurogroup. <\/p><p>  It is the firm belief of the Government that our relationship with the Member States of the European Union is an essential element of our foreign policy agenda, both in the realm of bilateral relations and in the context of the European Union.  To this end, I undertook eleven bilateral trips from the date of taking office to the end of last year.  These visits included engagements with business communities, the Diaspora, the local media as well as with my counterparts and key political figures with the sole objective of repairing our reputation with our partners, advancing our interests and strengthening our relations across the full range of the Department&rsquo;s objectives.  In addition to these bilateral visits, I also represented the Government at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius.  Not only was this Summit significant, given that Ireland was in the OSCE Chairmanship in Office Trio, but it was also the Forum at which negotiations on an EU Association Agreement with Ukraine collapsed.  Events have since demonstrated how pivotal that moment has been.  I also represented the Government at the 11<sup>th<\/sup> Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in New Delhi, during which, in addition to advancing our positions at the Plenary, I held a number of bilateral discussions with our partners in Asia. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Government clearly recognises the importance of the European Parliament in EU decision making and has committed to Ministerial attendance at as many Plenary Sessions as is practical.  In this regard, I attended a Plenary Session in the second half of last year.  These overseas travel costs came to &euro;11, 919 in 2013.<\/p><p>  During the EU Presidency, it was necessary for the T&aacute;naiste to travel to Brussels and Luxembourg on a regular basis.  The programme for the visits to Brussels and Luxembourg usually involved back-to-back monthly meetings of the General Affairs Council, which he chaired for the duration of the Presidency, and the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC).  He also represented the Council at key political level meetings with the European Parliament and the European Commission in relation to the EU Budget for the period 2014-2020.  After intensive negotiations, agreement on the EU budget was reached in the final days of June, and was widely regarded as a major achievement of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  During this period, the T&aacute;naiste also substituted for High Representative Catherine Ashton on seven occasions in which he either chaired or participated in meetings.  This included four engagements at the European Parliament - three debriefs to the Foreign Affairs Committee on the outcome of the FAC and one address to the European Parliament - as well as an address to the Human Rights Council in Geneva.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scottish Referendum","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA04550"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[15253\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300050#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has examined the policy implications for Ireland of a \"Yes\" vote in the Scottish independence referendum; if he will support Scotland's application for membership of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Ireland's aid programme has always had a strong poverty focus and the new development policy &quot;One World One Future&quot; will strengthen that focus and adjust it to the changing context in developing countries.  Our aid programme is recognised internationally as one of the most effective in reaching the poorest.<\/p><p>  Ireland directs the greater part of its assistance to some of the neediest countries in the world.  Approximately 80% of our bilateral assistance goes to Least Developed and Low Income countries and to Africa.  Programmes funded with this aid are designed and monitored to ensure that our support reaches the intended beneficiaries.  They are appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability and cost effectiveness.  The programmes are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts, as well as by my Department's Evaluation and Audit Unit.<\/p><p>  Robust accountability systems in Partner Countries are essential to ensuring that development assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries.  Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of these systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance.  Our own management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.<\/p><p>  Multilateral organisations play a vital role in building international agreement on key development challenges, and work in areas where needs are the greatest.  These include regions and countries experiencing greater degrees of hunger, fragility and instability, because of conflict, disaster or the harmful effects of climate change.  &quot;One World One Future&quot; reaffirms Ireland's strong support for multilateral efforts in the fight against global poverty and hunger. <\/p><p>  We ensure that our assistance through multilateral agencies has a strong poverty focus by directing our support through organizations and agencies such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF, UNHCR, the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Development Programme, that have a particular focus on the poorest countries or situations of greatest need.  Ireland's development policy also recognises that meeting the greatest needs calls for protecting and fulfilling the rights of people, particularly the most marginalised, and calls for the promotion of human rights in our development efforts.  Irish Aid uses its multilateral programme to further these issues.  For example UNICEF, for example, has mainstreamed equity across its work, to ensure that all   children, particularly the most marginalised, have access to education, health care, sanitation, clean water, protection and other services necessary for their survival, growth and development.<\/p><p>  To ensure that our assistance is targeted at those most in need and delivered in the most effective manner we work through a variety of bilateral and other aid delivery channels in partnership with national authorities, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations.  This mix of aid modalities and delivery channels that we use globally and in our Partner Countries means that, despite the changing and sometimes challenging contexts where we have to work, we do have the partnerships and channels to ensure that our aid reaches the very poorest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300051#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300051#WRB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[15894\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300051#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which commitments entered into by the international community have been delivered to specific areas following major disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes in the Philippines, Haiti and other such areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve the scale and effectiveness of the response of the international community to major disasters and humanitarian crises.  Many lessons have been learned from previous crises such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible. Ireland has been playing our part in ensuring these reforms are implemented, so that responses are timely and effective, and meet the most critical, immediate needs.<\/p><p>  Two months after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake, an international donor conference was held in New York, at which US $4.5 billion worth of assistance over two years was pledged by the international community in response to the crisis.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2012, just $2.38 billion of this had actually been disbursed.  For our part, we worked hard to meet Ireland's commitments to the people of Haiti.  By the end of 2012, our pledge of &euro;13 million had been honoured and exceeded, with support totalling almost &euro;14 million. <\/p><p>  At the UN in New York in September 2011, the T&aacute;naiste pledged that &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance would be made available to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the Horn of Africa before the end of 2012.  I am happy to report that this pledge has also been met, with almost &euro;12 million in funding provided by December 2012.  Similarly, at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013, I announced a commitment of &euro;4.7 million to support the provision of humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries.  By the end of 2013, this pledge had been exceeded by over &euro;6.5 million, with a total of &euro;11.3 million in assistance provided throughout the course of the year.<\/p><p>  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees I attended the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014 where I announced Ireland's pledge of &euro;12 million in support to the humanitarian relief effort for 2014.  This additional pledge in Kuwait brings our overall funding commitment from 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million.  The UN has requested US$ 6.5 billion in response to the crisis in Syria for 2014 which is 15% funded to date.<\/p><p>  Even though no official pledging conference took place in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in November 2014, according to the UN's Financial Tracking Service, as of 31 March 2014 almost US$790 million has been contributed to the response by the international community and a further US$413 million has been pledged but not yet committed.  <\/p><p>Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to this natural disaster and our contribution to date stands at over &euro;4 million.  The Government also authorised the deployment of a technical mission to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process.  The recommendations from this technical mission include provision of additional funding of &euro;3 million for the recovery phase, which I pledged during my recent visit to Tacloban in the Philippines.  With this new commitment, Ireland's total humanitarian funding response to Typhoon Haiyan will exceed &euro;7 million.<\/p><p>  In order to promote the importance of ensuring that donor aid pledges are credible, achievable, and properly monitored, the OECD has published a &quot;Recommendation on Good Pledging Practice&quot;.  This comprises a set of principles relating to pledging practice for financial undertakings to developing countries and is designed to serve as a benchmark to help OECD Member States frame future aid pledges in terms that are clear, practical, realistic, and capable of being monitored.  Ireland has a proud record of meeting our pledges and strongly supports this OECD initiative and will continue to use all appropriate fora to urge our fellow donors to ensure that they meet their humanitarian commitments in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300051#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Enlargement","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[15895\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the EU remains focused on the issues affecting the Western Balkans with particular reference to the need to ensure the future of the democratic process and compliance with the acquis communautaire; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The specific issues mentioned by the Deputy are of particular concern. Limiting illicit flows of arms to regions of tension or conflict is an ongoing priority and in some instances restrictions have been markedly successful.  The Arms Trade Treaty, ATT, was approved by the General Assembly on 2 April 2013 and has been signed by 118 states so far, including Ireland and all other EU Member States.  Ireland formally completed its ratification of the ATT yesterday, 2 April, along with sixteen other EU Member States and El Salvador, bringing the total number of ratifications to 31; the Treaty's entry into force will be triggered when 50 states have ratified it, possibly within this year.  The ATT establishes a set of rules to govern the international arms trade and its terms prohibit the sale of arms which might be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law or acts of gender-based violence.  Its comprehensive implementation will result in a significant change in the way the arms trade is conducted and will make transfers to locations affected by conflict and violence considerably more difficult.<\/p><p>  Ireland is fully committed to implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and related resolutions on women, peace and security, which recognise the particular impact conflict has on women and girls, and the important role played by women in building and sustaining peace, through a National Action Plan 2011-2014.  Ireland has engaged on the issue of Children and Armed Conflict in various ways including, crucially, through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development &ndash; major root causes of this problem.  Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific interventions from supporting agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, to designing interventions in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict.  Ireland also recently made a statement highlighting our concerns in relation to children and armed conflict during an interactive debate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms Leila Zerrougui, at the Human Rights Council session which took place in March 2014.  Furthermore, Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello TD, spoke of the continuing need to tackle the issue of child soldiers in conflicts in Africa and other regions at the EU-Africa Ministerial meeting on 1st April ahead of the 4th EU-Africa Summit.<\/p><p>  We remain deeply committed to addressing this issue, as has been recently reflected in Ireland's new Policy for International Development, 'One World, One Future', where we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict. We are examining options for strengthened action in this area. <\/p><p>  Human rights concerns are central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. <\/p><p>  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015. <\/p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have also been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.

As the various payment rates are fixed, vouched expenditure is not required under the regulations.\u00a0 All claims, however, must be approved and sanctioned by a superior officer to the claimant.\u00a0 In addition, approved claims are subject to spot-checking prior to payment by Revenue's Accountant General's Branch in Ennis.<\/p><p>  Official Vehicles<\/p><p>  The care, management and usage of official vehicles are covered by detailed &quot;Revenue Operational Instructions&quot;.\u00a0 Official vehicles are allocated by Revenue for the use of authorised officers on official activities and may only be driven by officials who hold full current unendorsed driving licences. As a matter of good practice, they are not intended to be used as substitutes for private cars for such routine purposes as attending meetings or serving on Interview Boards, particularly where this use would make them unavailable for the activities for which they were acquired.\u00a0 Official vehicles are vital resources which are in constant use by our uniformed enforcement staff when conducting enforcement operations, roadside checkpoints, surveillance work etc.<\/p><p>  Seized Vehicles<\/p><p>  The use of seized vehicles as official vehicles is not permitted except in very exceptional circumstances.  The absence of reliable service records for such vehicles would cast doubts as to their safety and the use of such vehicles could expose the Commissioners to claims for compensation in the event of an accident or incident.<\/p><p>  Interview Boards<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners take great care to ensure that Interview Boards are fair and impartial.\u00a0 The composition of Interview Boards must take account of gender balance as well as experience, backgrounds, the position(s) being interviewed for and the geographical spread of candidates. Otherwise, perceptions of unfairness can arise and the integrity of promotion or recruitment competitions undermined and exposed to challenge. Consequently, it is prudent not to confine the selection of interviewers to Dublin.\u00a0 Furthermore since Revenue is quite a geographically dispersed organisation, as a matter of good practice interview boards are often held where the posts are or where the candidates are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme Administration","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[15815\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on further ways of stimulating activity in the construction industry by improving incentives to engage in construction projects large and small; if the home renovation incentive scheme is showing any signs of job creation and-or support; his views on whether further incentives would be an effective way to complement the allocation of funding towards capital projects as a means of creating and sustaining jobs in construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals. In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted. <\/p><p>  Where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority, and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property. Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed. The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme. The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property. It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[15730\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300052#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a person now in their 60s who was informally adopted during the early months of their life, cared for and raised by an aunt and her husband who have now died and left the family home-estate to them; the way problems which are now arising in relation to probate and taxation can be rectified (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Based on the information provided by the Deputy the taxpayer in question may be eligible for this relief.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for Foster Child Relief the following conditions must be met:<\/p><p>  -  For formally fostered: Where the inheritance is taken by a beneficiary on the date of death of the disponer, that the beneficiary had, prior to the date of inheritance been placed in the foster care of the disponer under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulation 1995 (SI No 260 of 1995) or the Child Care (Placement of Children\u00a0 with Relatives) Regulation 1995 (SI No 261 of 1995), or<\/p><p>  -  For informally fostered:\u00a0 Where a beneficiary throughout a period or periods of at least 5 years within the first 18 years after the beneficiary's birth \u00a0(i) has resided with the disponer and\u00a0(ii) was under the care of and maintained by the disponer, at the disponer's own expense.<\/p><p>  -  The relief applies where the claim for the relief is verified by the testimony of at least two witnesses.<\/p><p>  Where the beneficiary meets the eligibility required to claim the Foster Child Relief, then, for the purposes of computing the Capital Acquisitions Tax payable on their inheritance, that beneficiary is deemed to be a &quot;child&quot; of that disponer and, consequently will qualify for the relief threshold applicable in the case of an inheritance by a son or daughter of the disponer, namely &euro;225,000.<\/p><p>  In order to apply for the relief the taxpayer must file a self assessed inheritance tax return through Revenue's on-line ROS system. Full details on how to file an inheritance tax return is provided on the Revenue website .

In this regard Permanent TSB prepared a\u00a0Restructuring Plan, which the Department of Finance submitted to the European Commission (\"the Commission\") in June 2012.  As requested by the Commission an updated version of the plan was submitted in August 2013 which is broadly in line with the June 2012 plan.  Discussions are ongoing at a technical level involving the Commission, the Department of Finance and Permanent TSB in relation to the plan, details of which are confidential between the parties and commercially sensitive. I do not intend to speculate on when that process might be concluded.<\/p><p>   As the Deputy will be aware Permanent TSB is not alone in seeking such approval.  I am also seeking approval from the European Commission for the\u00a0Restructuring Plan submitted by AIB.  While no plan has been approved,\u00a0Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the\u00a0Restructuring Plan\u00a0submitted\u00a0over the last year and the business is being managed structurally\u00a0in the way envisaged in the plan.  Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>  During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it\u00a0launched several new products during the year.  I am advised that Permanent TSB paid out over &euro;200m in mortgage lending in 2013 and that it had a market share of retail deposits of c 13%.  As a result of the progress made during 2013 Permanent\u00a0TSB is now a genuine and important competitor in the retail banking market.<\/p><p>  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears and has created a dedicated team to deal with those\u00a0customers\u00a0and to roll out various solutions to them.  I am advised by Permanent TSB that during\u00a02013 it made approximately 18,000\u00a0offers of long term\u00a0sustainable solutions\u00a0to customers in arrears or having\u00a0difficulty with their mortgage repayments.  The\u00a0current strategy\u00a0is for Permanent\u00a0TSB to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail \u00a0banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[15946\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank of Ireland plans to progress the investigation into the mis-selling of payment protection insurance policies; the number of policies that have been reviewed at this point in time; how far back the review covers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>On 7 March 2014, the Central Bank of Ireland issued a report on the review into the sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) by eleven credit institutions.

During this process, QQI has prioritised the development of those policies required to allow new applications from providers who wish to have access to the awards of QQI, and those policies were published in October.  QQI will continue to roll out its remaining policies over the coming months.<\/p><p>  The operation of ACELS will be discontinued by QQI when its policies relating to the Code of Practice for the provision of education to international learners, and the related International Education Mark (IEM), are established.  The Code of Practice and IEM will place the recognition and monitoring of the English Language sector by QQI on a statutory footing. QQI intends to publish its draft policy on international education for consultation in the summer, with the final policy being rolled-out in the second half of 2014.<\/p><p>  Given the expected timeframe for their establishment, QQI decided to re-open access to ACELS recognition for a temporary period until 31 January 2014, to accommodate those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) which were ready to apply and which had expressed an interest in gaining recognition for 2014.  Since that date QQI's focus has turned to the processing of those final applications and the transition to the new Code of Practice\/IEM regime.  Once in place, recognition of ELTOs by QQI will only be granted in the context of the Code of Practice and the International Education Mark.  However, it should be noted that ACELS recognised ELTOs will not have an automatic entitlement to use the International Education Mark, but will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code of Practice and related policies.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that &quot;accreditation&quot; in this context does not relate to the making of awards by QQI.  Instead, it simply refers to recognition of the providers concerned by QQI, which means they have demonstrated compliance with ACELS standards and are subject to ongoing monitoring and review by QQI to ensure their ongoing compliance.  There is no mandatory regulation of the English language sector in Ireland and therefore providers are not required to have ACELS recognition in order to operate in the State.  Indeed, many ELTOs choose to operate without such recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[15722\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300054#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the efforts being made to increase the number of ASD places in mainstream secondary schools in Dublin south; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.

South Dublin County Council (SDCC) will take the proposals forward through planning and eventual construction.  The Council is currently reviewing the Options Report and it is hoped that the procurement of consultants to undertake the necessary Part 8 Planning and detailed design will be commenced shortly.  Once consultants have been appointed a comprehensive programme to take a scheme through construction and an estimate of the associated cost will be developed by the Council.  In addition to flood attenuation, the Scheme may involve some downstream defence works.<\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has given a commitment in principle to the Scheme and has made indicative provision for its cost in its Multi-Annual Capital Budget Profiles for the period 2014-2017.  However, construction of the Scheme will be dependent on successful completion of the planning process and the availability of funding at the point when the Scheme is ready to be undertaken.<\/p><p>  The OPW understands that the works carried out so far by SDCC  have significantly alleviated flood risk in the area but it is not possible to state to what level of flood risk these works protect against.  New screens have been placed on the Poddle, with regular cleaning of these screens being undertaken by the Council.  Remote monitoring of two of these screens is also taking place, which allows the Council to react swiftly to any noticeable problem.  In addition, the river bed and banks have been cleaned from Tymon Park to Kimmage Manor and down to Kimmage Road West, which has led to improved flood flow.  However, properties will still be at risk until the scheme is undertaken, and the Council is aware of the need to continue with regular maintenance and monitoring in the interim period. <\/p><p>  As indicated already, the Council is not in a position yet to confirm when works will be undertaken on the scheme.  However, when the works are completed the details will be provided to the insurance industry in accordance with the recently agreed Memorandum of Understanding which covers completed flood defence schemes.  The scheme will provide protection against a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in a given year, commonly referred to as a 100 year flood event.  This should lead to residents being able to avail of flood cover again, although the provision of cover in any case will remain a matter for the insurance companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300056#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Services","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300056#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[15743\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300056#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the duration of the merchant agreement where payment by debit or credit card is accepted for services provided by his Department or bodies under the aegis of his Department to the public; when the term of the agreement will end; if the merchant agreement is awarded by way of tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The CEBs support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  They are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on . <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created.  This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth. The CEBs will be legally dissolved and the LEOs formally launched later this month.<\/p><p>  Currently, the CEBs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises are ineligible for direct financial support from the CEBs due to concerns over displacement (where grant-assisted projects simply displace business from other players in the local market). <\/p><p>  When established, the LEOs will become the first-stop-shop through which information on national and local supports for business can be accessed, where new start-up and micro-enterprises can be grant-aided, where small businesses can receive training and mentoring, and where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p><p>  However, anyone setting up or operating a business can benefit from participating in the CEB\/LEO non-financial or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; support programmes.  All locally trading businesses, including start-ups, can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB\/LEO in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, etc.  Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business (SYOB), taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. <\/p><p>  In addition, any start-up can use the CEBs\/LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB\/LEO.

Shorelines absorb the energy entering the coastal zone by redistributing sediment.  Material that is eroded from one section of the coast accumulates in another, such that the contours of the coastline are constantly in a state of change.  Interference with these natural dynamic processes (by trying to slow down or stop them) can sometimes invite further instability and increased rates of damage to land and property in the area concerned.  The construction of physical barriers such as sea defences can interrupt longshore drift, leading to beach starvation and increased rates of erosion in adjacent areas.  Therefore, care must be taken to consider fully the effects of any response to erosional events.  Erosion can also be exacerbated by human impacts and this also needs to be taken into account.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Machair is a priority habitat and is listed as a qualifying interest for the Slyne Head Peninsula Special Area of Conservation (site code: 2074). <\/p><p>  Constant cycles of erosion and stabilisation are considered part of a naturally functioning dune\/machair system.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and    <\/p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.<\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles.  Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by measures in the National Digital Strategy which I launched in July last.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy targets specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital engagement of citizens and businesses to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300060#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300061#WRM00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dormant Accounts Fund Administration","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300061#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[15810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300061#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a specific breakdown, in tabular form on a county basis, of where the Dormant Accounts Fund was spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The penalty for nonconformance with these requirements is a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to three months, or both. The statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the relevant legislation rests with the local authorities whose dog control staff work on enforcement on an on-going basis.   <\/p><p>The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 (as amended) set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that their dogs must be muzzled, leashed and led by a competent person over 16 years of age when in public.

More recently a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units. The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years.   <\/p><p>  Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto<\/i> owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.

The main component of these gases is water vapour.  Ambient air temperature at jet cruising altitudes is often below -50<sup>0<\/sup> C.  Under these conditions, water vapour cools and condenses and the particles act as ice nuclei, leading to the production of ice crystals; these ice crystals are what are visible from the ground as a linear cloud of condensation. <\/p><p>  Depending upon atmospheric conditions, contrails can rapidly dissipate or remain for some time, gradually spreading horizontally into an extensive thin cirrus cloud layer. Water in the atmosphere commonly evaporates to become water vapour.  As a general rule, the drier the air the more effective this evaporation process will be. Under more humid conditions, there will be less effective evaporation and so contrails will generally last longer in more humid air.  Contrail formation is also influenced by wind speeds, with higher winds disrupting and breaking up contrail formation.<\/p><p>  Contrails do not adversely impact ambient air quality in Ireland. Met &Eacute;ireann advises that there is some evidence that contrails can influence climatology but they have little impact on day-to-day weather. The purported reason for the former is that the contrails (or consequent cirrus cloud) will trap outgoing long-wave radiation, thus leading to warming in the atmosphere, and that this effect is greater than the reflection of short-wave radiation from the sun.  <\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is currently funding a PhD study on contrails and their potential effect on climate as part of its STRIVE research programme.

The numbers waiting as of the 1 April 2014 are detailed in the table below. In this context, it may interest the Deputy to know that the number of new applications received by the Legal Aid Board during the period April 2013 - March 2014 (inclusive) was in the order of 17,148.<\/p><p>  Demand in 2013 was at the same level as it was in 2012 and while there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board's grant-in-aid at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in growing numbers waiting for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. I know that waiting times are a matter of constant concern to the Board and that it keeps them under very active review. I am also aware that the Board is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board last year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.<\/p><p>  In September 2013 I signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. The Regulations include a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and they also include increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the resources available to the Board.<\/p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/p><p>- The Board has been piloting a 'triage' approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the 'triage' approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'. There is or has been a 'backlog' of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. Where the triage approach is operative there is a waiting time for the triage appointment and a waiting time for the second consultation. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved. <\/p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a 'start to end' system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.<\/p><p>- In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a 'litigation first' approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated. I know that the Board is working particularly hard on promoting mediation as a meaningful option.<\/p><p>- While the Board's asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single 'grant-in-aid'. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.<\/p><p>- I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.<\/p><p>- I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the HSE (now the Child and Family Agency), with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.<table><tr><th>Law Centre<\/th><th>Part-Time Centre<\/th><th>Numbers waiting for a first consultation<br \/><br \/>as of 1 April 2014<\/th><th>Numbers waiting for a second consultation as of 1 April 2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Athlone<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td>Mullingar<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td> -

This permission was renewed on a regular basis until 2010.  The person concerned applied to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to have his permission renewed prior to December 2010. His request was not processed due to concerns regarding his being part of a family unit.  However, following consideration and receipt of all requested documentation from the person concerned, my officials granted him a further period of twelve months permission to remain in the State from 9 May, 2012. <br \/><br \/>  The person concerned wrote to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department in April, 2013 to seek further permission to remain in the State. He was requested to provide up to date documentation regarding his family situation and finances by letter dated 22 May, 2013.  Some documentation was supplied by the person concerned but it was not considered sufficient.   Further documentation regarding the family situation of the person concerned was requested by letter dated 23 July, 2013. To date this additional documentation has not been received.  Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, the case of the person concerned will be examined by the relevant officials in the INIS and a decision communicated to him in due course. <br \/><br \/>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation has been received from the person concerned.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I am informed that this application is now at an advanced stage of processing and will be submitted to me for decision in due course.    <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Substantial change and reorganisation has been successfully carried out by the Defence Forces in the last three years. I am advised by the military authorities that the organisational changes have brought significant operational improvements to the PDF, thus ensuring that the Defence Forces organisational structures are configured to maximise capabilities. As such, the restructuring from a three to two Brigade structure, along with the closure of four barracks, removed the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations and freed up more personnel for operational front line duties. Larger formations allow for improved delivery of services and the continued maintenance of services required by Government. <\/p><p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Defence I have visited barracks regularly as the opportunities presented themselves.

","asker":"968","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>The market situation in the cattle sector is analysed and monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department and Bord Bia.  The young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to adversely affect demand.  The number of young bulls slaughtered to date in 2014, at over 69,000 head, is 4% ahead of the same period in 2013.  However, average prices for that type of animal are down significantly because there is an oversupply of young bulls that do not meet market requirements.<\/p><p>  The principal difficulty in marketing beef from young bulls older than 16 months of age is that these animals are deemed 'out of spec' by purchasers in the UK market.  The UK market, which accounted for 250,000 tonnes or 53% of Irish beef exports by volume in 2013, wants only in-spec animals &ndash; particularly steers.  The bulk of Irish beef exports to the UK are purchased by retail multiples which set out specific requirements as regards the product that they are willing to purchase.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Bord Bia that older bulls are less valuable to meat plants.  When such carcases are deboned, they do not have the option of selling any of the cuts into the UK retail sector. Bulls over 24 months of age are not considered as prime cattle and are classified by the EU as mature bulls.  There are, therefore, limited outlets for mature bull beef which, like that of cull cows, is primarily used for manufacturing and commands a low market value.<\/p><p>  Feedback received by Bord Bia from customers in various Continental markets consistently indicates that they highly value prime steer beef coming from grass-based production systems. Young bull beef is seen as more of a commodity and tends to sell for a lower price.  There will continue to be niches, in markets like Italy, where there is demand for a certain amount of young bull beef. However, Irish beef producers should be mindful that this is a specialised market for a restricted carcase specification and that it has become more price competitive in recent years.<\/p><p>  It is likely that more farmers will revert to traditional steer beef finishing because Irish steers are a unique selling point for our beef industry that enables us to achieve premium prices for that product. In the domestic cattle market, the relationship between processors and producers is a highly interdependent one.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers.  Current market conditions clearly highlight the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain.  An industry-led solution is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300067#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes Overpayments","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300067#WRS01750"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[15763\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300067#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason an overpayment of &euro;910.44 was assessed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the amount and the scheme years it relates to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>The overpayment was made up of &euro;767.14 REPS 4 and &euro;143.30 Single Payment\/Disadvantaged Area Scheme.

According to the study, Ireland rates first in terms of GDP share in all IPR-intensive industries in the EU, first for GDP share of copyright-intensive industries and, first for GDP share of trade mark-intensive industries.

This Government continues to focus on ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s intellectual property regime compares favourably with best international practice.

While no specific rare disease is mentioned, the council&rsquo;s decision declared that it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases; and it states that the specificities of rare diseases are: a limited number of patients and; a scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise.  The Council&rsquo;s decision recognised these specificities when it recommended that member states adopt a plan to guide actions in the general field of rare diseases. It is with this in mind that my Department is finalising a generic plan to apply to the 8,000 rare diseases estimated to exist, including Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.<\/p><p>  With respect to access to the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), the HSE processes applications on the basis that the treatment which the patient is being referred for is not available in Ireland.  The presence of a rare illness, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, is not of itself criteria for availing of treatment abroad: most rare diseases are treated without any need for recourse to services in other jurisdictions. All patients in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state.  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  Approved applicants\/patients&rsquo; hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode of care. Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant<\/p><p>  Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form.  It is not possible to give a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; statement on applications to TAS for patients with a particular condition.  As outlined above each application is reviewed individually based on the referral for treatment that is not available in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act, 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme. The conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.

Additionally Shannon Foynes Port Company has also\u00a0produced its own development masterplan entitled 'Vision 2041'. This plan was developed taking cognisance of, and is consistent with, the outputs of the Strategic Integrated Framework Plan.   The\u00a0Plan refers to the potential of the Estuary in developing as a transhipment hub and seeks to provide the policy framework to safeguard the critical deep-water channels and facilitate the sustainable growth of the required deep-water berths. The Plan also designates a total of nine strategic development locations for marine related industry and large scale industrial development around the Estuary as a whole. It is Government policy that all port infrastructure development must be funded on a commercial basis without recourse to the Exchequer; however, the Strategic Integrated Framework Plan is a good example of inter-Governmental co-operation designed to facilitate future sustainable economic growth and provides potential investors with\u00a0a clear vision of the Estuary's future potential. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Traffic Control Services","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[15812\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the potential in the development of Shannon as a European centre for air traffic control; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>The main objective of the EU Single European Sky initiative is to reform the air traffic management system in Europe, currently delivered by approximately 40 separate service providers, including the Irish Aviation Authority.\u00a0\u00a0   The European air traffic management system is a complex one with widely varying conditions across a network currently controlling some 9.5 million flights per year.

It is important to recognise that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have responsibility for the coordination of mountain rescue teams under the Framework for Major Emergency Management. The Garda&iacute; fall under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. However, my Department is responsible through the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) as Chair of the National Coordinating Committee for Mountain and Cave Rescue, for administering payment of grants to all the mountain rescue teams in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Over the past four years this grant funding scheme has provided &euro;362,957 to mountain rescue teams - see table below. In some instances organisations such as Mountain Rescue Ireland, the all-island umbrella organisation governing mountain rescue in Ireland,\u00a0can make applications to other Departments and agencies under various funding schemes. It is important that voluntary organisations that meet qualifying criteria can seek funding from a variety of sources. <\/p><p>  In terms of extra funding from my own Department, I have stated recently that I have asked my officials to consider the introduction of a modest capital grant scheme for mountain rescue activities. However, given constraints on my Department&rsquo;s overall capital budget and other capital demands arising from my primary responsibility to provide a marine emergency response, it will be some time later in the year before it can be established whether there is any capital funding that could be utilised for mountain rescue services.\u00a0<table><tr><th>Mountain Rescue Team<\/th><th>2011 &euro;<\/th><th>2012 &euro;<\/th><th>2013 &euro;<\/th><th>2014  &euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Mountain Rescue <\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin &amp;amp; Wicklow Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Glen of Imaal Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><td>14,815<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>\u00a0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo-Leitrim Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SARDA<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Eastern Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><td>7,407<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tramore Mountain Rescue<\/td><td>3,704<\/td><td>3,704<\/td><td>3,704<\/td><td>3,704<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Projects Funding","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[15908\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of money approved by his Department directly or through one of its agencies towards the development of the greenway along the route of the old Galway &ndash; Clifden railway line; when it is expected that the money will be spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>I have no direct role in relation to individual\u00a0tourism projects.\u00a0This is a\u00a0matter\u00a0for the board and management of\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly\u00a0I have referred the question to the agency for direct reply.\u00a0 Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[15936\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if work can be done to secure trees along a section of train track (details supplied) in County Kerry.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":769,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have referred the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040300074#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"}]
