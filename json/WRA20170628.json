In certain cases, the provision of carparking within large formally designed historic landscapes can be at odds with the sensitive management of such locations and can only be located where they do not create an adverse visual impact.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the\u00a0best value for money.\u00a0 It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour particular candidates on grounds such\u00a0as organisation size, locality, nationality etc., and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, there is a recognition at EU Level of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The new EU Directives on Procurement, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.\u00a0 Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:<\/p>  <p>  - financial capacity\u00a0criterion is generally\u00a0limited to twice contract value - there are no\u00a0centrally imposed\u00a0requirements for a minimum turnover.  Establishing the\u00a0appropriate\u00a0suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to\u00a0a\u00a0particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting\u00a0authority\u00a0\u00a0concerned.  This is because the contracting authority\u00a0is in the best\u00a0\u00a0position to gauge the appropriate levels of\u00a0financial capacity that are\u00a0appropriate to the needs of that specific\u00a0contract.<\/p>  <p>  - discretion to divide\u00a0public contracts\u00a0\u00a0into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a\u00a0contract into\u00a0lots must be explained in the procurement documents or the\u00a0report on the procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  - electronic methods of\u00a0communication are\u00a0mandated in parts of the tender process.<\/p>  <p>  - the introduction of the\u00a0European Single\u00a0Procurement Document (ESPD), a self-declaration form aimed\u00a0at reducing red tape for suppliers <\/p>  <p>  - provision for &ldquo;consortia\u00a0bidding&rdquo; may\u00a0assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where\u00a0they would\u00a0not have the relevant capability or scale if they were to bid\u00a0as sole tenderers <\/p>  <p>  - explicit provision for\u00a0pre-market\u00a0discussion with suppliers and independent experts, subject\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0safeguards against distorting competition or violating\u00a0transparency and\u00a0non-discrimination principles <\/p>  <p>  - reductions in the time\u00a0limits for receipt\u00a0of tenders by approximately 30% compared to the position under the 2006\u00a0Regulations <\/p>  <p>  - Member States are\u00a0required to report back\u00a0to the Commission every 3 years on SME\u00a0participation in public\u00a0procurement <\/p>  <p>  A number of these measures\u00a0had been\u00a0accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new Directives by Circular 10\/14 -\u00a0Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement - issued by the OGP.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.\u00a0 The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly. \u00a0It does this by facilitating\u00a0quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, which have been chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF)\u00a0can be heard by Government.\u00a0 SMEs are also encouraged to register with the Government's eTenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP\u00a0works\u00a0with\u00a0the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of\u00a0 Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the\u00a0engagement of SMEs in public procurement.\u00a0 Evidence of\u00a0the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in events such as\u00a0\"Go-2-Tender\"\u00a0workshops\u00a0and\u00a0\"Meet\u00a0the Buyer\" events.<\/p>  <p>  The data analysed by the OGP and published last September (2014 Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report) indicates that 95% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and the majority of\u00a0spend\u00a0analysed is with SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to proactively engage with\u00a0business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800077#WRD05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800078#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[30478\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800078#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will set out each side agreement reached with trade unions and staff associations during the recent talks that led to the draft public service agreement including for additional allowances, annual leave and higher pay rates;

Depending upon the negotiated terms of Brexit there may be future implications for Irish students studying in the UK.\u00a0 My Department is keeping this matter under constant review and it is my stated intention to seek to have the best outcome for our students. <\/p>  <p>  A principal concern of mine is to protect to the greatest extent possible student mobility between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the UK and within the EU and to support our strategy to increase non-EU student flows.\u00a0 I am particularly concerned to facilitate the continued feasibility of the UK as an option for our further and higher education students.<\/p>  <p>  With such issues in mind a key part of my approach has been to engage on Brexit-related matters at political and institutional level.  I have met my counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and recently met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening.  I also met the former Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain.  I have also had meetings with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission at which our priorities and concerns were raised.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Irish students currently studying in Higher Education Institutions in the UK and those planning to do so in the coming years, the UK Government have outlined that the EU referendum outcome and the triggering of Article 50 will not lead to any immediate change to the immigration status of current EU students, including those that are on courses in this academic year (2016&ndash;17).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It has also been outlined in separate statements from across all UK nations (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) that current university students from the EU and those applying to courses starting in 2017&ndash;18 will not see any changes to their loan eligibility or tuition fee status.  This position will apply for the full duration of the course, even if the course finishes after the UK has left the EU.\u00a0 For students looking to study in Scotland, this position has been extended to those enrolling for 2018&ndash;19.<\/p>  <p>  Separate statements from across all UK nations confirm that current EU students, including 2016&ndash;17 entrants, will remain eligible to receive loans and grants to fund their studies for the duration of their courses.<\/p>  <p>  EU students attending universities in England and Wales who are eligible under current rules to receive loans and grants from the Student Loans Company will continue to do so for the duration of courses they are currently enrolled on.  This has been confirmed by the Student Loans Company for England, and by Universities Wales for Wales. <\/p>  <p>  Under EU law, students from EU member states applying for undergraduate degrees at Scottish universities are currently eligible for free tuition.  For EU students attending a university in Scotland, the Scottish government and Universities Scotland have confirmed that there has been no change in current funding arrangements.  This means that eligible EU students already studying in Scotland, including those that commenced their studies the current academic year (2016&ndash;17) will continue to benefit from free tuition and, for those who meet the residency requirement, associated living cost support.<\/p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, the Department for the Economy has issued a statement confirming that EU nationals who are currently receiving student loans from Student Finance Northern Ireland, including those that started courses last autumn (in the 2016&ndash;17 academic year) will continue to receive these loans and grants until they finish their course.<\/p>  <p>  The following is the position for\u00a0EU students applying for a course starting in 2017&ndash;18:<\/p>  <p>  - In England: The Government has outlined that EU students applying to start a course in England in 2017&ndash;18 will continue to be eligible for tuition fee loans and for 'home' fee status for the duration of their study.<\/p>  <p>  - In Wales: The Education Secretary has announced that EU nationals who intend to begin studying in the academic year 2017&ndash;18 will also continue to receive financial support.<\/p>  <p>  - It has also been confirmed in a statement from the Scottish Government that students starting courses in 2017 at universities in Scotland will continue to receive free tuition and other support for the full duration of their course.<\/p>  <p>  - Similar announcements have been made in respect of EU students applying to universities in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 Student Finance Northern Ireland has said that EU nationals currently in higher education and those who intend to begin studying from 2017 who are assessed as eligible to receive \u00a0loans and\/or grants, will continue to receive these until they finish \u00a0their course. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0EU students applying for a PhD starting in 2017-18:<\/p>  <p>  It has been confirmed by the UK Government that EU nationals starting courses in the next academic year (2017-18) will continue to be eligible for Research Council PhD studentships to help fund their studies for the full duration of their course.

technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0010\/2013.\u00a0 All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools, as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and reasonable accommodations in State Examinations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members

The Fund is allocated annually to the universities, the institutes of technology, the colleges of education and a number of other higher education institutions.

This report is a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties in higher education in Ireland and a mapping of best practices in supporting these students.  The report found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  It also found that students were generally positive about their experience of these services.  Some key recommendations from the report were: <\/p>  <p>  - A whole of campus strategic response is required to meet the needs of students with mental health difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  - The promotion of mental health awareness should be as part of induction for students.<\/p>  <p>  - The provision of mental health awareness training at an institutional level for academic and all other staff including part-time\/adjunct staff.<\/p>  <p>  - A move towards a flexible approach to teaching across programmes to bring greater flexibility to learning and assessment to improve access for all students. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference\/seminar is planned for later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities <\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities allocates funding to further and higher education colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities from PLC up to doctoral level.

I used this opportunity, as well as my participation in the GAC (Art. 50), to acknowledge the support of our partners in agreeing to the inclusion in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position of elements addressing the particular challenges faced by Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[30510\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Israeli Government Ministers have called for an increase in the number of illegal Israeli settlers in the occupied Syrian Golan by 100,000 over a five year period; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that in 2016 the Israeli Government approved the construction of 1,600 new illegal colonial settlement units in the Golan; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that due to discriminatory housing policies, Syrians are forced to build without permits risking fines and the full or partial demolition of the building in order to meet their housing needs (details supplied); if he will raise this issue with the Israeli Government; and the steps he is taking to ensure that the EU is raising these and related issues with the Israeli Government through its current political dialogue and will do so during the EU Israel Association Council meeting if it takes place later in 2017.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>In the occupied Syrian Golan, as in the West Bank, the introduction and settlement of communities of the occupying power, to alter the demography of the area, is clearly illegal under international law.

The amendment means that community sports clubs are now only liable for rates on buildings or part of buildings that are used for the generation of income.  The position now is that buildings that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets etc. will be rated but buildings that are used purely for community sport will be exempt such as team dressing rooms, referees room, administrative offices and machine and equipment stores.  This change in the legislation was widely welcomed as it has brought greater equity and clarity to the sporting sector.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the treatment of other community organisations under the valuation legislation, the position is that Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001 also provides for the exemption from rates of community halls which are used by community-based and not for profit organisations such as theatre and drama groups.

In addition, monies secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund supported the establishment of ten new projects in the period 2015\/2016.<\/p><p>A table setting out the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects by county in each of the years 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017 follows.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>105<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Certificates","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[30395\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the process a person must undertake to correct the nationality on a certificate of naturalisation that they were issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that if a person believes that an error has occurred in the details recorded on a certificate of naturalisation, it is open to the person concerned to contact Citizenship Division (details available at www.inis.gov.ie) who will examine the case and advise on any procedure to be followed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[30473\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800080#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of vacancies for revenue sheriffs and the locations of same, in tabular form; the date on which the positions became vacant; if the positions have been advertised; if so, the closing dates for applications; if recommendations have been made with regard to appointments; and if so, the dates on which such recommendations were made.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that there is currently only one Revenue Sheriff post vacant, that of the Revenue Sheriff for County Mayo.

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

The HSE Mental Health Division has prioritised the provision of seven-day services as a key priority for 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Division&rsquo;s first priority is to ensure that all areas provide access to a weekend service for people currently attending the service.  In recognition of this, it set up a Service Improvement Project with a dedicated Project Manager resource in November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This project is focused on a more detailed mapping of current provision at weekends and extended hours including uptake of the service.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Division is also examining other options such as a phone helpline for people who are attending or have attended the Specialist Mental Health Services in the past.  This would enable people in need of advice to obtain this immediately from a mental health professional. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2017, HSE presented proposals for the extension of seven day Mental Health services coverage to Minister McEntee.  This included identification of gaps in the current service.  HSE advised that the extension would take the form of extra staff being added to existing Mental Health teams to facilitate increased out-of-hours coverage.  This plan is currently being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2016, around &euro;115 million was added to the HSE Mental Health Budget.  This is a significant increase and the Government is strongly committed to further increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to CAMHs and adult services, older people's mental health services and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates, bringing the total budget to over &euro;850 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800081#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800081#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[30247\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800081#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure the drug Respreeza continues to be made available for persons suffering from genetic emphysema;

Within this mix of options, grants and premiums are deliberately favoured towards broadleaves.  For example, the native woodland categories receive the highest level of grant and premium available. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Within areas planted with Sitka spruce (typically under Grant\u00a0and Premium Category 3(GPC3)), various rules apply to mitigate any environmental impact and promote positive attributes.  For example, such areas require a 10% additional broadleaf requirement, whereby native trees are positioned alongside public roads, along water setbacks and visible landscape edges, to soften any negative impact.  Afforestation within GPC3 is subject to adherence\u00a0to a wide range of measures, ranging from checks regarding protected habitats and species, to required setbacks along public roads, dwellings, watercourses and archaeological sites, to requirements regarding drainage and cultivation, fertiliser application, to contingency planning. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, any application for planting under GPC3 is subject to the requirements under the Forestry Regulations SI191 of 2017, whereby a full assessment is required by the Forest Service.  This assessment includes evaluation by a professional forester, referral to third parties such as NPWS, Inland Fisheries Ireland and local authorities, the application of Appropriate Assessment and EIA screening, and public consultation.

Section 7 provides for the\u00a0attachment and varying of conditions to a licence or\u00a0approval and also for the\u00a0revocation of a licence. Sections 26-29 set out a range of penalties that can be imposed.  These sections of the Act provide flexibility to the Minister in terms of attaching environmental conditions to an approval or licence and enforcing those conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Together, the above provisions are designed to integrate the protection of the environment and legal requirements under various relevant Directives and transposing legislation, into the central decision-making process regarding licences, approvals and grants by the Department.  This is reflected in the scope of the Act, as follows; &ldquo;.... to make further and better provision in relation to forestry, to provide for the development and promotion of forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests within the principles of sustainable forest management,....&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, the new Environmental Requirements for Afforestation document was introduced in December 2016.  This document consolidated relevant environmental safeguards into a single coherent document dealing exclusively with afforestation, taking onboard more recent developments in relation to regulation, research and changes in forest practices.  This document includes specific measures to ensure the protection of water quality when establishing new forests such as the introduction of new water features requiring setbacks. <\/p>  <p>  The commitment of my Department to protecting and enhancing water quality and aquatic life is demonstrated by: (i) its operation of the Native Woodland Scheme, which includes a strong focus on the use of native woodland, both new and existing, in this regard; (ii) the Woodland for Water model; and (iii) the Felling and Reforestation Policy, which sets out measures that are available to ensure that forests are appropriately restructured post-clearfell, to reflect water and other environmental sensitivities on-the-ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800084#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Management","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800084#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[30455\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800084#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider making commercial forestry plantations here subject to independent oversight by An Taisce, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department's Afforestation Grant\u00a0and Premium Scheme includes a number of measures that ensure that afforestation is carried out on appropriate sites, and that any environmental considerations that might exist are taken into account.  Where specific environmental considerations are identified, the application is simultaneously referred to one or more statutory consultees, primarily the National Parks\u00a0and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Inland Fisheries Ireland, the relevant Local Authority and An Taisce.  Comments submitted by statutory consultees are subsequently considered by the Forest Service of my Department when making a decision regarding whether or not to seek further information, to approve the application (typically with specific conditions), or to refuse it.  Furthermore, under\u00a0the European Union Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas,<b><\/b>afforestation applications in NATURA 2000 sites must be agreed with the relevant authority -\u00a0in Ireland this is the NPWS.<\/p><p>Apart from consultation with statutory consultees, the licensing process regarding the establishment of any new forest is subject to other rigorous checks and balances and undergoes careful planning and assessment by professional foresters.  For example, the Forest Service implements Appropriate Assessment Screening, as required under the Habitats Directive, to consider if a new afforestation application has the potential to significantly impact on a qualifying interest of a NATURA site (i.e. an SAC or SPA).  Where there is a possibility of this, or where uncertainty exists, the Forest Service seeks a NATURA Impact Statement and subsequently undertakes Appropriate Assessment, to either rule out the potential of a significant impact, or to identify appropriate mitigation measures that will eliminate any risk.<\/p><p>Notice of all applications for afforestation is placed on\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s website, showing townland, area of the site, etc.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, site notices are now required at the proposed entrance to the site in accordance with the new Forestry Act, and submissions from members of the public are considered during the decision-making process.<\/p><p>Furthermore, all new forests must be established in compliance with national and EU legislation and the Department&rsquo;s requirements as set out in the Forestry Standards Manual, Scheme Documents, Code of Best Practice &ndash; Ireland and the suite of environmental guidelines, including the new Environmental Requirements for Afforestation.

Transport Infrastructure Ireland have developed guidelines for Rural Cycle Scheme Design: these guidelines also reference Greenways.  Projects funded by this Department must comply with these guidelines, or in the case of urban based greenways, with the Cycle Manual and the Design\u00a0Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS).  These designs include a requirement to have the gradient of the Greenway limited to 5% and are thus suitable for cyclists but also\u00a0make for\u00a0very attractive walking routes.<\/p>  <p>  The experience on completed Greenways is that near towns and villages pedestrians significantly outnumber cyclists, by up to\u00a0a factor of 2 to 1, whilst on the more remote sections these figures reverse and cyclists outnumber pedestrians to the same degree.  The great strengths of Greenways are that they are multi-functional and provide access for all. Most Greenways are suitable for those in wheelchairs and pushing buggies and prams.<\/p>  <p>  Signage on both the Waterford Greenway and the Old Rail Trail in County Westmeath has a code of conduct for all users that should be heeded.  The importance of sharing the route with all users is emphasised and use of a bell by cyclists to alert pedestrians to their presence is recommended.

Expansion of ECCE was also given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach.<\/p>  <p>  The initial Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme had one entry point (September) from when children could begin pre-school, and children had to be aged between 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months by the September to avail of the free pre-school year (i.e. 38 weeks).  The programme was then expanded beginning in September 2016 by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  <\/p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the free pre-school programme is set at 5 years and 6 months, meaning that if a child is going to be older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of a pre-school year (i.e. end of June) they are not eligible to avail of free pre-school in that year.  This upper age limit was set in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills to comply with legislation relating to the age range of children beginning primary school and to ensure that children transition into primary school with their peers.  Therefore the maximum number of free pre-school weeks to which a child is entitled depends on their date of birth, and the age at which they start primary school.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, a significant increase on the previous provision of 38 weeks.  It is estimated that access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE reduces the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child. <\/p>  <p>  The eligibility for ECCE from age three using multiple entry points was also a recommendation in Right from the Start, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy, published in 2013.  The objective of this recommendation was to ensure that all children could access free pre-school from as near as possible after their third birthday until they started primary school.  This would ensure that children and families had access to care and education in these formative years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as is possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application.  An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800086#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Orders","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800086#WRN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[30393\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800086#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of applications for full care orders that have been made in respect of children already in voluntary care orders in each of the past seven years.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>I am unable to provide the Deputy with the information requested.

This figure has risen every year since and now stands at just under 36,000, with 60% of parents also getting carers allowance in respect of their child.  All parents in receipt of DCA also receive the annual carers support grant in June each year.  Recently, eligibility to the medical card was extended to all children in receipt of the allowance.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the operation of the DCA scheme was undertaken in 2012, and lead to the introduction of a revised application process with a revised application form which has increased the percentage of applications that are awarded initially to over 75%, significantly more than before the application processes were revised in 2013.  Eligibility can be more easily established if the application form is fully completed and any supporting documentation is provided with the initial application.  The numbers of applications referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office has reduced in recent years and while the percentage allowed on appeal is significant, this is due in many cases to new information being presented at appeal which was not previously available. <\/p>  <p>  Processing times for DCA are currently not meeting the target of having 70% of applications processed within 15 weeks.  Currently it is taking up to 18 weeks on average to finalise an application.  This is due to a number of factors.  <\/p>  <p>  First, there has been a significant increase in the volume of applications.  The numbers applying for DCA have doubled since 2010, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The increase in volume over recent years has been consistently in the 15-20% range per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, following a high court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the current situation, additional deciding officers are being assigned to the scheme and will take up their positions shortly.

The income limits under the\u00a01999\u00a0Scheme were revised on a number of occasions and in 2010 the annual income limit for a single income household was &euro;40,000, while the annual limit for a two income household was\u00a0&euro;100,000, using the formula of 2&frac12; times the main income plus once the secondary income.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants for affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000\u00a0satisfied the income eligibility requirement if the mortgage repayments for suitable accommodation available in the market would exceed 35% of their net income.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the\u00a0 housing affordability pressures in certain areas and is determined to see\u00a0 increases in the supply of\u00a0high quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, as quickly as possible, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.  This is one of the issues I will be considering in the context of the recently announced\u00a0\u00a0review of Rebuilding Ireland,\u00a0one year\u00a0on from its\u00a0publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made,\u00a0strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the review process,\u00a0my Department will focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability, building on the measures already being advanced.  In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.<\/p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing\u00a0and utilising State lands to deliver\u00a0housing\u00a0and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in\u00a0public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will\u00a0mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0also commits to\u00a0the\u00a0introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.\u00a0 Lands held by local authorities in\u00a0such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.<\/p>  <p>  The question of\u00a0the\u00a0criteria to apply\u00a0to determine eligibility for\u00a0affordable\u00a0units is currently under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800087#WRO04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800087#WRO04700"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[30253\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800087#WRO04800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of the 10,000 social housing units currently in his Department's plans which have not yet commenced the part 8 process.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>Certain projects listed in the Social Housing Construction Status Report are not subject to the Part 8 process; these include projects being advanced by Approved Housing Bodies and projects by private developers that are being acquired on a turn-key basis by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not have comprehensive information on the Part 8 process in all cases as this is a local authority matter and, in the interests of expediting projects, it is not uncommon for the Part 8 process and my Department's approval process to operate in parallel rather than in sequence.

Section 8(4) of the Building Control Act 1990 provides that a Building Control Authority may serve an Enforcement Notice requiring that such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, including Part B - Fire Safety, be taken within a specified period.  An Enforcement Notice may be served at any time up to five years from the completion of the Building Works.  Under the Building Control Regulations, Building Control Authorities are required to maintain a\u00a0register of any enforcement notices served by them, including brief particulars of the contents of the notice, which must be made available for public inspection. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 local authorities are designated as fire authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 20 of the Act provides that the appropriate fire authority may serve a Fire Safety Notice on the owner or occupier of any building which appears to the authority to be a potentially dangerous building.  Section 20 of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the tragic\u00a0fire in Grenfell Tower, the immediate focus of attention has been on life safety issues.  In that context, I\u00a0requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional. <\/p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness amongst private landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, the Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to\u00a0remind all landlords of their statutory responsibilities and obligations as landlords to ensure that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  The RTB placed a notice to this effect on its website and will be writing\u00a0 individually to all registered landlords providing detailed information in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all\u00a0registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing\u00a0or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance\u00a0with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety.  It\u00a0was issued to 57,000 registered users including builders, assigned\u00a0certifiers, designers and owners.<\/p>  <p>  I also met\u00a0with Dublin&rsquo;s Chief Fire Officer to discuss fire safety and life safety issues in light of the London tragedy.\u00a0\u00a0I also requested that the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) convene and assess the readiness of the fire authorities to respond to emergencies.  In response to this request, the NDFEM Board has confirmed to me that the recent report of the Directorate&rsquo;s External Validation group found that the public are well served by the developed arrangements in place for fire services in Ireland, and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.  A further meeting with all of the national Chief Fire Officers will be convened shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I have\u00a0 tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with co-ordinating\u00a0a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the\u00a0Grenfell Tower fire.  The\u00a0further issues to be considered, in addition to those outlined above,\u00a0include:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - The preliminary survey of the use of cladding products on residential buildings over 18m (6 storeys) being undertaken by fire services in Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country and to cover buildings in all categories over 18m in height.  The results to be reported to\u00a0my Department by 19 July.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - My\u00a0Department is to meet with the local authority Chief Fire Officers in the coming weeks to review current activities and to plan for further fire safety initiatives in prioritised areas of action.<\/p>  <p>  - Responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed by Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act 1981\u00a0on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building.  In order to assist those in both the public and private sector who hold this responsibility, consideration is being given to the publication of a guide on undertaking Fire Safety Assessments as provided for in Section 18 (6)(a) of the Act.  This will facilitate persons having control of buildings to demonstrate that they are complying with their statutory responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  - I will be updating my\u00a0\u00a0Cabinet colleagues on the post Grenfell Tower\u00a0fire situation and highlighting the implications of fire safety responsibilities in buildings across all sectors, both public and private.<\/p>  <p>  - A renewed focus is to be placed on the preparations of local authorities, working with the Principal Response Agencies and others, for large scale evacuation and operation of rest centres under the aegis of the Framework for Major Emergency Management.<\/p>  <p>  - I will consider all issues emerging, including regulatory arrangements, in line with developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800087#WRO06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Repair and Leasing Scheme","counter":743,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP00300"},{"type":"question","counter":744,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[30327\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of vacant properties that are being brought back to use under the repair and leasing scheme for each local authority, in tabular form; his views on whether the target of 800 units for 2017 will be achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":745,"content":"<p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.<\/p><p>Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites, exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.

There are currently more than\u00a023,000 households in receipt of HAP, including more than 7,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement.  On average in 2017, 330 new households are being supported by HAP each week.  The nationwide roll-out of the HAP scheme was completed following its introduction on 1 March 2017 to the Dublin City, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown Local Authority areas.\u00a0 Eligible households in all 31 Local Authority areas can now avail of the scheme.\u00a0 HAP has been particularly successful in the South Dublin County Council (SDCC) area, where it has been available since 1 October 2014, and currently supports over 1,760 tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  The Government increased the maximum rent limits available under the HAP and Rent Supplement schemes across the country with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority, South Dublin County Council in this case, to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region, and 88% of all homeless households have benefited from some level of this homeless specific discretion.  The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market.  This proportion of households utilising discretion in the Dublin City Council administrative area reflects the DRHE's role in processing HAP applications for all eligible\u00a0homeless households, across the four Dublin local authorities.  When homeless households are excluded, the use of discretion of HAP in the Dublin City area is similar to that of SDCC, with 1.2% of all households supported \u00a0utilising the discretion available.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of Q1 2017, 14.4% of the total number of households across the country being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  Excluding homeless households, 9.6% of all households being supported were benefiting from the additional flexibility and in those cases the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.3% above rent limits provided.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the\u00a0scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Data","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[30283\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062800088#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if all agencies under his aegis have an up to date tax clearance certificate; the agencies which do not have an up to date tax clearance certificate; the reason they do not have a tax clearance certificate in each case, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>The only State body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board.
