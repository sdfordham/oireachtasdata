Scoil &Eacute;anna, Bullaun, Loughrea, County Galway is in crisis.  The people of Bullaun are desperate for, and have been promised, a new school.  It is astonishing to me that, given the severity of their situation, pupils and teachers are forced to endure this entirely unsuitable and highly dangerous situation nine years after being promised a new building.  Scoil &Eacute;anna is a standard three-classroom school built in 1959 on 0.6 of an acre.  As a result of a huge increase in the local population, its enrolment has spiralled from 39 pupils in 2000 to 187 pupils in 2014.  This increase in enrolment has necessitated the instalment of four prefabs, two of which are being accommodated outside the school's rear boundary wall and on the generosity and community spirit of several landowners.  This situation has understandably tested the goodwill of people in the area, and in addition to the 2012 of the fourth prefab, which was made difficult by persistent rain, fifth and sixth classes have to be taught in the local hall in Bullaun which was built in 1888.  This is causing massive disruption to all concerned and impacts on teachers and students alike.<\/p> <p>The annual cost of prefab rental is close to &euro;40,000.  A fourth prefab was purchased last year for close to &euro;65,000.  Given the glaring need for a new school, the community understandably feels this is imprudent and wasteful spending.  I agree wholeheartedly.  The installation of these prefabs has also placed huge demands on the 1959 percolation system in place at the school.  The adjoining land has been badly damaged during the installation of prefab four, which is also an issue.  The school's septic tank is absorbing water from the water table and in the past year has been emptied and desludged several times.  A recent health and safety audit condemned the system.  The school board has applied for emergency works to be carried out on its percolation system and the Department has sanctioned funding.  The school community, however, has been unable to proceed with the project because of space restrictions and difficulties with planning permissions.  There is literally no space whatsoever to install the system.<\/p> <p>In respect of health and safety and the day-to-day well-being of all in the school, this is shameful and must be tackled urgently.  I feel very strongly about this because I have brought it up on several occasions in this House and the staff and pupils of Scoil &Eacute;anna have entered their ninth year of waiting for a new school, despite all I have said.  I commend the generosity of the patron of the school, Bishop John Kirby, who has agreed to make a sizeable site available for construction of a new school in Bullaun, located beside the village car park, which is a very safe location.  There have been site engineer evaluations and hydrologist reports for this proposed new site which deem it very suitable.  These facts and the escalating difficulties facing Scoil &Eacute;anna and the community lead me to ask in the strongest possible terms why work has not commenced on this new school.  I urge the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills to swiftly examine the situation as a crisis because children have graduated from Scoil &Eacute;anna having spent their entire primary school education in infrastructure that is not fit for purpose.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2385\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2385&amp;amp;pid=LorraineHiggins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is horrendous and something no child should have to put up with in the 21st century, particularly in an education system that is supposed as good as the one we talk about in this country.  <\/p><p>I commend the principal, Fergal Connaire, for all his work.  I also commend the teachers, other members of staff and pupils at Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna as well as the local community for the spirit, endeavours and generosity it has shown and the huge efforts it has made in raising funds over the years.  The fruits of all their fund-raising efforts lie in a bank account awaiting the commencement of work on this new school.  It is high time the Department of Education and Skills kicked into gear and moved on this matter once and for all because no child or teacher should be forced to learn or work in a school building that is so thoroughly unsuitable and that goes back decades and generations.  Students are being taught and are learning in a hall in Bullaun that dates from 1888.  I stand with every single person in Bullaun when it comes to this issue and am calling for this issue to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#B00400","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, Minister for Education and Skills.  I wish to thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position relating to the application for a new school building in the case of Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna, Bullaun, Loughrea, County Galway.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the over-riding objective of education capital expenditure is to meet the demographic challenge facing the education system whereby total pupil enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by around 107,000 additional pupils between 2012 and 2019 - over 70,000 at primary level and over 35,000 at post primary - and will continue to rise at post-primary level to the year 2026 at least.  The five-year construction plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.<\/p> <p>In this regard, Loughrea has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth.  Pupil enrolment projections for Loughrea indicate that enrolments will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future.  However, the Department has acknowledged the accommodation issues outlined here today arising in respect of Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna, Bullaun.  Having examined the existing school site, it became apparent in late 2013 that the site is too restricted and cannot be expanded to meet the deficit of permanent accommodation and provide an appropriate wastewater treatment system for the school in question.  In that regard, it was concluded that a new school site is required.<\/p> <p>In that context, the school advised during a meeting with Department officials in December 2013 that the patron is willing to offer a green field site for a new school development.  The Department requested site maps and confirmation from the patron that the green field site would be offered for development.  The information requested was received by the Department in early 2014 on foot of which a technical site visit was undertaken.<\/p> <p>Following the site visit, the school's board of management were advised in mid-2014 to appoint a suitably qualified consultant engineer to examine and comment on the ground conditions and water treatment system requirements in respect of the proposed green field site.  The board of management was also advised that it would also be necessary for the consultant to hold a pre-planning meeting with Galway County Council regarding the site's suitability for development.  The consultant appointed by the board of management concluded that a further tier two assessment of the site would be required and my Department's technical advisers concurred with this advice.  This completed report was submitted to the Department in early 2015.  The report has been considered and the Department is satisfied that the proposed site is suitable for the development of a new school building.  As a result of this, I am pleased to inform the Senator that this project will be progressed into the architectural planning process without delay so it is beginning to move through those gears.  <\/p> <p>The building project for Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna is one of a number of schools which it was not possible to include in the five-year construction programme.  However, the school project will be progressed to the final planning stages so that it will be well placed for consideration in the context of future construction programmes.  Hopefully, the next one will be announced later on this year.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#C00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response in which he mentioned demographics.

Louth County Council stopped it in progress and the developer subsequently applied for retention, which the council refused.  The developer appealed the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which upheld the council's decision, stating in its report, \"This development is unsustainable, backland development and totally inappropriate in a residential area\".  The wall was built seven and a half years ago and it remains to this day and greatly devalues the nearby houses.  Some three years later, Louth County Council received an application for permission to build a 2 m wall and granted permission.  However, this ugly structure has not been reduced in height and, in my opinion, it never will be.  Some three years later, the developer has taken no action.<\/p> <p>To add insult to injury, the local authority has deemed the structure unsafe and, 18 months ago, put an unsafe notice on it, which the developer and applicant have ignored.  I believe no action will be taken by either developer or applicant and it is long overdue that the local authority take immediate action to demolish and remove this monstrosity.  The previous CEO agreed to do it, but given that she was moved to higher places, it has not happened.  My raising the issue as a Commencement matter is a last resort due to my frustration at how Louth County Council has handled and prolonged the issue over recent years.

In view of what he has outlined, I can understand his frustration.  In that context, I am happy to try to address this issue for him.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the planning system is to ensure development takes place in a planned, controlled and sustainable manner which protects the interests of the common good and the many qualities of our natural and built environment.  Active and effective enforcement of the planning legislation by planning authorities is critical for the credibility and integrity of the planning system.  I am firmly of the view that appropriate enforcement action should be taken in a timely manner where legal requirements are not upheld.  This is necessary to ensure the planning system and, more important, public confidence in it are not undermined in any way.<\/p> <p>Under planning legislation, any development which requires planning permission and which does not have such permission is considered unauthorised, as is development which contravenes conditions laid down in a planning permission.  Under the Planning Acts, comprehensive powers are available to, and clear and extensive actions are required of, planning authorities regarding enforcement in the context of unauthorised development.  In the first instance, planning authorities are required to issue a warning letter in respect of any complaints received regarding unauthorised development or in the context of any other unauthorised development of which they otherwise become aware.  They are then required to carry out an investigation into the alleged unauthorised development.  Following such an investigation, the relevant authority must decide, as expeditiously as possible, whether to issue an enforcement notice.  Where such a notice is issued, the planning authority is required to specify that development cease in circumstances where no planning permission has been granted or, where it has been granted, require that the development proceed in accordance with the permission.  Furthermore, planning authorities are empowered to specify in an enforcement notice the steps to be taken within a specified period to conform with a permission.  Where the steps specified are not complied with, they are empowered to enter on the land and take such steps, including the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure, as are deemed necessary, as well as to recover any costs incurred.<\/p> <p>My Department's development management guidelines, which were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act and to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the discharge of their planning functions, urge planning authorities to ensure that court prosecutions follow in the case of all enforcement notices not complied with.  Court conviction can result in both fines and imprisonment.  I understand the unauthorised development to which the Senator refers and which involves a 5 m high boundary wall surrounding a particular housing development has been in place for quite a number of years, even though the planning permission granted was for a 2 m high boundary wall.  I also understand that, as the Senator outlined, an extension of duration of planning permission was granted in respect of the housing development in question in 2011 and that this was subject to a reduction in the height of the wall to that originally granted.  Even though there have been some problems in identifying ownership of the site, effective enforcement action by the planning authority concerned is still essential.  I am informed that an enforcement notice has been issued in this case.  Given the length of time this unauthorised development has been in place and the adverse effects on the amenity of the adjoining property owners and residents over that period, I expect the planning authority will vigorously follow through on this enforcement notice and take the necessary steps to ensure it is complied with as expeditiously as possible.<\/p> <p>Non-compliance with the planning legislation is something that should not be tolerated and non-enforcement in respect of breaches of the planning code sends out the wrong message and encourages further transgressions of the planning laws.  I again urge all planning authorities to discharge their functions in this regard and to ensure any breaches of the planning code are swiftly addressed in accordance with their statutory obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#E00100","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Winner all right.

On 25 March, an independent report into the deaths of 12 children in State care or known to child protection services severely criticised the State's social work and mental health services.  Four of these cases concerned young women between the ages of 14 and 19 with emotional difficulties who had taken their own lives.  Three of them had been on lengthy waiting lists for psychological services.  Dr. Helen Buckley, chair of the national review panel said that one of the girls was unable access to mental health services in the days leading up to her death, which is a damning indictment of our health service.  In explaining delays in psychology services, Ms Anne O'Connor, HSE director of mental health services stated it was the lack of psychological candidates and not HSE funding that was causing the delays.<\/p> <p>I have been reliably informed that, in November 2014, there were 27 vacant HSE psychology posts in disability, mental health and child and adolescent mental health services but, at the same time, more than 80 counselling psychologists were available on the HSE psychology panel.  It appears, therefore, it is not the shortage of suitably candidates but a change in the appointment criteria that is causing this serous and, in some cases, life threatening backlog.  Up to 2009, counselling psychologists were actively recruited in all areas of mental health and currently they work in all areas of the HSE, some at senior levels.  Given the changed recruitment procedures, they would now be unable to apply for posts they hold.  The HSE has never given a reason or evidence for the basis of this change.  The professional body for accreditation of psychologists, the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, stated, \"No candidate should be excluded from applying solely on the basis of their named professional qualification in psychology\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

In a statement obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, a 2013 report of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, concluded that in the event of the HSE not adopting the position of the Psychological Society of Ireland in respect of the eligibility criteria, it needed to provide a robust case to support its position.  To date, I am unaware of any supporting case having been made, and I respectfully request the Minister to take up the issue with the HSE.<\/p><p>I am aware, however, of a long-established relationship between the HSE and the clinical psychologist profession in Ireland, which has evolved from an apprenticeship model in which the HSE sponsored the training of clinical psychologists and their subsequent placement in posts in the HSE.  However, I argue that this model, which was designed to meet the service needs of the HSE and has worked very well for clinical psychologists therein, no longer adequately meets the now urgent service needs of the sector.  The time has come for a different, more flexible, expanded and, if necessary, more bespoke recruitment process.  Each year the country produces clinical and counselling psychologists of the highest calibre, and it is regrettable, even scandalous, that posts remain unfilled as young people die because of the failure to resolve this recruitment issue.<\/p><p>To sum up, I will ask the Minister a number of important questions.  Why were the eligibility criteria changed in 2009?  Who made the decision to change them?  Who sanctioned this change and why has the HSE sought to recruit clinical psychologists from abroad while refusing to employ counselling psychologists who already have passed HSE interviews and remain on the panels?  How was this situation allowed to develop when there are serious waiting lists and people are in dire need of professional medical help?  Although there are already fully qualified counselling psychologists on the panel, no appointments are being made.  I respectfully ask for the Minister to intervene in this serious situation because, to paraphrase an old adage, service directors differ and patients die.  There is far more at stake here than posts and disputes over eligibility criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#F00300","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue today.  As the Senator will be aware, psychologists employed by the health service play an integral role in the delivery of a wide range of psychological services.  These include working with children and their families who present with developmental, emotional or behavioural difficulties and others who have intellectual and physical disabilities.  Services also include working with adolescents with a wide range of difficulties from adjustment problems to serious mental health issues and working with adults who present with mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and mental disorders.<\/p> <p>The HSE employs professionally trained psychologists, including counselling psychologists, clinical psychologists and educational psychologists, in a range of roles across the health service.  Psychologists working in the health service provide their services in a number of different ways - as part of a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, as part of a network of health professionals or as sole health professionals providing a service to a client.  They provide services across a broad range of settings, including community-based health centres, residential centres, nursing homes and hospitals.<\/p> <p>Under section 22 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the authority to appoint persons to be employees and may determine their duties.  This includes appointments to psychology services.  The HSE is bound under section 22 of the Act to conduct recruitment in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which is underpinned by codes of practice.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments is the independent body established in 2004 to ensure that these codes of practice are adhered to.  The HSE's national recruitment service conducts all recruitment activity for the health service, including recruitment to all positions in the psychology service.  The HSE is responsible for determining eligibility criteria for recruitment purposes, and this has been fully acknowledged and accepted by the CPSA.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, it has been the HSE's intention to undertake a review of the recruitment and selection criteria for psychology grades in the health service.  A working group is being established by the HSE and it is expected that the work will commence within two weeks.  The terms of reference are currently being finalised and it is hoped the group will deliver its recommendations within six months.  In the interests of service users and their families, I, along with the Minister for State with responsibility for primary and social care, welcome the consideration the HSE is giving to this important issue, and we look forward to receiving the group's review report, once completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#G00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister says and I understand his own concerns in this area.

I refer to the primary income supports impacting those with disabilities and their families.  The disability allowance and the carer's allowance have also been cut by 8%.  There is a lot of spending to be done in that area.

Reading some of the correspondence from IBRC to the Department and some of the public commentary from IBRC sources over the past few days, one could be forgiven for forgetting that IBRC was an entity that was fully funded by the taxpayer and not market-capitalised.

However, EU bureaucracy can drive one nuts.  It is particularly sad when our Government fails to spot the madness in proposed EU laws and to ensure that such laws are changed in circumstances where they might impact badly on us.  An example in this regard is the sustainable pesticides use directive, which was introduced in Ireland during the past year.  The stated aim of this directive is good, namely, to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.  New classes of pesticide users have been created.  In particular, farmers will now be classed as professional users of pesticides.  The directive stipulates that all professional users must be registered by 26 November next.  After that date, only a registered professional or a person operating under his or her direct supervision will be able to purchase and use pesticides.  What people do not realise is that in order to be registered, one must first obtain trained professional user certification.  As a result, a farmer who uses pesticides, regardless of how much or how little, will be obliged to complete a module of a level 5 or 6 Teagasc-FETAC at a cost of up to &euro;1,000.  This directive will apply regardless of whether one uses a small, hand-held pesticide sprayer or a massive, tractor-pulled trailer sprayer.  The directive also contains a requirement to the effect that those who use pesticides must maintain records of how and when they are used.<\/p> <p>The new regulations that will apply in this regard have been correctly described by John Comer, president of the ICMSA, as being excessive and outright ridiculous.  The majority of those involved in farming in this country are grassland farmers who raise livestock.  In comparison to large-scale tillage farmers in Britain and on the Continent, these individuals rarely use pesticides.  It is absolute madness, therefore, that small livestock farmers will be required to do a training course in order that they might use even knapsack or hand-held sprayers.  Small farmers in the areas surrounding Athenry and Tuam who do not undertake large-scale spraying operations will be obliged to sit through lectures aimed at farmers who sprays thousands of gallons of pesticide each year and to pay for the privilege of having their time wasted while they do so.  Failure to comply with the requirement will make these people liable to prosecution.<\/p> <p>I request that we hear from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in early course on this matter.  The infuriating aspect is that there was originally a proposal that low-level users of pesticides should be exempt from the training requirement.  However, this was dropped.  Just as in the case of the negotiations on the nitrates directive, the various energy directives, so many other directives and rules and regulations which emanate from Brussels, those who represent the Government seem to have been asleep at the wheel.  We had an opportunity to carve out exemptions which would have been tailored to our particular situation here in Ireland.  However, the Department either ignored that opportunity or simply did not care enough to seize it.  These new rules will impose additional levels of bureaucracy and costs on farmers.  As Mr. Comer has stated, they border on the outright ridiculous.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, should review the regulations and, even at this juncture, he should seek an exemption in respect of low-level users of pesticides.  It would be appropriate for him to address the Seanad on this matter at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#U00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I welcome today's spring statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.

I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality come before the House at the earliest opportunity to outline, in the context of the brand new Jerusalem we have been hearing about from all those on the Government side, what she will do for the Garda.  Will the Government parties provide more resources?  A rank and file garda in County Monaghan said on radio earlier that he was one of only two members operating out of a station.  He or his partner were the only people manning the patrol car and it can take them up to 45 minutes to get to the scene of a crime within their own district.

Garda&iacute; are also being spat at and assaulted by a small sinister minority at some water charge protests.  Alarmingly, a new trend appears to have emerged whereby garda&iacute; are being trolled on social media with money offered online to obtain the names and addresses of garda&iacute; policing such protests.  At present, garda&iacute; have extendable batons, pepper spray and firearms but nothing in between and what is needed is a deterrent that is effective but which, unlike a firearm, is not designed to be lethal.  The current riots in the United States follow a number of previous fatal shootings by police in which firearms were used instead of tasers.  Although the misuse of tasers has resulted in relatively minute numbers of deaths globally, they were introduced in the United States as non-lethal weapons to be used by police to subdue potentially dangerous people who otherwise would have been subjected to a firearm.  In 2009, the Police Executive Research Forum showed that the number of officers injured dropped by 76% when tasers were introduced.  Although I strongly believe it should be used as a last resort, I support the use of tasers if and when the situation merits it.  As such, I am calling from resources to be made available to facilitate these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#W00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome all the positive vibes coming from Senator Darragh O'Brien in respect of the spring statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042800002#W00500","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1430227800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>The Leader is welcome.

A briefing on the European work programme will be held tomorrow, about which I have sent notice, and I hope there is a good attendance at it because we will have a debate on it in the House next week.  As part of the EU work programme a sub-committee which was formed in the House will deal with three specific items we intend to debate in the coming months.  I hope we will have a great input from Members when we debate the matter next week and that we have a good attendance at the briefing session tomorrow.<\/p><p>Senator Burke reminded us that last week Comhairle na n&Oacute;g was here to discuss mental health issues.

I understand this issue was discussed at length on Committee Stage with my colleague, Senator David Cullinane.  This amendment proposes the deletion of section 4 which deals with entitlement to carer's benefit, carer's allowance and respite care grant.  In a submission on the Bill, the Free Legal Advice Centres and the Community Law and Mediation Centre have called for the deletion of the section, arguing that it does nothing but make it more difficult for carers to access income supports.  They describe section 4 as negative law-making.  It introduces a presumption of ineligibility for the payment which the applicant will have to overcome, whereas at present, the applicant must demonstrate his or her entitlement and the deciding officer must make a reasoned decision from a position of neutrality and objectivity.

As he will be aware, two particular issues arose that have generated some controversy and outright opposition from this side of the House in respect of the family dividend and the fact we believe a financial burden will be placed unnecessarily on lone parents who are being forced back to the workforce as a result of this legislation.  Let us make no mistake about it, they will find themselves in a situation where their State benefits will be cut to the extent that they will have little choice but to try to seek work.  Usually that is part-time low-paid work.  I have asked previously and I ask again what will happen to the child in those circumstances who will be left home?  If there is nobody to care for the child, it means the lone parent will have to stay out of the workforce.  I have no problem with having a pathway to work, education and upskilling, but the bottom line is that the financial realities that will be imposed on lone parents will not result in the outcome proposed by the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not see why there is a need to introduce section 3 of this Bill regarding now having an additional deciding officer for the carer's allowance.  It now refers to a medical assessor who is an officer of the Minister.  GPs were, and continue to be, quite capable of assessing and evaluating the legitimacy or otherwise of a claim in this regard.  This seems to be just an added layer of bureaucracy that will result, ultimately, in some applicants being turned down despite the fact that their GP has approved them, which will save more money.  This is not progressive legislation.  It is a cost-saving exercise and it is not addressing the priorities in the area of social welfare.  In the context of the spring statements today, when we are talking about the proposed new land of milk and honey that is being proposed by the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, it is sad that the people who are most disadvantaged in society and who are relying on State benefits will find themselves out of pocket as a result of this legislation.

It is another case of the Government hammering lone parents, who have been given a very raw deal since this Government came into office.  In addition, the Government has not been willing to take on the amendments we have put forward in good faith.  Some of them have been ruled out of order, but we wanted to propose again the raising of the cut-off age for the one-parent family payment scheme to 12 years, instead of lowering it to seven, as the Government is doing.  The Government passed legislation in 2012, the purpose of which was to lower the cut-off age for the lone parents scheme from ten years to just seven years of age from this coming July.  This is too young, particularly in the absence of the affordable child care and after-school care which was promised by the Government but which has not been delivered on.  We propose this so that the social welfare Bill that is currently being dealt with in the committee would call off the scheduled cut and instead raise the cut-off age to 12 years.<\/p> <p>It is scandalous that this Bill is being brought forward without all the other elements the Minister said she would bring in to support lone parents, many of whom are fighting to make ends meet.  They find it very difficult.
