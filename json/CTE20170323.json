The correspondence is marked \"private and confidential: subject to legal professional privilege\".  The clerk requested clarification on what the Central Bank means by that but I am now informed that our legal advisers have said we can note and publish that and send it back to the people concerned.

Nos. 333C(i) and (ii) are from Mr. Aidan Sweeney of IBEC providing a policy brief to the committee in relation to local authorities.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.  Members can use it as they wish.<\/p> <p>  No. 34C is a letter dated 4 March 2017 from an individual raising a number of environmental issues and the lack of joined-up thinking across State and semi-State organisations.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 335C is a letter dated 8 March from an individual inquiring about the status of an OPW examination of cases in relation to land transactions being carried out in 2015 where there was potential for corruption.  The secretariat has contacted the OPW for an update on the case or the results of the examination.  When we get the information, we can forward it to the individual.  Is it agreed that we note the correspondence and hold it over until we get a reply?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 337C is a letter dated 10 March from the National Transport Authority providing a note on the licensing of bus services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 338C and 340C are from an individual alleging a series of issues in relation to the Garda, the HSE and her workplace.  A number of people are specifically mentioned.  This is a sensitive case and relates to a number of loosely related matters.  The clerk has spoken to the person by phone also.  While we would like to be helpful, it is not within the scope of the committee to investigate the specific matters.  It also appears the individual may be not be clear in terms of how the issues can be best examined.  I propose we write to the person explaining the committee's role but indicating that she should contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission if she believes an issue arises in connection with the Garda; that she should contact the Medical Council in relation to alleged medical mistreatment, to which she referred in the letter; and she should contact the Workplace Relations Commission to seek advice on work related matters.  Beyond that, I do not think we can do a whole lot.  Her letter gives rise to wide-ranging issues.  We want to be helpful to the person but it is not a matter for us.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 339C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 14 March from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board responding to a request for a detailed note on the overall estimated cost of the new children's hospital development project.  In the letter, it is mentioned that a memorandum is to go to Government in the coming weeks and that costs will be set out and discussed by the Government.  Following that the committee will receive a more complete response.  Does any member wish to comment?

Members will recall we have had a number of items of correspondence on this matter.  The Minister's office has reviewed the matter and liaised with the HSE which believes it is complying with its commercial obligations.  From the committee's point of view, I believe we cannot take it further, as it is essentially a contractual dispute between the association and the HSE.  I propose we write to the North Meath Community Development Association and advise it accordingly that the committee cannot take the matter any further at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 345C is dated 16 March 2017 and is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in relation to the Water Framework Directive.  I propose we forward a copy to the correspondent who raised the matter, who happens to be the same individual who wrote to us in relation to the environmental issues discussed earlier.  We are still waiting a detailed response from the Department following our recent meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 348C (i) and (ii) is from Nursing Homes Ireland dated 16 March 2017 providing a submission to the committee on the HSE response to the committee in relation to residential care costs.  I think members may want to consider this further.  I propose that we have another engagement with the HSE sometime after Easter and that could be one of the issues we will discuss.  Since the committee first met in the second half of 2016 we have had the HSE in to speak on several occasions, including on Console.  Recently, the HSE was in to speak specifically on nursing homes and patients' private fund accounts.  Today, Mr. O'Brien is in to deal with the record of the previous meeting, but the committee in the normal course of events would schedule a full meeting to discuss HSE matters.  We will schedule a meeting and that issue can be included.  We have not had the HSE in to discuss its accounts for the year.  We will set a date for that and deal with the issue then.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>No. 349C dated 21 March is correspondence from an individual raising matters in connection with Bord na gCon accounts.  The individual suggests we get the figures for the first quarter of 2017 when we engage with Bord na gCon.

Today we have the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE in the afternoon.  The HSE will be here to deal with the record of previous HSE meetings.  <\/p> <p>  We are scheduling the Higher Education Authority for a meeting next Wednesday and are suggesting 5 o'clock.  We had intended dealing with it this afternoon but because of the HSE issue, we have moved the HEA to next week.  We want to get it in before we meet with the third level institutions.  On Thursday, 30 March we have UCC, Dundalk Institute of Technology and University of Limerick.  On 6 April, we have Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and National University of Ireland Galway.  The meeting with the Higher Education Authority is scheduled for 5 p.m. next Wednesday but it may have to be moved because the business committee is considering the timing of the D&aacute;il debate on our report on Project Eagle.  There is a question of it being taken in Government time which will be next Wednesday evening.  If that is the case, we will have to change the time and make the meeting with the HEA a little bit earlier.  We will know when the business committee finishes its work today.  We will come back to the committee if there is a change of time in that.  We thought it might be on Wednesday morning at 11.50 a.m. but it might be taken in Government time on Wednesday so our meeting might have to move a little bit.  That is 6 April.  <\/p> <p>  On 13 April, we will have the Department of Education and Skills in to deal with the special report on the residential institutions redress fund and the follow through on that.  Representatives from Caranua will join us for that meeting.  There has been a lot of public discussion about Caranua.  The following week is the Easter break and we are not sitting that week.  The D&aacute;il is not sitting the week after that either so there is a two-week D&aacute;il break.  Do members want to sit that second week and have a meeting to deal with some of our issues or are we happy to leave the two-week break?  I do not detect any gushing enthusiasm for an earlier meeting.  We will move on.<\/p> <p>  Provisionally we have the Revenue Commissioners set for 4 May.  On 11 May we have the Department of Finance.  There is an issue we have to deal with.

In addition, the Department administers the National Training Fund, NTF, which recorded expenditure of &euro;334 million in 2015.  The Vote and the fund are managed together within an overall spending limit which is set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  On the income side, receipts into the Vote as appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;549 million.  Over 93% of this, or &euro;513 million, comprised employee pension contributions and pension related deductions from teachers&rsquo; and other education sector employees&rsquo; salaries.  Receipts into the fund, totalling &euro;370 million in 2015, come mainly from a statutory training levy collected on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Revenue Commissioners as part of employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions.  <\/p> <p>  The gross Vote expenditure was spread across four expenditure programmes, as shown in the graph now on screen.  Note 3 in the appropriation account gives a more detailed breakdown of each of the programmes.  As the graph shows, the preponderance of expenditure was in the first, second and early years education programme, at 71%, followed by the higher education programme, at 17%.  Over 87% of the &euro;6.2 billion voted expenditure on first, second and early years education relates to the pay and pension costs of teachers, special needs assistants and non-teaching school staff.  Other substantial areas of spending included in the programme are capitation and other grants to schools and the cost of school transport.  This programme also includes spending on residential institutions redress, about which I have reported separately, and which the committee has indicated it will examine in the coming weeks. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure under the higher education programme was &euro;1.5 billion.  This consists mainly of grants to third level education institutions of &euro;922 million, channelled through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and student support grants totalling &euro;414 million.  The original Vote Estimate provided for student support grants of &euro;332 million, down from &euro;372 million in 2014, representing a reduction of around 11%.  The outturn for the year was 25% higher than originally provided and was funded substantially by a Supplementary Estimate provision of &euro;78 million.  The committee may wish to note that student support grants are administered nationally on behalf of the Department by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, under the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, system. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on capital services in 2015 was &euro;655 million, made up of &euro;577 million in building and equipment grants across the education sectors, &euro;66 million in payments under public private partnership, PPP, agreements and the balance of &euro;11 million in administration costs.  Forward capital commitments under contracted PPP arrangements at the end of 2015 amounted to an estimated &euro;478 million, as indicated in the notes to the account.  When recurrent commitments under the PPPs are included, the total legally enforceable commitments amounted to an estimated &euro;1.34 billion.<\/p> <p>  Almost all of the &euro;330 million spent on skills development under the Vote represents funding provided to SOLAS, the further education and training body.  SOLAS income in 2015 was &euro;591 million which included the grant funding received from the Vote and funding of &euro;279 million from the NTF. <\/p> <p>  The overall grant funding provided to the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, is not evident from the appropriation account.  The boards were established in 2013 following the dissolution of vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took on certain training functions of the former F&Aacute;S.  Excluding the student support grant funding provided to CDETB that I referred to earlier, over 90% of the combined income of the boards, which is estimated at around &euro;1.5 billion in 2015, originates from the Vote or the NTF.  The first, second and early years education programme covers ETB teacher and other salaries and school capitation grants.  SOLAS provides funding to the ETBs for further education and training and finally, building and equipment grants paid to ETBs are financed from the capital programme. <\/p> <p>  About a month ago, I published a special report on financial reporting in the public sector.  In that report, I highlighted a general problem around the late finalisation of the ETB financial statements for 2013-14.  These were the first financial statements for the new boards.  A number of the new boards had difficulties putting the required reporting arrangements in place across the revised areas of operation.  At present, statements for the 2013-14 period of account for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB remain uncertified.  The 2015 financial statements for 11 of the ETBs have been completed and presented to the Oireachtas and the audits of three ETBs for 2015 are at various stages of progress.<\/p><p>Two education and training boards, ETBs, have not yet produced draft financial statements for 2015, namely, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and Limerick and Clare ETB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.<\/p> <p>  I propose the committee writes to the chairpersons of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and Limerick and Clare ETB, requesting an immediate explanation as to why their accounts for 2015 have not been prepared to date.<\/p> <p>  I call Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#E00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the 2015 appropriation accounts of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have provided the committee with briefing material and, accordingly, in the interests of making best use of the committee's time, I will keep my opening statement short.<\/p> <p>  The Department's net voted expenditure in 2015 was nearly &euro;8.2 billion.  Of this, &euro;621 million was capital expenditure.  In addition, the Department's expenditure ceiling included the non-voted national training fund, which had an allocation of &euro;362 million in 2015, providing for upskilling and re-skilling for both of those seeking employment and those in employment.  The Department received &euro;549 million in appropriations-in-aid.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 80% of the Department's overall budget is accounted for by pay and superannuation.  In 2015, this provided for over 98,000 public service employees and over 44,000 public service pensioners.<\/p> <p>  The Department's expenditure is subdivided into four expenditure programmes.  Programme A provides for first, second and early years' education.  The overall expenditure in 2015 was &euro;6.2 billion, which among other things, covered pay and superannuation for teachers and special needs assistants, grants to schools, including capitation, costs associated with teacher education and provision of school transport.<\/p> <p>  Programme B covers skills development, including upskilling and re-skilling that meets the needs of individuals and the labour market.  The overall expenditure from the Vote in 2016 was &euro;329 million, which among other things, covered grants to Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, SOLAS, in respect of further education and training.  It also provides funding for support of the European Social Fund and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's activities in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Programme C supports learning, research and innovation opportunities in the higher education sector.  Expenditure in 2015 was over &euro;1.5 billion, covering grants to higher education institutions, superannuation costs, research, student support and related costs, international activities and grants to the Higher Education Authority.<\/p> <p>  Programme D covers capital services and supports the planning and provision of appropriate infrastructure for learning environments through the Department's building programme.  The total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;655 million which covered the costs of building, equipping and furnishing of schools, higher education capital costs and costs associated with public private partnerships.<\/p> <p>  The Department was voted a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;175 million towards the end of 2015.  This made provision for an increased allocation of special needs assistants, increased superannuation payments in the schools and institute of technology sectors, an additional allocation for higher education student support and provision for summer works scheme.  The Supplementary Estimate also took account of a projected shortfall in the level of receipts to be brought to account in 2015.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious the issue of timeliness in the submission of accounts and financial statements is a matter of concern to the committee.  It was flagged as an issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent special report.  The report acknowledges the background to these delays, including the pressures which resulted from the public service moratorium, the significant organisational change which has taken place in the ETB sector and the particular complexities which pertain in the university sector given the significant amounts of non-Exchequer funding.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue which the Department is taking seriously.  We have been engaging with sectors on measures to improve reporting capabilities, including filling critical vacancies.  In our engagement with our bodies, we have strengthened our emphasis on the importance of timely submission of accounts.  We have also stressed the importance of communication and engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to ensure a collaborative approach to addressing issues which arise.<\/p> <p>  More widely, we see our response to this issue as part of an overall effort which the Department is undertaking to further develop and implement robust and consistent governance arrangements across the education sector.  Our aim is to ensure utilisation of public funds is achieved within a framework of high standards of performance, accountability, compliance and oversight.  A management board committee on sectoral governance and accountability, which I chair, was established in 2015.  This committee provides overall guidance on the enhancement of governance arrangements across the education sector.  This has included enhancement of audit oversight in certain sectors, as well as ensuring enhanced compliance-reporting structures are in place specifically to address the timely clearance and certification of financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The committee also reviews work on governance enhancement across the education sector, for example, rolling compliance reviews being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, roll out of the financial services support unit at primary school level and work to review the code of practice for the governance of education and training boards.  The management board committee is complemented by a principal officer sectoral governance network, which includes principal officers with responsibility for public service bodies.  An internal audit education sector forum has also been established.<\/p> <p>  A specific sectoral governance unit has been set up in the Department.  This unit provides support to the management board committee and principal officer network, as well as undertaking work to support the enhancement and standardisation of governance and accountability oversight across the Department.  This has included rolling out of the first phase of a programme of governance compliance reviews involving the Department's non-commercial bodies.<\/p> <p>  This is an area we will continue to focus on, having regard to good practice and developments in governance generally, including issues which have been identified by the Committee of Public Accounts as part of its work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

This question really concerns teachers, primarily, who are also on our payroll.  We operate the biggest payroll in the State.  We have, I think, just over 100,000 payees.  The supplementary pension is a top-up pension paid by occupational pension providers in the period between retirement and age 66 to public servants who paid class A PRSI in order to ensure that they are not disadvantaged.  It is a rule of the pension scheme that a supplementary pension should cease or be abated as appropriate when a pensioner applies for and comes into receipt of the State pension.  This fact would have been documented to pensioners.  The advent of new pension legislation in late 2012 facilitated the sharing of information between this Department and the Department of Social Protection.  In late 2012 and early 2013, the Department conducted an analysis of those pensioners over 65 who were in receipt of a supplementary pension.  On completion of this analysis and a follow-up exercise, about 320 teacher pensioners were identified as being in receipt of a supplementary pension to which they were no longer entitled as they were also in receipt of a State pension from the Department of Social Protection.  Payment of the supplementary pension ceased as soon as possible and the overpayment calculated.  The gross overpayments amounted to &euro;2.7 million, however, net of statutory deductions they were likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.

Under that model there is a trust involved jointly between a religious order and the education and training board, formerly the VECs, or the community schools.  The predominant model was the denominational school model.  We have effectively stopped that model for new schools.<\/p> <p>  The model we have now is that the Department sources the land and enters into a lease agreement with the patron.  It may be land for a brand new school being established, in which case there is a process to decide on patronage, but equally it may be a school moving or expanding and needing a new piece of land.  We would normally buy that land now.  In exceptional circumstances the denominational body may have land they wish to provide but that is becoming very rare now, so we normally buy the land.  We, therefore, have ownership of the land for the future.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of releasing the interest in land that was previously held, that would generally occur where a school building is not in use any more and may no longer be needed.  Generally, the Catholic Church or another church body would have ownership of it.  The Department would have an interest, a lien, because of its investment and would get some repayment from the owner to release that interest.  It would typically be fairly small.  Typically, these cases occur with buildings that are no longer in educational use.  Sometimes we waive that.  Often we waive it if the building is going to continue in community use.  We would generally only seek payment if the building is being sold on for further use or if it is entering into commercial use.

I have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, although not in this particular session, on a number of occasions regarding Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  We had a hearing on it two and half or three years ago.  SUSI is operating very well.  It is processing applications in line with its objectives.  Obviously, it is very difficult to get that flow of information completely right, but it has been bringing back the time from which people can apply to as early as possible.  It has been processing those quickly.  Partly as a result of that, grants and fee payments are being processed more speedily.<\/p> <p>  The manner of releasing tranches of money to individuals was reviewed and revised and was brought forward a bit because of the pressures on individuals in the first term.  It pays slightly higher amounts to individuals in the first term than it did previously.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, having regard to the financial position of the higher education institutions, the timing of payments to those has been revised a couple of times.  We have tried different ways of doing that.  We are trying to maximise the appropriate way to transfer money from SUSI to the institutions.  We are particularly conscious of a few issues.<\/p><p>One is that not every recipient of student support completes his or her course.  Particularly in first year, there is an issue about completing the first term.  We have to be careful about that.  Also, people want to have their grant protected so that if they attend only half of the first term, they have protection in place if they seek to commence another course.  Issues such as that arise.  It is a matter of making sure we have appropriate arrangements in place.  There is a complex set of different arrangements that we put in place to bring that forward.  Particularly in the context of the Supplementary Estimate, we brought forward the payments to institutions given that higher education is in a very tight funding position.  We did not want to be under-funding from SUSI into the higher education sector.  We wanted to make sure that we were funding appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#G02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Naturally.

The first issue relates to the amalgamation of the VECs into the ETBs and the big change of which that was part.  They were effectively new State bodies which were amalgamated State bodies from the ETB.  That was the first issue.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue, concerning amalgamation, where we were amalgamating two and sometimes three former VECs into ETBs - both of the ones that were talked about here were actually three VECs coming together - they would have had different financial systems and so on.  We had reduced staffing as a result of the amalgamation so we have been working through, with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form and manner of the accounts.  We have been working through the updating of the systems and we are putting in place a shared financial services system, which is under way in planning, as well as a shared payroll system.  We are working that through.<\/p> <p>  For the ETBs that were particularly challenged, we have prioritised additional resources.  They are seeking to address this.  The particular one that has not completed the initial set of accounts has had to do a manual check through all its work.  It is working through that manual check at the moment.  It hopes to complete that in the next short while - we are talking weeks here - and it will move immediately to a manual check of the payments for the following year.  It is an 18-month account followed by a 12-month account.  The ETB is very conscious of the need to do that.  To be fair to that ETB, the VECs that make up that ETB actually had been fairly efficient in returning their accounts previously so it is not that they comprised an inefficient organisation coming in; it is just the mixing of the new organisation having regard to the staffing.  Particularly in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, there was a long-term sick-leave issue in the leadership of the accounts.  There were a number of different factors that gave rise to the issue.  That is not to say that the ETB is complacent about it.

It is not bonus money available to us to be spent on education and training.  It would be great if it was, but it is not.

One is a &euro;200 million bundle of higher education PPPs and the second is Grangegorman, where we are hoping to advance arrangements very speedily.  We have undertaken an exercise with higher education institutions relating to future funding of capital developments.  We put a call out to them regarding areas for which they would wish to have funding.  We will examine those in the context, hopefully, of the Government deciding to give us additional funding under the capital review or, possibly, in the context of the &euro;200 million programme of PPPs to which we are committed.  The European Investment Bank is one of the primary funders under the PPPs, so that is a good way to access funding.  The European Investment Bank is also a funder of developments in the university sector, which is very useful.  It enables them to borrow in addition to the commitments they get from the State.  It also can replace other areas of Exchequer borrowing in our capital plan.  We always work closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that some of the borrowing for the schools or other developments may be funded by the EIB.  That would be organised centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We would not be directly involved.<\/p> <p>  A further area of innovation, and it is one we are very conscious of, is the balance in funding where it occurs, particularly in higher education and in the university sector, but not uniquely.  There can be elements of philanthropical investment, so the full cost need not have to be borne by the State.  A building might be 50% funded through private sources, so the State investment is not the full investment.  Obviously there can be good returns for the State in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of different ways in which we are seeking to be innovative.  I would not rule out any other options in the future because it is an area we seek to keep under review.

It is trialling some arrangements with some of the ETBs about what capacity there is to move in that direction.  There have been movements in terms of funding mechanisms to try different streams and aspects of funding to move things around.  Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of public sector employees so there are limits.  However, there is some capacity that is used to tender for provision of services.  Combined with that, a lot of work on outcomes is under way.  A training programme participants annual survey by SOLAS is under way to look at completion rates and so on.  We are also looking at arrangements to put databases in further education and training in place so there can be follow on regarding the effectiveness of provision in order that we can see not just from returns from people but also from looking at Revenue records on an impersonal basis and social welfare to see where people are six months or a year on from having a completed a course.

We have published a discussion paper about investment in further and higher education.  I am not aware of responses having been received.  To be fair, there is a range of businesses.  They range from SMEs up to the big multinationals.  There is a recognition of the need to have sufficient funding in place for further and higher education and training.  I did not talk about the apprenticeship developments but those are under way as well.  It is a challenge for them.  To be fair to them, in our dialogue with them, some of them have been supportive of considering increases in the national training fund, NTF.  Listening to what they have been saying, they would like to see commitments from the State at the same time.  This is the first year in a number of years where we have been able to enhance the budget in higher education with the additional &euro;35 million we received in the budget.

We find it very valuable to be able to plan in a joined-up way for the education and training sector.  It is effectively a plan for us and our national agencies combined and we are seeking to do it in partnership with them.  There is a wide range of different aspects across all areas.  One of things we are trying not to get lost in, although it is important, is the issue of resources being the only thing.  Yes, there is a dependency on resources to expand provision but everything does not depend on additional resources.  We must look at how we can work resources; be more efficient, which is the business of this committee; decide to stop funding areas; change funding; and seek to increase funding having regard to the resources available to us.  It gives us a coherent way to seek to do that.  There are different challenges in each of the different sectors.  There are challenges for the Department and the national agencies in terms of prioritising.  We would operate a number of overlapping strategies within the action plan.  An example of that would be the national skills strategy, whose actions are embedded in it, or the literacy and numeracy strategy.

There are two other ways in which we are seeking to enhance multidenominational provision in addition to new schools.  One is what was called divesting arising from the report of the forum on pluralism.  A number of areas were identified and we seeking to negotiate in those areas for existing schools or school buildings that might not be in use or other public sector buildings to be transferred to our ownership or leased to us to enable us to open schools.  We have succeeded in about eight or ten schools in that regard.  I have the precise figure but I do not have it to hand.  We have initiated a further process where we are seeking to engage with the ETBs, communities and existing school patrons to see if there are possibilities for patronage change.  We are trying in a number of different ways.  It is a challenge because we do not own the school buildings.  The school buildings are owned by the local communities.  Regarding support for change in the community, if one takes a community that might have five schools, each of which might contain 20% who would like a change, it means that there is no majority for change in any of the five schools.  However, in the area as a whole, possibly a total of a single school population would wish to change.<\/p><p>This is down to negotiation in communities and so on and we see a potential valuable role for the education and training boards in having an involvement so there is not a perception of a top down approach from the Department in communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#N01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I note from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the Department made a settlement of &euro;1,359,358 with the Revenue Commissioners in March 2015 relating to the period, 2010-13.

Groups such as the National Parents' Council have been very supportive of this.  At the moment, the special education section combined with the inspectorate and NEPS and the NCSE are doing a series of information sessions with schools to explain how this is changing.  There was one in Croke Park this week for primary and post-primary schools, and there will be one next week in Limerick.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the earlier point about NEPS role, it will continue to have a role on resource teaching even under the new model but the role will be different.  It will be more supportive of schools.  Instead of NEPS spending time doing assessments, that time can be used more profitably assisting schools, working with pupils and teachers to support their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Connolly but I will return to her.<\/p> <p>  What about parents who were unable to get it through the one or two that were provided to the schools?

We are spending &euro;1.7 billion in 2017 on special education.  In 2007, we were spending about &euro;800 million.  There has been a huge commitment from the State under various Governments to enhancing expenditure to meet the needs of those with special educational needs.  We are always seeking to try to make it as effective as possible with our SNA review, our new model and the various arrangements we have to support school transport.  Balancing that with what we were talking about earlier in higher education, there has been a huge amount of investment in special education to try to meet the particular needs and try to be as helpful as we can to this group.  We have to acknowledge that in all of the discussions we have.  The issue for us is also about the effectiveness of the expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the specific issue about ASD units, we obviously work with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on ASD units.  It tries to advise and plan on where there is a need for ASD units to go.  Typically in new builds and new post-primary schools, we put in ASD units as we are doing them.  Typically, the NCSE and ourselves negotiate with primary schools and post-primary schools about the demand.  There is always a difficulty, especially at different times of the year when there is an uncertainty about where demands arise.  I am aware of different cases or groups of cases in which there are challenges.  This has been debated at the Oireachtas committee on education and in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  I and Mr. Tattan have discussed it with the Minister for consideration.  We are looking through the issues around ASD units and the demand at second level to try to get an evidential basis for that demand and to see if it is being met.  We believe the system is responding, but we need to double-check that having regard, as Deputy Connolly said, to information that is coming.  We have to be responsive.

We have put a huge amount of effort, in partnership with the NCSE, into ensuring that in terms of teacher allocations, rather than it being a decision made externally to a school, we give sufficient resources to the school to manage it and be responsive in a local context.

I am not sure what the outcome of that will be, but we have hugely increased our investment in SNAs.<\/p> <p>  We want to encourage children to stay in mainstream second level education.  We want to work with schools to put ASD units in place to enable that to be the case.  With the NCSE, we are working with all schools to ensure that can be the case.

That is one of the reasons we have a specific proposal in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to give the power to the NCSE to place a child with special educational needs in a school.

In the past few years, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs developed an early childhood care and education programme which also falls under the remit of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  People in the early childhood sector find they fall between three stools.  In the Action Plan for Education 2017, one of the key themes is the increased quality of learning in early years.  The Department states:<\/p><blockquote>We will continue to actively support the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to improve the quality of early year&rsquo;s provision.

I know Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; would know that those working in this sector are pioneering education there.  I would hope that the Department of Education and Skills would be an advocate for them and that it would speak about this sector coming within its remit.<\/p><p>In regard to the commitment in its action plan to deliver quality learning, the majority of people the Department is assisting are working for the minimum wage and my question is whether this is acceptable.

We cannot expand funding for places, where there enough places available already, for the purposes of choice.  We did that to a certain extent up until 2007 or 2008.  Given the pressures on the budget now, however, allowing a school to go from two streams down to one stream and building a new school next door is not an efficient use of Government money.  In simple terms, it is inefficient to fund for three streams but only have two in use.  However, it is never as simple as that and that is why we want to allow schools to reconfigure in the primary space.  If there is a demand for more Irish-medium or multi-denominational spaces, the best option is for a school to switch.  That way, we do not have to put in the investment again.  That is why we have this exercise with the ETBs.  In the particular case of north Kildare regarding the gaelchol&aacute;iste and an Aonad in the ETB school, that is under active consideration at the moment.  The case is very well made and we have committed to actively examining it.  I do not see that particular case as one involving huge costs.  Hopefully we will be able to sort that one out, given that the demand is shown and there is an expanding number of students in the area.

That is as much as I know.<\/p><p>This afternoon we are dealing with matters relating to the appearance of witnesses from the Health Service Executive, HSE, before the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  At our meeting two weeks ago, certain matters were raised relating to Grace, the case of abuse that was the focus of RTE's &quot;This Week&quot; programme of 5 March 2017.  These matters apparently conflict with evidence given by the HSE to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  The committee has asked the HSE to correct the record, if necessary, and to explain the reason for the apparent conflict arising from the programme.  I am glad a delegation from the HSE has joined us today to do so and Mr. O'Brien is welcome.<\/p><p>This is not an opportunity to reopen consideration of all matters discussed on that occasion.  I have received a copy of the statement proposed to be made and I am satisfied that it confines itself to the purpose of the meeting.  Having regard to the fact that a commission of investigation has been established by the Oireachtas, the Grace case must be regarded as <i>sub judice<\/i>and is effectively under a judge to examine at this point.  I repeat that we are not here to reopen the Grace case and the Oireachtas has established a commission of investigation to deal with it.  We are not a parallel commission of inquiry or examination of the Grace case.  I must be very clear about that.  It would not be in order to go beyond the very limited purposes of this session and put forward questions to witnesses, except to the extent to which they relate directly to the statement made and they are clearly necessary in order to clarify the context of today's statement.  In these circumstances it is my responsibility, as Chairman, to seek to ensure that questions asked are consistent with the purpose of the meeting, genuinely seeking clarification, and do not in any material way otherwise encroach or impinge upon the functions of a commission of investigation.  Accordingly, I expect members who may wish to ask questions to clearly identify the part of the statement from last year to which the question relates and the reason they believe clarification is necessary.<\/p><p>Before going any further I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, who is here along with Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell.  I thank them for coming and I acknowledge that a commission of investigation has been established.  They may have been within their rights not to come in view of the fact that the Oireachtas has established that commission of investigation.  We appreciate them coming before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with matters raised at a previous meeting.<\/p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>Before asking Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement, I should indicate that the sequence for questions will be Deputy Cullinane, Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Madigan and then Deputy Connolly.  I will confine each Deputy to a ten-minute slot because it is not fair on other members if people go on at length.  If questions are not covered in the slot, there will be another opportunity to come back in.  I will be rigid on that time limit today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#RR00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I am joined by Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell, who are not witnesses but who will assist me with the documentation.  I have reviewed the transcript of my evidence to the committee on 2 February 2016 as requested.  I note the clarification from the Chairman to the effect that the focus of my contribution should be only on those areas where the record needs to be corrected.<\/p> <p>  In the interest of garnering as much information as possible to respond to the committee, I initiated an examination of the two matters referred to by the Chairman in his letter to me.  Whereas this examination had not fully concluded when my initial letter was sent to the committee on 16 March, in the interests of providing as much information and clarity to the committee as possible, the examination continued after my initial letter was sent.  Consequently, the committee will note that I sent a second letter to it on foot of further and better information.  I have sought to expand on those aspects of my contribution where issues were raised by the members of the committee as per the Chairman&rsquo;s letter.  I have limited my reply to the specific issues identified by the Chairman and I will focus my contribution on those matters.  Arising from my review of the transcripts, there is one other matter, while not raised specifically by the committee, that I wish to include in this response by way of providing additional clarity.  I wish to stress that the evidence provided by me to the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter has been given with the utmost of good faith and with the sole purpose of assisting the committee and its members in as much as I possibly could at those individual sittings.<\/p> <p>  As I highlighted to the committee on a number of occasions, the evidence I provided at three sittings in 2015 and 2016 on this matter was somewhat restricted for reasons outside my control.  Given that neither of the two reports - the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports - had been published at that time, I was attempting to answer questions and provide information to members while constrained by the fact that I could not speak openly on matters.  This, as Deputies are aware, was to avoid interfering with a live Garda investigation.  Consequently, words or phrases chosen by me during questioning by members to explain matters would not necessarily have been ones that I would have chosen had I had complete freedom to discuss the information contained within both reports.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the question of liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2012 on the matters concerned.  The HSE has been aware since 2011 of live Garda investigations into a number of cases relating to this former foster home.  Since that time, HSE staff at local level have been involved in ongoing engagement and liaison with senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been leading the investigation into this matter.  Liaison and engagement between the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved many forms, including meetings, the exchange of relevant correspondence and the provision of additional information and files to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as live investigations proceeded throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014.  By way of example, the Conal Devine report was provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2012 to further assist it with its ongoing investigations at that time.  In April 2013, HSE staff at local level were advised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they would retain files pertaining to Grace as there were, at that point, three further investigations being conducted as a direct result of the investigation into the case.<\/p><p>Later in August 2013, further files were sought formally in relation to these investigations.<\/p><p> Furthermore, throughout the years 2014 and 2015 there was considerable contact between AGS and the HSE------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#RR00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I take it AGS is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

That is what I mean.<br\/><br\/>That contact, in 2014 and 2015, through Resilience Ireland, was part of the &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry of the other 46 service users.  Part of this contact involved the development of an agreed protocol whereby no contact would be initiated with the families of the 46 service users until An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, AGS, had completed its interviews.  The HSE continued to receive updates on the live investigation from many channels, including AGS, local health staff and also through other official channels.<br\/><br\/>For the information of the committee, a schedule of engagements between local management and AGS, from 2011-2015, was enclosed with the letter as Appendix 1.<br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware that the Dignam report, paragraph 3.3.5, confirms ongoing liaison and engagement between the HSE and AGS where he states the following:<\/p><blockquote>There was clearly ongoing contact between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which members of the Inquiry Team were centrally involved.  For example, on the 27th March, 2014, Ms. O wrote to the relevant Superintendent in relation to a meeting arranged for the 1st April 2014, the purpose of which was stated to be &quot;to ensure that all relevant information available to the HSE is provided to Garda&iacute; in the context of the known investigation which you are currently undertaking in the context of a foster ... family in [named location].<\/blockquote> <p>At the commencement of the committee meeting on 9 March 2017, the Chairman referred to media reports indicating that communication between the HSE and AGS commenced in 2015.<br\/><br\/>As to the full extent of HSE-AGS liaison and engagement on this important matter, certain media reports over the past number of weeks have been incomplete.  The genesis of the media reports was information provided in response to a freedom of information, FOI, request.  The request was quite specific and sought, &quot;all correspondence between the HSE Social Care Division and the HSE Director General's Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the subject of the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland Reports&quot; from December 2014.<br\/><br\/>As set out in the schedule mentioned above, the liaison and engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between 2011 and 2015 was through the HSE's local office.  This correspondence did not come within the scope of the FOI request and therefore would not have been included in the material released.  Had the requester included the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and included HSE services at local level the information sought and provided would have allowed a more complete picture of the situation, and could have avoided some incorrect media headlines.<br\/><br\/>While much of the media coverage dealt with HSE contact with AGS surrounding the publication of the Devine report, for completeness it is important to state that the HSE, while aware of ongoing live investigations surrounding the former foster home, did not seek formal clearance to publish the two reports until February 2015.<br\/><br\/>The convention and standard practice throughout the HSE and the former health boards was that such reports would not be published while live Garda investigations were under way, in order to avoid interfering with AGS processes.  In the case of the Devine report, given that the HSE was made aware that live AGS investigations were under way, convention and standard practice was followed by the local HSE.<br\/><br\/>For specific reasons, in early 2015 the HSE chose to depart from this convention and standard practice in relation to these matters and, notwithstanding knowledge of a live AGS investigation, decided to proceed towards publication of both Devine and Resilience.  This decision was progressed for the following reasons: the HSE's awareness that AGS investigations were at that stage well advanced; the Resilience Ireland &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry report was close to completion and the considerable benefits of publishing both reports together; and an awareness of a significant public interest in the publication of both reports.<br\/><br\/>In this context, following considerable deliberation on the matter, on 24 February 2015 the HSE requested in writing that our legal advisers commence, on our behalf, the process of publication of both reports through formal engagement with AGS and other relevant bodies including the Information Commissioner and Wards of Courts Office.  In this regard, our legal advisers wrote to AGS on 6 March 2015 informing them of our intention to publish both reports in April 2015.  AGS responded to the HSE, through our legal advisers, on 14 April 2015 requesting us not to publish the reports.<br\/><br\/>Conor Dignam SC in his report, at paragraph 2.5.4.7, notes that in many cases reports should not be published if AGS are of a view that publication is likely to interfere with investigations.  He says, &quot;It is correct and proper, therefore, that the HSE and, indeed, the Minister, should afford considerable deference to the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when deciding whether the Reports should be published or not and it will properly be the case in very many, if not almost every case, that if the Garda&iacute; are of the view that a matter should not be published because it will interfere with a criminal investigation then it should not and will not be published by a public body.&quot;<br\/><br\/>At paragraph 2.5.4.0, Dignam notes that AGS would likely have taken a position against publication of these reports even if the HSE had sought approval at an earlier stage.  He states:<\/p><blockquote>However, it is only fair to point out that matters were not straightforward.  It is likely that even if the HSE had asked the Garda&iacute; at an earlier stage the Garda&iacute; would have expressed a concern at the impact on ongoing investigations.<\/blockquote> <p>Turning to the second area, the reference to the persons involved in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, in responding to questions I was doing my utmost to provide as much clarity as possible on this matter.  However, I was somewhat constrained as to the extent of information that I could provide on the basis that AGS had not - at that time - provided approval for the reports to be published and the risk of interfering with a live Garda investigation.  I was also conscious of not prejudicing individuals who may be subject to a HR process.<br\/><br\/>On many occasions during the course of hearings before the PAC, I highlighted the fact that I was constrained as to how much information I was in a position to provide at that time.<br\/><br\/>In responding to the specific question, I took into consideration two relevant sections of the Devine report, sections 4 and 5, in particular, section 4.4.15.  Consideration of both sections is important in order to have a full understanding of the significance of each person's role in the key decision events in 1996, in particular, the case conference that occurred in October 1996.<br\/><br\/>Section 4.4.15 on page 32 of the Devine report sets out the detail of the October 1996 case conference; those involved in same - numbering five people, the decisions made and the actions to be undertaken on foot of those decisions by the responsible professionals - numbering three people.<br\/><br\/>The information, as set out in section 4, confirms the decision that Grace was (a) to remain in the foster placement, (b) to continue in her day service, (c) responsibility for her care was to transfer to the adult disability services, and (d) a new key worker - from adult disability services - was to be assigned to her case as she would no longer be in the care of the foster care team.  The case conference also decided that any change in her circumstances would be reviewed by the adult disability services and that, significantly, they would progress making Grace a ward of court, the implementation of which was to be followed up by the new key worker.<br\/><br\/>What is important to note here is that of the five-person case conference, three people had an important dual function: (a) participation in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, and (b) carrying out a series of eight actions that needed to be taken in order to make the environment safe for Grace to remain there.<br\/><br\/>The following sections in the Devine report, that is, page 32 onwards, identify how these key actions were not followed up by some of the three individuals who were tasked with making Grace's environment safe.  In effect, this meant that the young woman was not made a ward of court, nor was her care appropriately followed up.  She remained with the family until she was removed in 2009.<\/p><p>When I mentioned &quot;a three-person panel, for want of a better word&quot; - that is on page 9, paragraph 8 of the transcript of 2 February 2016 in response to a member's question - it was the three individuals who had this important dual function: decision role and implementation of actions.  For the sake of clarity, this refers to H7, H3 and H12.<br\/><br\/>I went on to say: &quot;This was made by a three-person panel, for want of a better word, and those three persons are no longer in the public service to be clear about that.&quot;  It is the same section of the transcript.<br\/><br\/>The three persons to whom I referred - H7, H3 and H12 as per the Devine report - had all retired from the HSE on the date that I made this statement.  The HSE payroll system indicates that all three are in receipt of full HSE pensions.  This indicates that all three are retired from the public service.  It was on this basis that I stated, and believed, that the three persons - H7, H3 and H12 - were no longer in the public service.<br\/><br\/>On foot of the examination that I initiated, I would like to correct the record of the Committee in respect of H3 as follows: H3 retired from the HSE in 2012 and is in receipt of a full HSE pension that is recorded on HSE&rsquo;s pension-payroll system.  It was on this basis that I stated that H3 is retired from the public service also.  I have now established that H3 provides some specialist clinical services to Tusla on a part-time contract basis.  H3 provided a similar service to the former children and families service - part of the HSE until the end of 2013.  On the formal creation of Tusla in January 2014, any relationship between the HSE and H3 would have ceased.<br\/><br\/>This information came to my attention yesterday, Wednesday, 22 March, by way of the examination process that I initiated.  This examination was not straightforward as H3 possesses a number of payroll numbers, both pay and pension, across two organisations, within a financial-payroll system that is not sufficiently integrated to allow the many payroll numbers to be attributed to one person.  In light of information that I now have, I wish to correct the record of my information to the committee dated 2 February 2016 at page 9.  H3, while retired from the HSE, is currently in public service on a part-time basis in Tusla.  I wish to apologise to the committee for not being in a position to have had more complete information at the time in February 2016.<br\/><br\/>As stated by me during the course of that meeting:<\/p><blockquote>There are many people who were involved in different ways in those processes.  One of the features of this is the disagreements that occurred at different times as to what should have occurred and different people were on different sides of those disagreements.  Some of those people are still working in either the HSE or Tusla.<\/blockquote><p>That is from page 13.<br\/><br\/>I further commented at the same meeting: &quot;There are people who are referenced in those reports in many different ways who are currently employed either in the health service or in Tusla, as I said earlier&quot;.  In stating this, I was acknowledging that there are other people who were involved in aspects of decisions around Grace, both in 1996 and at other times, who currently work in the HSE or Tusla and who may face disciplinary action now that both reports have been published.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I refer to level of funding to the voluntary provider.  During the course of my opening statement last year on page 6, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with that organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding to which it was agreeable.  This independent external review by Deloitte is now nearing completion.  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#SS00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

I do not believe the issue of the two dates is the really important one.  I believe the events of 6 March happened because of the article in <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>on 22 February.

There is no credible reason for there being such a delay in asking the Garda whether the report could be published.  This should have been a request that was ongoing, or one being made all the time.  Because it had taken this length of time, all of a sudden, the heat was on in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and it was coming from the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  In fairness to both the print and broadcast media then and now, we would not be sitting here were it not for them.  They have done us all a good service.  That was the motivation.  Mr. O'Brien said quite diligently and proudly that he had not received the information on the disclosure until 10 March.  I will check the record, but I am sure it was 10 March.

At that stage, the report in question was the Conal Devine report.

When Dignam later reported, he said there were considerable issues around procurement.

Consequently we have accepted the conclusions of Mr. Conor Dignam SC, that it would be appropriate to ensure that what had been custom and practice was properly reflected in the internal regulations.  He also accepted that the circumstances in this case were such as to amount to exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the procurement policy and the National Financial Regulations Act of the HSE, thereby permitting a derogation from normal procedures.  He then says:<\/p><blockquote>It does seem to me that the HSE was justified of derogating from the normal process and in those circumstances was not obliged to engage in a tender process.  Indeed I agree with the HSE submission that such a tender process would probably have been inappropriate and unworkable given the subject matter.  There was therefore no inadequacy in relation to complying with the relevant procurement rules, arising from the fact that the contract was not the subject of an open tender.  One can readily see why such a process would have been wholly inappropriate.<\/blockquote> <p>He also says later on, and I cannot quote the precise words right now, in relation to Dignam that it represented fair value for money. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>On reports that have stayed on the shelf and were not acted on in any respect, I want to focus clearly on this -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>Can I just say ------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I do not want to stray into -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02600","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>It did not just stay on the shelf.

He has at least clarified the original question he was asked by Deputy Deasy, notwithstanding Mr. O'Brien's contention that he had a view that the Deputy was talking about other people or at least that Mr. O'Brien had different people in his mind, which is hard to understand.  Anyway, we have dealt with that now.  I have two simple, direct questions for Mr. O'Brien before I conclude, as I want to let other people in.  I still find it hard to understand and it beggars belief that so much time passed from the point the Devine report was furnished to the HSE and the time Mr. O'Brien says today a decision was made in February 2015 to put in place or in train a query to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether the HSE could publish the report.  It is incredible it was not done before then.  From 2012 to that date, the report sat on a shelf.  The reason it sat on a shelf is because the HSE let it sit on a shelf.  That chimes with what many people allege, which is that there was a cover-up within the HSE, because they cannot understand why the report was not published.  Mr. O'Brien says the report was not published because of standard practice but that is not what he said when he was before the committee in the past.  I want him clearly to answer the question as to why he did not seek the advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to March 2015 and why the report was left sitting on a shelf for that time period.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the funding issue that was asked about recently.  My understanding is that there has been no contact within the local office of the HSE and the service providers.  If that is inaccurate, can Mr. O'Brien point out the level of interaction and engagement with the local office and the service providers in question with regard to funding and whether there is still an outstanding issue or dispute regarding the funding?  Specifically, I ask about the contact between the local office and the service providers.  Those are two clear questions and I will finish on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#EEE02700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>I will answer the Deputy's questions.  I preface that by saying it is not accurate to say the Devine report has sat on a shelf.  It was provided to the Garda at the time and the recommendations within it were being implemented even while it was not published.  As I told the Deputy earlier in respect of the period before the approach to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in February 2015, the HSE was doing exactly what it and the health boards had previously done in situations where there were live Garda investigations.  It is often described as \"first principles\" that one would not expect to publish a report which might have an adverse bearing on a Garda investigation.  I remind the Deputy, if I may, of the extracts I quoted from the Dignam report which described that approach in particular in the context of the advice received as a perfectly reasonable one.  Also, the view was put forward that if any earlier request for the written advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been made, it was reasonable to suppose that exactly the same response would have been received.<\/p><p>When I gave evidence here in 2016, I was referring to the reality, which is documented, that from the point at which I initiated proceedings to get the formal advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was strongly objecting to the publication of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#EEE02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>Can I make one point?

That is very honest of Mr. O'Brien.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider what Dignam said about the report.  In 2009 the HSE set up the Devine inquiry to investigate the case of Grace, omitting the other 46 allegations.  The Dignam report stated \"the adoption of Terms of Reference by the HSE which led to this focus, means that the approach adopted to the Inquiry by the HSE was inadequate in all the circumstances.\"  These inadequate terms of reference were designed by the designated person from the serious incident management team in line with procedure.  This person was referenced previously in other evidence; his name is Ger Crowley.  He helped set up the terms of reference for the Devine inquiry into the Grace case and was centrally involved.<\/p> <p>  He then retired from the HSE and set up Resilience Ireland.  That organisation then got a contract to do a desktop review of the 46 others left out of the terms of reference of the Devine inquiry for which he was already involved in setting up the terms of reference.  He subsequently retired, which is fine, and then was part of an organisation, as a director.  He got the contract to do the work.  He recommended a further review, that is, visiting the other 46 cases.  Then, subsequently, his company got the contract to do this work.  However, the Dignam report found that there was no reason not to get three quotes.  Of course, the argument Mr. O'Brien made and will subsequently make after answering this question, I am sure, is that this was because the HSE was in a hurry etc.  While the HSE might not have got three quotes - Mr. O'Brien outlined the culture that existed - did it get even one quote for the work?

However, we can never forget the role Mr. McGuinness played in bringing peace to this island through his negotiation skills and willingness to partake in the very delicate and difficult process leading to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and, indeed, his continued work since then to ensure its implementation.  It is up to all of us, North and South, to ensure that the legacy of that good work continues.

We particularly convey our condolences to the families of the four people killed and our sincere hopes and prayers for a speedy recovery for all those injured.  An Irish person is among the injured.  I propose that the committee should write to the British Ambassador to Ireland, Robin Barnett, expressing our abhorrence of this terrorist attack and conveying our sympathies to our colleagues in the British Parliament, a number of whom were here yesterday at a meeting of the Good Friday Agreement committee at which we discussed Brexit and outlined the difficulties we had and what we wanted to see arising from Brexit.

I welcome this opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence, to consider the 2017 Revised Estimates for Vote 35, Army Pensions and Vote 36, Defence.  I have a short opening statement which will set out the overall position and update the members on some of the main developments within the defence sector over recent times.  Before I conclude my opening statement, I will refer to the tragic events related to the loss of Rescue 116 off the west coast.  <\/p><p>The defence sector is made up of two votes &ndash; Vote 35, Army Pensions and Vote 36, Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to <i>&quot;provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government&rsquo;&quot;.  <\/i>Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.  The combined Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions for 2017 provides for gross expenditure of some &euro;922 million.<\/p><p>The Defence Vote of &euro;692 million includes a pay and allowances allocation of some &euro;497 million, while the remaining non-pay allocation of &euro;195 million provides mainly for the renewal and maintenance of essential equipment, infrastructure and operational costs.<\/p><p> The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2017 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;230 million for the Army pensions Vote.  More than &euro;220 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.<\/p><p> Having outlined the broad financial parameters of both Votes, I will now address some of the main features of the single programme on the Defence Vote, programme A, defence policy and support, military capabilities and operational outputs.<\/p><p> The defence pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of a Permanent Defence Force strength of up to 9,500, 550 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 Army nurses.  This level of funding provides the defence organisation with the resources necessary for it to deliver effectively on all its key domestic and international responsibilities.<\/p><p> An ongoing and increasing level of recruitment has been taking place within the Defence Forces in recent years.  To this end, I recently launched the 2017 recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces which targets the induction of some 860 new entrants across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service this year.  Permanent Defence Force strengths are not yet at the target levels.  However, funding is in place, and this year's recruitment programme highlights my commitment to a Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500.  These recruits will avail of the highest levels of training and, in return, the Defence Forces will benefit through the injection of energy and enthusiasm, which every organisation, particularly the Defence Forces, needs.  Promotions are also ongoing, with over 1,400 promotions across all areas of the Defence Forces since 2014.<\/p><p> The budget allocation also provides for a Reserve Defence Force, RDF, pay allocation of more than &euro;2 million which will provide for 26,000 training days in 2017.  I acknowledge and appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of the RDF members who provide voluntary service throughout the country and I welcome the fact that this allocation provides a minimum of seven days' annual paid training for all effective members of the reserve, as well as providing for 14 days' paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the reserve in 2017.  In line with RDF priorities, this will also facilitate selected members to participate in career and specialist courses, as required.<\/p><p> The defence non-pay allocation comprises current and capital elements.  The current expenditure allocation of &euro;121 million provides mainly for expenditure on essential and ongoing Defence Forces' standing and operational costs, such as those relating to utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.<\/p><p> The capital expenditure allocation of &euro;74 million provides for the necessary procurement and upgrading of defensive equipment and infrastructure and represents a welcome increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 defence allocation contained in the capital investment programme for the period 2016 to 2021.  This increase is essential to ensure that the Defence Forces have the necessary levels of equipment in place to allow them to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.  Among the main equipment programme priorities planned for 2017 are the continuation of the naval vessel replacement programme; the armoured personnel carrier, APC, mid-life extension programme; the aircraft replacement programme; the purchase of armoured utility vehicles; and the acquisition of armoured logistic vehicles for overseas missions.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces built infrastructure allocation of &euro;14 million has increased significantly over the 2016 position and will facilitate continuing infrastructural developments across military locations.  A number of projects are planned for 2017, which are progressing on a phased basis, to upgrade and maintain the infrastructure essential for the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> Last year, in the context of the 2016 Estimates, I informed the committee that a contract had been signed with Babcock International for the provision of a fourth ship under the naval vessel replacement programme at a cost of &euro;67 million.  I am delighted to say that significant progress has been made since, and on 28 February last I attended the keel-laying ceremony at Babcock's shipbuilding yard in Devon, where I announced that the ship would bear the name of the renowned Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw.  Payments of &euro;28 million under this contract are scheduled for 2017, and by 2018 the naval vessel replacement programme will have delivered four new ships at a cost of some &euro;266 million.  The naval vessel replacement programme represents excellent value for money, and these ships will be of major benefit to the State and a further significant enhancement of defence capabilities.  The acquisition of these new ships has facilitated the participation of the Naval Service in its deployment to assist with rescue missions arising from the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.  To date, these missions have led to the rescue of more than 15,600 migrants.<\/p><p> Last year, I commissioned the new Defence Forces International Operational Service Medal to recognise the service of Defence Forces personnel who have been deployed on overseas missions by direction of the Government where no other mission medal has been awarded.  This medal was awarded to all personnel who took part in search-and-rescue activities in the Mediterranean during 2015 and 2016.<\/p><p> I will now briefly outline some of the key roles and outputs delivered under the defence programme.  The Defence Forces continue to make a considerable contribution in their international peace and security role, and at 1 March 2017 Ireland was contributing 585 Defence Forces personnel to ten different missions across the globe.  In addition, personnel are deployed to a range of international organisations and national representations.<\/p><p> The main overseas mission on which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 378 personnel.  Since 22 November 2016, when Ireland assumed the lead of the joint battalion in UNIFIL from Finland, Ireland's contribution to UNIFIL has increased by some 150 personnel.  Ireland is also contributing 136 personnel to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in the Golan Heights.  I have already referenced the contribution made by the Naval Service in its deployment to the Mediterranean, and the issue of a further deployment in 2017 will be considered shortly.<\/p><p> The Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for Ireland's domestic security, supported, as required, by the Defence Forces as part of their aid to the civil power function.  This role is multifaceted and in 2016 included a varied set of tasks such as Garda air support missions, Central Bank security guards, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal call-outs and Naval Service diving operations.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces also provide assistance to the principal response agencies tasked with responding to major emergencies.  By way of example, in 2016, the Defence Forces were deployed on a number of missing persons searches, the Naval Service conducted fisheries boardings and the Air Corps undertook a number of emergency aeromedical support missions.  The professional competence shown by the Defence Forces in undertaking these roles is greatly valued and appreciated by all stakeholders.<\/p><p> Last year was of huge historical importance and, in this context, I express my sincere gratitude to the Defence Forces for their outstanding contribution to the many ceremonial events undertaken.  Their input contributed significantly to numerous ceremonial highlights throughout 2016, with the full military display involving 2,500 military personnel undertaken on Easter Sunday, rightly receiving universal acclaim for its dignified, respectful and inclusive salute to our historic past.  I feel it was only right and fitting, therefore, as part of the Ireland 2016 centenary programme and in line with the programme for Government commitment, that all serving members of the Defence Forces were presented with a specially commissioned medal to mark their role in these ceremonies.<\/p><p> Civil Defence is also funded from the defence Vote and remains a vital component within each local authority's emergency response arrangements.  During 2016, Civil Defence volunteers provided ongoing support and front-line emergency assistance at many commemorative events throughout the country.  In recognition of their efforts, I commissioned a specially-designed medal to be presented to all members of Civil Defence who were in active service between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016.<\/p><p> Finally, I turn to programme A, provision for Defence Forces' pensions benefits, of Vote 35.  Expenditure under Vote 35 is demand-driven and non-discretionary, with superannuation benefits - pensions and gratuities - and disability pensions, etc., accounting for 99% of all expenditure.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.<\/p><p>Some 2,700 military personnel have retired on pensions from January 2010 to date and currently 12,250 pensioners are paid from the Army pensions Vote.  There is a net increase of 1,250 since 2007.  All the indications are that this underlying trend will be maintained in the coming years.  For the years 2017 to 2019, inclusive, current projections are that 1,000 military personnel will retire on pension.  Last year, 2016, saw 330 Defence Forces members retire on pension, with a similar number anticipated in 2017.  As the committee is aware, it has been my stated intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall budgetary negotiations, and some progress has been made on that front.  As announced in budget 2017, the gross allocation for Army pensions has been increased by &euro;6 million to &euro;230 million for this year, a welcome change.<\/p><p> I have broadly outlined the key inputs, outputs and performance indicators for the defence sector.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on the individual subheads for the Defence and Army pensions Estimates.  I look forward to positive engagement on any issues the committee may wish to discuss.<\/p><p> Before I conclude I want to comment on the tragic events off the west coast.  I want to express my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Chief Pilot Mark Duffy, winchman Paul Ormsby and winchman Ciar&aacute;n Smith - the crew involved in this tragic incident - as well as to the staff of the Irish Coast Guard.  I recognise the efforts of everyone involved in the recovery operation in a dangerous environment.  In particular, I acknowledge the Defence Forces personnel who are assisting with the recovery operation through the provision of Naval Service ships and Air Corps aircraft.  Naval Service divers are also contributing their skills to the rescue mission.  It is important that those involved in the investigation process are given time and space to complete their work and to establish the full facts of this tragic event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#A00100","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

No members of the Irish Defence Forces are in Afghanistan at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the RDF.  First, I recognise the value of the important work that the Reserve Defence Force has played and continues to play in contributing to Ireland's defence capability.  As I have said on previous occasions, I admire the voluntary service of the members to the Defence Forces.  I am the first to recognise that 2017 was not the greatest year for recruiting members to the RDF.  I was listening to committee hearings recently and this was one of the major issues raised.  Having said that, I reassure the Deputy that the members of the RDF play an important role.  That much was stated in the White Paper published in 2015.  The White Paper commits to the retention and development of the Reserve Defence Force.  I acknowledge the problems around the inducting and recruitment of the reserve.<\/p> <p>  I have made this a priority during 2017.  I was appointed in May 2016.  There was not a great deal of change at that stage.  From the time of my appointment there were issues up until the end of 2016, especially issues relating to induction.  I have had conversations and meetings with the Secretary General and his assistants.  I have also met the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff to ensure this is made a priority in 2017 and to ensure we get in the required number.  There are issues around inducting personnel relating to Garda clearance and security.  We are recruiting for the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  As members are aware, every organisation has issues around Garda checks and security and so on.  I have to ensure all safety checks and security checks have been carried out effectively on all people who have been recruited to the Reserve Defence Force.  Having said that, this is a priority for me for 2017.  There were issues in 2016 and I want to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#C00600","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy.

This is probably indicative of the fact that we are losing people at an alarming rate.  This has been discussed at previous meetings.  I note the efforts of the Department and the RDF to increase recruitment.  There are still a number of problems.  It is not progressing at the rate it should be.<\/p> <p>  In terms of man-days allocated, while there are an initial seven days of paid training and up to a further 28 days of paid training for each reservist upon application by his or her unit, the lack of flexibility in those man-days is a difficulty.  There may be individuals in the unit who are able to give more than 28 days.  In the spirit of volunteerism, I do not see the difficulty with that.  During my time in the RDF, it was a lot easier to do additional man-days if one had the ability to volunteer more of one's time, whether that was because one had lost a job, was unemployed, in college or for any other reason.  At certain times during their lives, people have more time to give to the organisation and that should be welcomed.  However, there is no flexibility.  When a unit is assigned a certain number of man-days, it often hands back almost half of them because those that are able to give active service that year use up their man-days and they are unable to access any more.  A little change like that would make a big difference.  The estimated spend on the RDF for 2016 was &euro;2.1 million.  We only actually spent &euro;1.5 million.  The money is there.  We are really short on bodies.  It is difficult to run a training camp or a course if people cannot attend.  If we provided more flexibility in respect of man-days so that those that are able to give more time are allowed to give more time and units can allocate those man-days more freely, it would go a long way towards addressing some of the problems within the individual units.  That one small change would have a massive impact.<\/p> <p>  A number of years ago reservists received what was called a gratuity payment.  It was not big money.  In the region of &euro;600 was paid to each reservist around Christmas time if he or she had completed his or her two weeks of annual training that year.  Not every reservist would qualify.  When a reservist goes on a training camp or a course for a week or two he or she is taking time out of his or her civilian employment.  Therefore, his or her salary or wages are down or he or she is taking a week's holidays.  Reservists' pay is then taxed quite heavily.  People at the rank of sergeant or higher come out with maybe &euro;200 after a week's training.  These people pay for fuel to get to and from the location.  They often purchase their own equipment.  We know the difficulties in terms of personal protective equipment, PPE.  A lot of reservists purchase their own boots, their own warm gear and their own wet gear.  The gratuity payment at the end of the year meant reservists bore the cost of the training camp earlier in the year.  Volunteering should not be so costly.  It now costs people to be a member of the RDF.  The gratuity payment is small money in terms of defence spending but it was a thank you payment for the effort put in by those who had done the required training and service during the year.  Again, this would be a minor change for small money.  It is raised time and time again by every reservist that I talk to.  The State showing their appreciation for the volunteerism displayed by members of the RDF would mean a lot to them.<\/p> <p>  I join with the Minister of State, the Department, the Defence Forces and the committee in offering my deepest sympathies to the families of Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith.  It is an absolute tragedy.  I appreciate that the rescue and search efforts are still ongoing.  I wholeheartedly commend the efforts of every organisation taking part in the search.  It is fantastic and amazing to see the different agencies working together using their expertise and the available equipment to make the best effort we can as a State.  It is important to note the efforts of locals in the Erris region.  Local fishermen have been on site conducting the search efforts as best they can and local people have been providing food, warm drinks and assistance in whatever way they can.  It has been an amazing community effort in that area.  As a representative from County Mayo, I know it has hit the community there very hard.  It will leave a lasting mark on our community.<\/p> <p>  In the briefing documents supplied, it is noted that the operational flight hours of the Air Corps in 2014 were 5,009.  In 2016 they dropped to 4,286.  Why have they been reduced?  I doubt there is a need to reduce the hours.  Is it down to a lack of resources and capabilities?  In light of recent reports which confirm the inadequate resourcing of Defence Forces units, such as those involving pilots and air traffic controllers, what measures is the Department taking to resolve the manpower shortages being experienced by the Air Corps?  This is not something that has been discovered in the past few weeks.  The issue of resourcing and manpower shortages in the Air Corps has been known for quite some time.  It must be addressed with absolute urgency.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the issue of the health concerns of those who were in contact with hazardous material a number of years ago.  Has the Minister of State had an opportunity to consider whether it might be prudent for the Department and the State to conduct a health review of those that feel they were affected and may possibly have experienced adverse health effects due to their contact with hazardous chemicals?  This was done in Australia when a similar situation occurred there.  An appropriate health package could be put in place for affected individuals.<\/p> <p>  I have asked the question previously, but I would like to get an update from the Minister of State and the Department as to whether the potential impact of Brexit in terms of defence policy and our Defence Forces has been analysed?  What are the Department's preparations for Brexit?<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister of State has been contacted, as have many of us, by those involved in the Jadotville siege and their families.  There is huge unhappiness and disappointment at the manner in which the issue of the service medals was dealt with.  Would the Minister of State seek the establishment, under the Defence Forces regulations, of a board of military officers to review the recommendations made in the original 2004 review of the events at Jadotville?  Perhaps they reached the right conclusion.  It is not for me to decide or judge.  I can tell the Minister of State that I have been inundated with representations on this issue.  I do not see the difficulty in looking back at the decision taken in 2004 and assessing whether the right call was made.  If not, we can address that.  It would be in the interests of the citizens of the State, those that served during that time and their family members.  There is no shame in saying that the wrong call was made.  Perhaps it was not.  I do not see the difficulty in looking back to see if we did the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#D00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1532,"content":"<p>Deputy Lisa Chambers asked about service medals and Jadotville in particular.  In recognition of the mission in Jadotville and the contribution that members of the Irish Defence Forces made, I made this a priority when I came into the Department.  This issue has gone on for many years and has been dealt with by many Ministers.  I have asked the Chief of Staff to see what records there are relating to the battle of Jadotville in order to discover if we can recognise the soldiers' work and commitment during their mission.<\/p><p>Deputy Chambers will be well aware as a former member of the Reserve Defence Force of the regulations around medals and that has to be respected also.  I assure the Deputy that this matter is ongoing within my own Department and within the Defence Forces.  We will continue to examine whether they can be awarded some form of medal.  Personally, I would not like to see just three or four people getting medals.  We have to recognise all the members who made a contribution to Jadotville because they all made a huge contribution in their own way.<\/p><p> On Brexit, colleagues will be aware that the Prime Minister of the UK said she will trigger Article 50 shortly, although I am not sure if that will happen because of events yesterday.  That is a matter for the British Government.  Let me assure the Deputy that I have assigned a senior person within my Department to deal with all Brexit-related matters.  This person is supported by a number of others in all branches within the Department and the Defence Forces.  The managing board is also acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight of all issues that are arising at present.  I and senior officials within my Department have had a number of meetings with the Department of the Taoiseach.   Once Article 50 is moved upon and the negotiations begin, we will be very much involved and will be ready.<\/p><p> Regarding the issues around the Air Corps, as the Deputy well knows and as I have stated on numerous occasions, there is a shortage of pilots.  That is an issue I am trying to address but it cannot be addressed overnight.  We have eight cadets going through at the moment and pilots coming on each year.  It takes five years before a pilot is fully trained up and qualified to fly any form of aircraft.  I am addressing the issue but it will take quite some time to get back to full strength.  That is the reason there has been a lowering of flying hours within the Air Corps.<\/p><p> On the Reserve Defence Force, as I stated to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan before she left, this a priority for me in 2017.  I know Deputy Chambers asked for specifics around training days, the spending of the budget, the gratuity payment and so on.  One thing I do not want to lose is the whole voluntary ethos around the Reserve Defence Force.  People join for the right reasons when they join as volunteers.  I do not want people to lose that special ethos.  I will look at the issues the Deputy raised around the gratuity.<\/p><p> On the number of training days, during 2016, a total of 1,298 Reserve personnel undertook paid training days and a total of 19,710 training man days were used up.  Similarly to the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive, not all of the allocation of 2016 was used up.  This is reflected in an underspend of &euro;582,000 in the Reserve budget in 2016.  The Deputy raised specific issues about whether we can use up the underspend or savings.  I will examine the matter.  I have spoken to senior people in my Department, the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff about how we can improve the terms and conditions, recruitment and everything relating to the Reserve.  I want to make sure this is prioritised in 2017.  Even though we have a great number of people applying for the Reserve, when it comes to having the medical exams and things like that, many people fall off.  I want to find out if the process is taking so long that we are losing people.  I am not sure what the issues are in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#D00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1534,"content":"<p>I have a couple of follow-up questions.  The Minister of State did not answer my question about the health review and the hazardous materials at Casement Aerodrome.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the gratuity payment, there is no fear of losing the voluntary ethos.  This payment was always there.  It was only taken away when the country hit crisis point and we had to save money.  As somebody who has served in the Reserve, I can tell the Minister that it is quite an expensive thing to do.  It costs money to be a member.  People are paying for equipment and taking time off work.  The gratuity payment just balanced it out.  Restoring it would not affect the volunteerism.  The issue is coming up all the time.  No one is in the Reserve for the money - I guarantee the Minister that.  It is a minor amount of money which people would only get if they did their two weeks' training.  They have taken the financial hit with their two weeks' training; they have taken time off work, lost their wages and are getting taxed heavily.  When I was in the Reserve in the early days, the payment used to come at the end of the training period.  Then it changed and people got it at the end of the year.  That did not make a huge amount of difference, and people were fine about getting it at the end of the year.  It helped balance out the cost of being in the organisation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the man days, all I am suggesting is that many days are being handed back and there are people who would take them on.  I am not suggesting the Minister gives a serving member - man or woman - the ability to do six months in the Reserve Defence Force and make a career out of it.  A period of 28 days is quite restrictive.  If someone does a two week training course such as a career course, as a corporal or sergeant, and then wants to do the two weeks' annual training in the summer, they cannot then do the Easter or winter camp.  It is just the basic weeks of training.  It is difficult for any unit, particularly in rural communities, to get the numbers to turn up.  People have different things going on in their lives.  When we have people active and willing to give the extra time, it is very difficult to run a camp if only five people turn up and there are others sitting at home who would love to go and cannot.  A bit of flexibility is needed.  I ask the Minister to increase the 28 days by adding an extra two or three weeks.  That is not a huge amount but it would allow units to use the man days that they have.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has asked us to give him recommendations.

A powerful presentation was made to the committee about this recently and I am sure the Minister has read the transcript.  Many issues were raised but one was that if people are in receipt for a social welfare payment and do the training, the payment ceases but they are not paid for the duration of training, which is a considerable time.  Losing a few weeks income when someone is on a low income is not acceptable.  I pointed out that day that cheques for personnel in the Department, the Permanent Defence Force and ourselves are in our bank accounts at the end of every month.  It is not acceptable that people on low incomes should have to wait a number of weeks to resume social welfare payments.  That seems to be a case of bad administration within the Department if the way I took the issue up is accurate.  Surely there is a way to amend that.  If a person completes a week's training, there should not be a delay in his or her payment.  Others members and I have outlined previously to the Minister of State the value we attach to the RDF.  I instanced many young people where I come from who would have been vulnerable were it not the opportunity they were given in the Reserve to participate and play a good role in society.<\/p> <p>  Three Bills - the Red Cross Bill, the Defences Forces (forensic evidence) Bill and the Defence (amendment) Bill - seem to be going backwards every year.

When Operation Pontus began in 2015 we had 1,204 patrol days and in 2016 when the operation continued we were able to proceed with 1,376 patrol days.  A total of 1,079 fishery vessel boardings were carried out in 2015 and 1,249 in 2016.  We work very closely with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, regarding patrol days and fishery vessel boardings.

The report for 2015 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 September 2016 and the following motion has been placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2015, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 September 2016, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006.<\/blockquote> <p>In commending the motion, I will outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the UN over the past couple of years.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland reaffirmed this commitment in the Government's most recent White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.  The White Paper on Defence sets out the policy framework for the defence organisation until 2025 and beyond.<\/p><p>Ireland's commitment to the United Nations has found expression in its longstanding tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, a service which has comprised over 65,000 individual tours of duty.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU.  During 2015, the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN led and UN authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on nine different missions throughout the world, in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  In addition, members of the Permanent Defence Force were also deployed on humanitarian missions in Sierra Leone and in the Mediterranean in 2015.  Ireland's main commitments during 2015 were to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment.<\/p><p>Following a request from the United Nations, a contingent of Defence Forces personnel was deployed to UNIFIL in mid-2011.  Between June 2012 and November 2013, Ireland served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion when a contingent of the Finnish Armed Forces began serving alongside Irish soldiers working to support UNIFIL's mission mandate.  Also, Ireland held command of the joint Irish-Finnish battalion during that period.  Finland, in accordance with agreements entered into on the deployment of the joint battalion, assumed command on 26 November 2013.  Since May 2015, the Finnish battalion has included an Estonian platoon.  Throughout 2015, a contingent comprising approximately 200 Defence Forces personnel was deployed to the UNIFIL mission.  There were two rotations of Irish personnel to UNIFIL in 2015 comprising the 49th Infantry Group and the 51st Infantry Group, each with approximately 185 personnel.  Also, a number of Defence Forces personnel served at UNIFIL sector west headquarters in Shama and at the force headquarters in Naqoura.<\/p><p>Partnership with like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  The joint participation of Ireland, Finland and Estonia in the UNIFIL mission is but one example that demonstrates our joint contribution to international peace and security.  In the absence of partners, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be notably curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability, build experience, significantly contribute to the range and nature of operations we can undertake in support of the United Nations and further deepen the excellent relationship between our countries.<\/p><p>Ireland formally took over command of the Irish-Finnish battalion on 22 November 2016, at which time an additional company of approximately 150 personnel were deployed as part of the battalion.  This brings the current number of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL up to some 380.  An Irish officer, Major General Michael Beary, took over as head of mission and force commander of UNIFIL in July 2016.  At the request of the UN, his appointment has been extended until July 2018.  It is a great honour for our country to have Major General Beary occupying this prestigious post and is an indication of the high regard in which Irish personnel are held internationally.  It has been 30 years since an Irish person last held this post.  The situation in Lebanon continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security.  In this connection, the United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2017.<\/p><p>Ireland's second largest overseas deployment in 2015 was to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The Defence Forces contribution to UNDOF in 2015 comprised the 48th Infantry Group and the 50th Infantry Group, each of which consists of approximately 130 personnel.  The Infantry Group operated in the role of a quick reaction force on stand-by to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF area of responsibility.  There were eight Defence Forces personnel occupying staff appointments at UNDOF's Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  At the request of the UN, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon had his appointment as deputy force commander of UNDOF extended to 21 May 2016.  I take this opportunity to thank Brigadier General Hanlon for his contribution to the success of the mission and wish him every success in the future. <\/p><p>The security situation in UNDOF's area of operations is continually reviewed by the UN and the Defence Forces.  The continued presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region and is supported and welcomed by both Syria and Israel.  Ireland continued to contribute military observers and staff to various United Nations missions such as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, throughout the year under review.  The 13 Irish personnel deployed to that mission in 2015 included the head of mission and Chief of Staff of UNTSO, Major General Michael Finn.  Major General Finn was appointed head of mission of UNTSO by the UN in July 2013 and had his appointment extended for a further period until the end of July 2015.  I thank Major General Finn for his contribution to the success of the mission and wish him every success in the future.  At the request of the United Nations, an Irish officer, Colonel Eamon Caulfield, was appointed as deputy chief of staff of UNTSO in September 2015.<\/p><p>I have just returned from a visit to the Middle East where I visited personnel serving with the UN missions in Lebanon and Israel.<\/p><p>I also attended St Patrick's Day events in the region as part of Ireland's overall economic, political and security engagement in the region.  It was a valuable opportunity to be briefed on the position and the challenges facing the respective missions in the area.<br\/><br\/>During 2015, Defence Forces officers continued to serve with MINURSO, the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara; MONUSCO, the UN stabilisation mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and UNOCl, the UN operation in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire.  Ireland contributed ten personnel to the EU training mission in Mali in 2015.  The objective of the mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian armed forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian state.  In October 2016, I had an opportunity to meet Irish personnel serving with the mission.  Currently, 18 Irish Defence Forces personnel are deployed with the mission.  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2015 were the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with seven personnel; the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 12 personnel; and the resolute support mission, RSM, in Afghanistan, with seven personnel.  The personnel serving with RSM completed their service on 10 March 2016, when Ireland withdrew from the mission.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the deployment of Defence Forces personnel to humanitarian missions in 2015, three Naval Service vessels were deployed to the Mediterranean between May and November of that year to assist the Italian authorities with the migrant crisis.  Irish participation in the humanitarian mission resulted in the rescue of more than 8,500 migrants, which clearly demonstrates the value of Ireland's involvement in this important humanitarian response.  I had the opportunity to travel to Sardinia in September 2016 to meet Naval Service personnel crewing <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>and be briefed on the mission.  I commend all involved in 2015 and 2016 on the outstanding role they played in saving the lives of so many men, women and children, many of whom were fleeing desperate circumstances.  Five Defence Forces personnel were also deployed to Sierra Leone in January 2015 where they served as part of a UK-led joint inter-agency task force tackling Ebola in west Africa.  The Defence Forces completed their service with that mission on 15 September 2015.<br\/><br\/>The current contribution of 585 personnel to overseas missions is a very significant contribution in the context of the resources available for defence.  It reflects the Government's continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  It is important for Ireland to continue to build on our long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel to peace support operations.  Relative to our size and our available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.  Overseas service has become a core activity of the Defence Forces.  Ireland's record of service in UN-authorised peace support operations is second to none.  The Defence Forces have made and continue to make a significant contribution to such operations throughout the world.  The Government places high importance on the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  During my visit to the UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNTSO missions last week and my visit to Sardinia in September 2016 and to EUTM Mali in October 2016, I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.  I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  I assure the committee that the Government is committed to ensuring the Defence Forces continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the significant demands placed on personnel who serve overseas and specifically on their families.  Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas under the auspices of the United Nations would not be possible.  Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well, not alone on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole, and contributes to the excellent reputation that Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world.  I commend the motion to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#H01000","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee I record our appreciation of the very significant role played by so many members of the Permanent Defence Force in overseas missions.

They also play a role in service to the State.<\/p> <p>  This has a twofold benefit for the State.  It is a proud tradition and it is good that we make a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace.  After all, we are international citizens and it is important we live up to our obligations and responsibilities in this regard.  There is no doubt that our participation in overseas missions by our soldiers greatly enhances the professional capacity and capabilities of the Defence Forces, which is not to be underestimated.  It is a fantastic opportunity for our personnel to travel overseas and gain international experience working with other armed forces, learning and building knowledge all the time.  I can see nothing but good coming from our participation in United Nations missions, so I look forward to our continued participation in such missions in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#J00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>I was late coming here this morning but I will be brief.  I concur with the comments of Deputy Chambers and the Chairman and I fully support our troops serving around the world in the name of the United Nations.  It is a long-term duty and people spend six months abroad.  It is worrying for families when they see in what countries these people could serve and the changing circumstances around the world.  We have just seen what happened in England and, having spoken to families, I know people are getting more worried.  I know Irish soldiers are very well respected abroad, which is great.  Anywhere we go, we always hear of the great respect that Irish soldiers enjoy.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions.  What is the total cost to the Irish taxpayer of all the missions serving abroad?

There was reference to the motion being placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I respectfully suggest we seek some time, even if it is an hour or two, for the motion to be debated in the D&aacute;il.  Very often, there is ignorance of what the Defence Forces are about, the comprehensive duties they perform throughout the world and the reputation they have gained for the work they do.  It benefits Ireland's reputation as well but it is very often forgotten.  People ask why we have Defence Forces but there is a role we play in peacekeeping and promoting Ireland as a country that is concerned about the rest of the world.  We are not just a little island in the Atlantic.  We should not hide our light under a bushel on this issue.  I would like to see time being given in the D&aacute;il Chamber, allowing the Minister of State to present a formal report from this committee.  It can be very rewarding.<\/p> <p>  There are small missions in different parts of the world, involving five, 12 or 20 people, which are so important for Ireland.  The positive input of the Irish Defence Forces in promoting peace and stability cannot be bought.  People often ask why we have the Defence Forces but this is every reason we have them.  We spend enough money on other issues.<\/p><p>Every penny we spend on the Defence Forces is worthwhile, even to promote Ireland's role in peacekeeping.  At a time when the world is upside down and there are conflicts all around it, it is important to tell it that there is a little country called Ireland which is helping to keep and promote peace.  I congratulate the Minister of State on what is a comprehensive report.  It should be placed on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il and time allocated to debate it.  We should not be afraid to promote the Defence Forces at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#J00500","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1578,"content":"<p>Our remit is to consider the report.  We cannot make recommendations, but perhaps each of us might recommend to our party Whip that we have a debate on the report.  There would be a clear message and recognition of the work done by so many during the years.  I know some families, three generations of which have served on overseas missions.  Three and four members of one family have served with distinction abroad.  Deputy Lisa Chambers and I will speak to our party Whip and perhaps the Minister of State and Deputies Se&aacute;n Barrett and Noel Grealish might do the same because it is extremely we have a debate.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to the successful co-operation between the Irish and Finnish defence forces.

In 2014 the cost was &euro;28 million.  We got back &euro;6.1 million from the United Nations.  When salaries and every other expense were taken out, the cost was &euro;9.9 million.  In 2015, after taking everything out, including the UN contribution, the cost was &euro;10.9 million and in 2016, &euro;12 million.  Whether they were based at home or abroad, we would have been paying their salaries.<\/p> <p>  I thank all members for their comments.  In response to the Chairman, there is a UN resolution on the participation of women in the Defence Forces overseas.  I attended a conference in the United Kingdom in June or July last year to discuss the gender issue.  We have introduced family friendly arrangements, whereby a man or a woman can serve for three months and be replaced by another person for a further three months during a six-month rotation.  There is one joint UNIFIL battalion with the Finns in Lebanon.  That is the only one in which we participate or plan to do so.  <\/p> <p>  I receive risk assessments, as appropriate, when I ask for them, but there are continuous risk assessments in the Defence Forces, carried out in conjunction with the United Nations.  When we send personnel overseas, what is most important for me is that they receive specific training and equipment and that I be happy with the risk assessment and information I received from the Defence Forces.  When I visit Lebanon or the Golan Heights and meet the mayors and mukhtars of the local communities, they very much appreciate Ireland's participation for many years, specifically in Lebanon where Irish personnel lost their lives.  When we send personnel abroad, we have to think, first, of their families and the people they are leaving behind and their commitment to hold the fort at home.  Many of those who go away on a tour of duty have children.  Six months is a long time to be away from their families, even allowing for annual leave.  This is very much appreciated and I know that it is appreciated by all members of the committee.  Irish personnel are recognised for their peacekeeping duties and skills wherever they participate.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett suggested we have a debate or make statements on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  I would be delighted to do so and will write to the Chief Whip to ask that she make time available for statements.  If other members speak to their Whips, we might have an hour or two because it is very important that we promote the Defence Forces.  People ask me about the Army and it is only when I explain the great work it does abroad and they see it on television that they really appreciate it.
