The correspondence is marked \"private and confidential: subject to legal professional privilege\".  The clerk requested clarification on what the Central Bank means by that but I am now informed that our legal advisers have said we can note and publish that and send it back to the people concerned.

Nos. 333C(i) and (ii) are from Mr. Aidan Sweeney of IBEC providing a policy brief to the committee in relation to local authorities.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.  Members can use it as they wish.<\/p> <p>  No. 34C is a letter dated 4 March 2017 from an individual raising a number of environmental issues and the lack of joined-up thinking across State and semi-State organisations.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 335C is a letter dated 8 March from an individual inquiring about the status of an OPW examination of cases in relation to land transactions being carried out in 2015 where there was potential for corruption.  The secretariat has contacted the OPW for an update on the case or the results of the examination.  When we get the information, we can forward it to the individual.  Is it agreed that we note the correspondence and hold it over until we get a reply?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 337C is a letter dated 10 March from the National Transport Authority providing a note on the licensing of bus services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 338C and 340C are from an individual alleging a series of issues in relation to the Garda, the HSE and her workplace.  A number of people are specifically mentioned.  This is a sensitive case and relates to a number of loosely related matters.  The clerk has spoken to the person by phone also.  While we would like to be helpful, it is not within the scope of the committee to investigate the specific matters.  It also appears the individual may be not be clear in terms of how the issues can be best examined.  I propose we write to the person explaining the committee's role but indicating that she should contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission if she believes an issue arises in connection with the Garda; that she should contact the Medical Council in relation to alleged medical mistreatment, to which she referred in the letter; and she should contact the Workplace Relations Commission to seek advice on work related matters.  Beyond that, I do not think we can do a whole lot.  Her letter gives rise to wide-ranging issues.  We want to be helpful to the person but it is not a matter for us.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 339C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 14 March from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board responding to a request for a detailed note on the overall estimated cost of the new children's hospital development project.  In the letter, it is mentioned that a memorandum is to go to Government in the coming weeks and that costs will be set out and discussed by the Government.  Following that the committee will receive a more complete response.  Does any member wish to comment?

Members will recall we have had a number of items of correspondence on this matter.  The Minister's office has reviewed the matter and liaised with the HSE which believes it is complying with its commercial obligations.  From the committee's point of view, I believe we cannot take it further, as it is essentially a contractual dispute between the association and the HSE.  I propose we write to the North Meath Community Development Association and advise it accordingly that the committee cannot take the matter any further at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 345C is dated 16 March 2017 and is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in relation to the Water Framework Directive.  I propose we forward a copy to the correspondent who raised the matter, who happens to be the same individual who wrote to us in relation to the environmental issues discussed earlier.  We are still waiting a detailed response from the Department following our recent meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 348C (i) and (ii) is from Nursing Homes Ireland dated 16 March 2017 providing a submission to the committee on the HSE response to the committee in relation to residential care costs.  I think members may want to consider this further.  I propose that we have another engagement with the HSE sometime after Easter and that could be one of the issues we will discuss.  Since the committee first met in the second half of 2016 we have had the HSE in to speak on several occasions, including on Console.  Recently, the HSE was in to speak specifically on nursing homes and patients' private fund accounts.  Today, Mr. O'Brien is in to deal with the record of the previous meeting, but the committee in the normal course of events would schedule a full meeting to discuss HSE matters.  We will schedule a meeting and that issue can be included.  We have not had the HSE in to discuss its accounts for the year.  We will set a date for that and deal with the issue then.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>No. 349C dated 21 March is correspondence from an individual raising matters in connection with Bord na gCon accounts.  The individual suggests we get the figures for the first quarter of 2017 when we engage with Bord na gCon.

Today we have the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE in the afternoon.  The HSE will be here to deal with the record of previous HSE meetings.  <\/p> <p>  We are scheduling the Higher Education Authority for a meeting next Wednesday and are suggesting 5 o'clock.  We had intended dealing with it this afternoon but because of the HSE issue, we have moved the HEA to next week.  We want to get it in before we meet with the third level institutions.  On Thursday, 30 March we have UCC, Dundalk Institute of Technology and University of Limerick.  On 6 April, we have Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and National University of Ireland Galway.  The meeting with the Higher Education Authority is scheduled for 5 p.m. next Wednesday but it may have to be moved because the business committee is considering the timing of the D&aacute;il debate on our report on Project Eagle.  There is a question of it being taken in Government time which will be next Wednesday evening.  If that is the case, we will have to change the time and make the meeting with the HEA a little bit earlier.  We will know when the business committee finishes its work today.  We will come back to the committee if there is a change of time in that.  We thought it might be on Wednesday morning at 11.50 a.m. but it might be taken in Government time on Wednesday so our meeting might have to move a little bit.  That is 6 April.  <\/p> <p>  On 13 April, we will have the Department of Education and Skills in to deal with the special report on the residential institutions redress fund and the follow through on that.  Representatives from Caranua will join us for that meeting.  There has been a lot of public discussion about Caranua.  The following week is the Easter break and we are not sitting that week.  The D&aacute;il is not sitting the week after that either so there is a two-week D&aacute;il break.  Do members want to sit that second week and have a meeting to deal with some of our issues or are we happy to leave the two-week break?  I do not detect any gushing enthusiasm for an earlier meeting.  We will move on.<\/p> <p>  Provisionally we have the Revenue Commissioners set for 4 May.  On 11 May we have the Department of Finance.  There is an issue we have to deal with.

In addition, the Department administers the National Training Fund, NTF, which recorded expenditure of &euro;334 million in 2015.  The Vote and the fund are managed together within an overall spending limit which is set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  On the income side, receipts into the Vote as appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;549 million.  Over 93% of this, or &euro;513 million, comprised employee pension contributions and pension related deductions from teachers&rsquo; and other education sector employees&rsquo; salaries.  Receipts into the fund, totalling &euro;370 million in 2015, come mainly from a statutory training levy collected on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Revenue Commissioners as part of employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions.  <\/p> <p>  The gross Vote expenditure was spread across four expenditure programmes, as shown in the graph now on screen.  Note 3 in the appropriation account gives a more detailed breakdown of each of the programmes.  As the graph shows, the preponderance of expenditure was in the first, second and early years education programme, at 71%, followed by the higher education programme, at 17%.  Over 87% of the &euro;6.2 billion voted expenditure on first, second and early years education relates to the pay and pension costs of teachers, special needs assistants and non-teaching school staff.  Other substantial areas of spending included in the programme are capitation and other grants to schools and the cost of school transport.  This programme also includes spending on residential institutions redress, about which I have reported separately, and which the committee has indicated it will examine in the coming weeks. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure under the higher education programme was &euro;1.5 billion.  This consists mainly of grants to third level education institutions of &euro;922 million, channelled through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and student support grants totalling &euro;414 million.  The original Vote Estimate provided for student support grants of &euro;332 million, down from &euro;372 million in 2014, representing a reduction of around 11%.  The outturn for the year was 25% higher than originally provided and was funded substantially by a Supplementary Estimate provision of &euro;78 million.  The committee may wish to note that student support grants are administered nationally on behalf of the Department by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, under the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, system. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure on capital services in 2015 was &euro;655 million, made up of &euro;577 million in building and equipment grants across the education sectors, &euro;66 million in payments under public private partnership, PPP, agreements and the balance of &euro;11 million in administration costs.  Forward capital commitments under contracted PPP arrangements at the end of 2015 amounted to an estimated &euro;478 million, as indicated in the notes to the account.  When recurrent commitments under the PPPs are included, the total legally enforceable commitments amounted to an estimated &euro;1.34 billion.<\/p> <p>  Almost all of the &euro;330 million spent on skills development under the Vote represents funding provided to SOLAS, the further education and training body.  SOLAS income in 2015 was &euro;591 million which included the grant funding received from the Vote and funding of &euro;279 million from the NTF. <\/p> <p>  The overall grant funding provided to the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, is not evident from the appropriation account.  The boards were established in 2013 following the dissolution of vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took on certain training functions of the former F&Aacute;S.  Excluding the student support grant funding provided to CDETB that I referred to earlier, over 90% of the combined income of the boards, which is estimated at around &euro;1.5 billion in 2015, originates from the Vote or the NTF.  The first, second and early years education programme covers ETB teacher and other salaries and school capitation grants.  SOLAS provides funding to the ETBs for further education and training and finally, building and equipment grants paid to ETBs are financed from the capital programme. <\/p> <p>  About a month ago, I published a special report on financial reporting in the public sector.  In that report, I highlighted a general problem around the late finalisation of the ETB financial statements for 2013-14.  These were the first financial statements for the new boards.  A number of the new boards had difficulties putting the required reporting arrangements in place across the revised areas of operation.  At present, statements for the 2013-14 period of account for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB remain uncertified.  The 2015 financial statements for 11 of the ETBs have been completed and presented to the Oireachtas and the audits of three ETBs for 2015 are at various stages of progress.<\/p><p>Two education and training boards, ETBs, have not yet produced draft financial statements for 2015, namely, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and Limerick and Clare ETB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.<\/p> <p>  I propose the committee writes to the chairpersons of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and Limerick and Clare ETB, requesting an immediate explanation as to why their accounts for 2015 have not been prepared to date.<\/p> <p>  I call Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#E00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the 2015 appropriation accounts of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have provided the committee with briefing material and, accordingly, in the interests of making best use of the committee's time, I will keep my opening statement short.<\/p> <p>  The Department's net voted expenditure in 2015 was nearly &euro;8.2 billion.  Of this, &euro;621 million was capital expenditure.  In addition, the Department's expenditure ceiling included the non-voted national training fund, which had an allocation of &euro;362 million in 2015, providing for upskilling and re-skilling for both of those seeking employment and those in employment.  The Department received &euro;549 million in appropriations-in-aid.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 80% of the Department's overall budget is accounted for by pay and superannuation.  In 2015, this provided for over 98,000 public service employees and over 44,000 public service pensioners.<\/p> <p>  The Department's expenditure is subdivided into four expenditure programmes.  Programme A provides for first, second and early years' education.  The overall expenditure in 2015 was &euro;6.2 billion, which among other things, covered pay and superannuation for teachers and special needs assistants, grants to schools, including capitation, costs associated with teacher education and provision of school transport.<\/p> <p>  Programme B covers skills development, including upskilling and re-skilling that meets the needs of individuals and the labour market.  The overall expenditure from the Vote in 2016 was &euro;329 million, which among other things, covered grants to Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, SOLAS, in respect of further education and training.  It also provides funding for support of the European Social Fund and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's activities in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Programme C supports learning, research and innovation opportunities in the higher education sector.  Expenditure in 2015 was over &euro;1.5 billion, covering grants to higher education institutions, superannuation costs, research, student support and related costs, international activities and grants to the Higher Education Authority.<\/p> <p>  Programme D covers capital services and supports the planning and provision of appropriate infrastructure for learning environments through the Department's building programme.  The total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;655 million which covered the costs of building, equipping and furnishing of schools, higher education capital costs and costs associated with public private partnerships.<\/p> <p>  The Department was voted a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;175 million towards the end of 2015.  This made provision for an increased allocation of special needs assistants, increased superannuation payments in the schools and institute of technology sectors, an additional allocation for higher education student support and provision for summer works scheme.  The Supplementary Estimate also took account of a projected shortfall in the level of receipts to be brought to account in 2015.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious the issue of timeliness in the submission of accounts and financial statements is a matter of concern to the committee.  It was flagged as an issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent special report.  The report acknowledges the background to these delays, including the pressures which resulted from the public service moratorium, the significant organisational change which has taken place in the ETB sector and the particular complexities which pertain in the university sector given the significant amounts of non-Exchequer funding.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue which the Department is taking seriously.  We have been engaging with sectors on measures to improve reporting capabilities, including filling critical vacancies.  In our engagement with our bodies, we have strengthened our emphasis on the importance of timely submission of accounts.  We have also stressed the importance of communication and engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to ensure a collaborative approach to addressing issues which arise.<\/p> <p>  More widely, we see our response to this issue as part of an overall effort which the Department is undertaking to further develop and implement robust and consistent governance arrangements across the education sector.  Our aim is to ensure utilisation of public funds is achieved within a framework of high standards of performance, accountability, compliance and oversight.  A management board committee on sectoral governance and accountability, which I chair, was established in 2015.  This committee provides overall guidance on the enhancement of governance arrangements across the education sector.  This has included enhancement of audit oversight in certain sectors, as well as ensuring enhanced compliance-reporting structures are in place specifically to address the timely clearance and certification of financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The committee also reviews work on governance enhancement across the education sector, for example, rolling compliance reviews being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, roll out of the financial services support unit at primary school level and work to review the code of practice for the governance of education and training boards.  The management board committee is complemented by a principal officer sectoral governance network, which includes principal officers with responsibility for public service bodies.  An internal audit education sector forum has also been established.<\/p> <p>  A specific sectoral governance unit has been set up in the Department.  This unit provides support to the management board committee and principal officer network, as well as undertaking work to support the enhancement and standardisation of governance and accountability oversight across the Department.  This has included rolling out of the first phase of a programme of governance compliance reviews involving the Department's non-commercial bodies.<\/p> <p>  This is an area we will continue to focus on, having regard to good practice and developments in governance generally, including issues which have been identified by the Committee of Public Accounts as part of its work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

This question really concerns teachers, primarily, who are also on our payroll.  We operate the biggest payroll in the State.  We have, I think, just over 100,000 payees.  The supplementary pension is a top-up pension paid by occupational pension providers in the period between retirement and age 66 to public servants who paid class A PRSI in order to ensure that they are not disadvantaged.  It is a rule of the pension scheme that a supplementary pension should cease or be abated as appropriate when a pensioner applies for and comes into receipt of the State pension.  This fact would have been documented to pensioners.  The advent of new pension legislation in late 2012 facilitated the sharing of information between this Department and the Department of Social Protection.  In late 2012 and early 2013, the Department conducted an analysis of those pensioners over 65 who were in receipt of a supplementary pension.  On completion of this analysis and a follow-up exercise, about 320 teacher pensioners were identified as being in receipt of a supplementary pension to which they were no longer entitled as they were also in receipt of a State pension from the Department of Social Protection.  Payment of the supplementary pension ceased as soon as possible and the overpayment calculated.  The gross overpayments amounted to &euro;2.7 million, however, net of statutory deductions they were likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.

Under that model there is a trust involved jointly between a religious order and the education and training board, formerly the VECs, or the community schools.  The predominant model was the denominational school model.  We have effectively stopped that model for new schools.<\/p> <p>  The model we have now is that the Department sources the land and enters into a lease agreement with the patron.  It may be land for a brand new school being established, in which case there is a process to decide on patronage, but equally it may be a school moving or expanding and needing a new piece of land.  We would normally buy that land now.  In exceptional circumstances the denominational body may have land they wish to provide but that is becoming very rare now, so we normally buy the land.  We, therefore, have ownership of the land for the future.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of releasing the interest in land that was previously held, that would generally occur where a school building is not in use any more and may no longer be needed.  Generally, the Catholic Church or another church body would have ownership of it.  The Department would have an interest, a lien, because of its investment and would get some repayment from the owner to release that interest.  It would typically be fairly small.  Typically, these cases occur with buildings that are no longer in educational use.  Sometimes we waive that.  Often we waive it if the building is going to continue in community use.  We would generally only seek payment if the building is being sold on for further use or if it is entering into commercial use.

I have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, although not in this particular session, on a number of occasions regarding Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  We had a hearing on it two and half or three years ago.  SUSI is operating very well.  It is processing applications in line with its objectives.  Obviously, it is very difficult to get that flow of information completely right, but it has been bringing back the time from which people can apply to as early as possible.  It has been processing those quickly.  Partly as a result of that, grants and fee payments are being processed more speedily.<\/p> <p>  The manner of releasing tranches of money to individuals was reviewed and revised and was brought forward a bit because of the pressures on individuals in the first term.  It pays slightly higher amounts to individuals in the first term than it did previously.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, having regard to the financial position of the higher education institutions, the timing of payments to those has been revised a couple of times.  We have tried different ways of doing that.  We are trying to maximise the appropriate way to transfer money from SUSI to the institutions.  We are particularly conscious of a few issues.<\/p><p>One is that not every recipient of student support completes his or her course.  Particularly in first year, there is an issue about completing the first term.  We have to be careful about that.  Also, people want to have their grant protected so that if they attend only half of the first term, they have protection in place if they seek to commence another course.  Issues such as that arise.  It is a matter of making sure we have appropriate arrangements in place.  There is a complex set of different arrangements that we put in place to bring that forward.  Particularly in the context of the Supplementary Estimate, we brought forward the payments to institutions given that higher education is in a very tight funding position.  We did not want to be under-funding from SUSI into the higher education sector.  We wanted to make sure that we were funding appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#G02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Naturally.

The first issue relates to the amalgamation of the VECs into the ETBs and the big change of which that was part.  They were effectively new State bodies which were amalgamated State bodies from the ETB.  That was the first issue.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue, concerning amalgamation, where we were amalgamating two and sometimes three former VECs into ETBs - both of the ones that were talked about here were actually three VECs coming together - they would have had different financial systems and so on.  We had reduced staffing as a result of the amalgamation so we have been working through, with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form and manner of the accounts.  We have been working through the updating of the systems and we are putting in place a shared financial services system, which is under way in planning, as well as a shared payroll system.  We are working that through.<\/p> <p>  For the ETBs that were particularly challenged, we have prioritised additional resources.  They are seeking to address this.  The particular one that has not completed the initial set of accounts has had to do a manual check through all its work.  It is working through that manual check at the moment.  It hopes to complete that in the next short while - we are talking weeks here - and it will move immediately to a manual check of the payments for the following year.  It is an 18-month account followed by a 12-month account.  The ETB is very conscious of the need to do that.  To be fair to that ETB, the VECs that make up that ETB actually had been fairly efficient in returning their accounts previously so it is not that they comprised an inefficient organisation coming in; it is just the mixing of the new organisation having regard to the staffing.  Particularly in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, there was a long-term sick-leave issue in the leadership of the accounts.  There were a number of different factors that gave rise to the issue.  That is not to say that the ETB is complacent about it.

It is not bonus money available to us to be spent on education and training.  It would be great if it was, but it is not.

One is a &euro;200 million bundle of higher education PPPs and the second is Grangegorman, where we are hoping to advance arrangements very speedily.  We have undertaken an exercise with higher education institutions relating to future funding of capital developments.  We put a call out to them regarding areas for which they would wish to have funding.  We will examine those in the context, hopefully, of the Government deciding to give us additional funding under the capital review or, possibly, in the context of the &euro;200 million programme of PPPs to which we are committed.  The European Investment Bank is one of the primary funders under the PPPs, so that is a good way to access funding.  The European Investment Bank is also a funder of developments in the university sector, which is very useful.  It enables them to borrow in addition to the commitments they get from the State.  It also can replace other areas of Exchequer borrowing in our capital plan.  We always work closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that some of the borrowing for the schools or other developments may be funded by the EIB.  That would be organised centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We would not be directly involved.<\/p> <p>  A further area of innovation, and it is one we are very conscious of, is the balance in funding where it occurs, particularly in higher education and in the university sector, but not uniquely.  There can be elements of philanthropical investment, so the full cost need not have to be borne by the State.  A building might be 50% funded through private sources, so the State investment is not the full investment.  Obviously there can be good returns for the State in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of different ways in which we are seeking to be innovative.  I would not rule out any other options in the future because it is an area we seek to keep under review.

It is trialling some arrangements with some of the ETBs about what capacity there is to move in that direction.  There have been movements in terms of funding mechanisms to try different streams and aspects of funding to move things around.  Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of public sector employees so there are limits.  However, there is some capacity that is used to tender for provision of services.  Combined with that, a lot of work on outcomes is under way.  A training programme participants annual survey by SOLAS is under way to look at completion rates and so on.  We are also looking at arrangements to put databases in further education and training in place so there can be follow on regarding the effectiveness of provision in order that we can see not just from returns from people but also from looking at Revenue records on an impersonal basis and social welfare to see where people are six months or a year on from having a completed a course.

We have published a discussion paper about investment in further and higher education.  I am not aware of responses having been received.  To be fair, there is a range of businesses.  They range from SMEs up to the big multinationals.  There is a recognition of the need to have sufficient funding in place for further and higher education and training.  I did not talk about the apprenticeship developments but those are under way as well.  It is a challenge for them.  To be fair to them, in our dialogue with them, some of them have been supportive of considering increases in the national training fund, NTF.  Listening to what they have been saying, they would like to see commitments from the State at the same time.  This is the first year in a number of years where we have been able to enhance the budget in higher education with the additional &euro;35 million we received in the budget.

We find it very valuable to be able to plan in a joined-up way for the education and training sector.  It is effectively a plan for us and our national agencies combined and we are seeking to do it in partnership with them.  There is a wide range of different aspects across all areas.  One of things we are trying not to get lost in, although it is important, is the issue of resources being the only thing.  Yes, there is a dependency on resources to expand provision but everything does not depend on additional resources.  We must look at how we can work resources; be more efficient, which is the business of this committee; decide to stop funding areas; change funding; and seek to increase funding having regard to the resources available to us.  It gives us a coherent way to seek to do that.  There are different challenges in each of the different sectors.  There are challenges for the Department and the national agencies in terms of prioritising.  We would operate a number of overlapping strategies within the action plan.  An example of that would be the national skills strategy, whose actions are embedded in it, or the literacy and numeracy strategy.

There are two other ways in which we are seeking to enhance multidenominational provision in addition to new schools.  One is what was called divesting arising from the report of the forum on pluralism.  A number of areas were identified and we seeking to negotiate in those areas for existing schools or school buildings that might not be in use or other public sector buildings to be transferred to our ownership or leased to us to enable us to open schools.  We have succeeded in about eight or ten schools in that regard.  I have the precise figure but I do not have it to hand.  We have initiated a further process where we are seeking to engage with the ETBs, communities and existing school patrons to see if there are possibilities for patronage change.  We are trying in a number of different ways.  It is a challenge because we do not own the school buildings.  The school buildings are owned by the local communities.  Regarding support for change in the community, if one takes a community that might have five schools, each of which might contain 20% who would like a change, it means that there is no majority for change in any of the five schools.  However, in the area as a whole, possibly a total of a single school population would wish to change.<\/p><p>This is down to negotiation in communities and so on and we see a potential valuable role for the education and training boards in having an involvement so there is not a perception of a top down approach from the Department in communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#N01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I note from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the Department made a settlement of &euro;1,359,358 with the Revenue Commissioners in March 2015 relating to the period, 2010-13.

Groups such as the National Parents' Council have been very supportive of this.  At the moment, the special education section combined with the inspectorate and NEPS and the NCSE are doing a series of information sessions with schools to explain how this is changing.  There was one in Croke Park this week for primary and post-primary schools, and there will be one next week in Limerick.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on the earlier point about NEPS role, it will continue to have a role on resource teaching even under the new model but the role will be different.  It will be more supportive of schools.  Instead of NEPS spending time doing assessments, that time can be used more profitably assisting schools, working with pupils and teachers to support their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy Connolly but I will return to her.<\/p> <p>  What about parents who were unable to get it through the one or two that were provided to the schools?

We are spending &euro;1.7 billion in 2017 on special education.  In 2007, we were spending about &euro;800 million.  There has been a huge commitment from the State under various Governments to enhancing expenditure to meet the needs of those with special educational needs.  We are always seeking to try to make it as effective as possible with our SNA review, our new model and the various arrangements we have to support school transport.  Balancing that with what we were talking about earlier in higher education, there has been a huge amount of investment in special education to try to meet the particular needs and try to be as helpful as we can to this group.  We have to acknowledge that in all of the discussions we have.  The issue for us is also about the effectiveness of the expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the specific issue about ASD units, we obviously work with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on ASD units.  It tries to advise and plan on where there is a need for ASD units to go.  Typically in new builds and new post-primary schools, we put in ASD units as we are doing them.  Typically, the NCSE and ourselves negotiate with primary schools and post-primary schools about the demand.  There is always a difficulty, especially at different times of the year when there is an uncertainty about where demands arise.  I am aware of different cases or groups of cases in which there are challenges.  This has been debated at the Oireachtas committee on education and in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  I and Mr. Tattan have discussed it with the Minister for consideration.  We are looking through the issues around ASD units and the demand at second level to try to get an evidential basis for that demand and to see if it is being met.  We believe the system is responding, but we need to double-check that having regard, as Deputy Connolly said, to information that is coming.  We have to be responsive.

We have put a huge amount of effort, in partnership with the NCSE, into ensuring that in terms of teacher allocations, rather than it being a decision made externally to a school, we give sufficient resources to the school to manage it and be responsive in a local context.

I am not sure what the outcome of that will be, but we have hugely increased our investment in SNAs.<\/p> <p>  We want to encourage children to stay in mainstream second level education.  We want to work with schools to put ASD units in place to enable that to be the case.  With the NCSE, we are working with all schools to ensure that can be the case.

That is one of the reasons we have a specific proposal in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to give the power to the NCSE to place a child with special educational needs in a school.

In the past few years, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs developed an early childhood care and education programme which also falls under the remit of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  People in the early childhood sector find they fall between three stools.  In the Action Plan for Education 2017, one of the key themes is the increased quality of learning in early years.  The Department states:<\/p><blockquote>We will continue to actively support the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to improve the quality of early year&rsquo;s provision.

I know Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; would know that those working in this sector are pioneering education there.  I would hope that the Department of Education and Skills would be an advocate for them and that it would speak about this sector coming within its remit.<\/p><p>In regard to the commitment in its action plan to deliver quality learning, the majority of people the Department is assisting are working for the minimum wage and my question is whether this is acceptable.

We cannot expand funding for places, where there enough places available already, for the purposes of choice.  We did that to a certain extent up until 2007 or 2008.  Given the pressures on the budget now, however, allowing a school to go from two streams down to one stream and building a new school next door is not an efficient use of Government money.  In simple terms, it is inefficient to fund for three streams but only have two in use.  However, it is never as simple as that and that is why we want to allow schools to reconfigure in the primary space.  If there is a demand for more Irish-medium or multi-denominational spaces, the best option is for a school to switch.  That way, we do not have to put in the investment again.  That is why we have this exercise with the ETBs.  In the particular case of north Kildare regarding the gaelchol&aacute;iste and an Aonad in the ETB school, that is under active consideration at the moment.  The case is very well made and we have committed to actively examining it.  I do not see that particular case as one involving huge costs.  Hopefully we will be able to sort that one out, given that the demand is shown and there is an expanding number of students in the area.

That is as much as I know.<\/p><p>This afternoon we are dealing with matters relating to the appearance of witnesses from the Health Service Executive, HSE, before the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  At our meeting two weeks ago, certain matters were raised relating to Grace, the case of abuse that was the focus of RTE's &quot;This Week&quot; programme of 5 March 2017.  These matters apparently conflict with evidence given by the HSE to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  The committee has asked the HSE to correct the record, if necessary, and to explain the reason for the apparent conflict arising from the programme.  I am glad a delegation from the HSE has joined us today to do so and Mr. O'Brien is welcome.<\/p><p>This is not an opportunity to reopen consideration of all matters discussed on that occasion.  I have received a copy of the statement proposed to be made and I am satisfied that it confines itself to the purpose of the meeting.  Having regard to the fact that a commission of investigation has been established by the Oireachtas, the Grace case must be regarded as <i>sub judice<\/i>and is effectively under a judge to examine at this point.  I repeat that we are not here to reopen the Grace case and the Oireachtas has established a commission of investigation to deal with it.  We are not a parallel commission of inquiry or examination of the Grace case.  I must be very clear about that.  It would not be in order to go beyond the very limited purposes of this session and put forward questions to witnesses, except to the extent to which they relate directly to the statement made and they are clearly necessary in order to clarify the context of today's statement.  In these circumstances it is my responsibility, as Chairman, to seek to ensure that questions asked are consistent with the purpose of the meeting, genuinely seeking clarification, and do not in any material way otherwise encroach or impinge upon the functions of a commission of investigation.  Accordingly, I expect members who may wish to ask questions to clearly identify the part of the statement from last year to which the question relates and the reason they believe clarification is necessary.<\/p><p>Before going any further I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, who is here along with Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell.  I thank them for coming and I acknowledge that a commission of investigation has been established.  They may have been within their rights not to come in view of the fact that the Oireachtas has established that commission of investigation.  We appreciate them coming before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with matters raised at a previous meeting.<\/p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>Before asking Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement, I should indicate that the sequence for questions will be Deputy Cullinane, Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Madigan and then Deputy Connolly.  I will confine each Deputy to a ten-minute slot because it is not fair on other members if people go on at length.  If questions are not covered in the slot, there will be another opportunity to come back in.  I will be rigid on that time limit today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#RR00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I am joined by Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell, who are not witnesses but who will assist me with the documentation.  I have reviewed the transcript of my evidence to the committee on 2 February 2016 as requested.  I note the clarification from the Chairman to the effect that the focus of my contribution should be only on those areas where the record needs to be corrected.<\/p> <p>  In the interest of garnering as much information as possible to respond to the committee, I initiated an examination of the two matters referred to by the Chairman in his letter to me.  Whereas this examination had not fully concluded when my initial letter was sent to the committee on 16 March, in the interests of providing as much information and clarity to the committee as possible, the examination continued after my initial letter was sent.  Consequently, the committee will note that I sent a second letter to it on foot of further and better information.  I have sought to expand on those aspects of my contribution where issues were raised by the members of the committee as per the Chairman&rsquo;s letter.  I have limited my reply to the specific issues identified by the Chairman and I will focus my contribution on those matters.  Arising from my review of the transcripts, there is one other matter, while not raised specifically by the committee, that I wish to include in this response by way of providing additional clarity.  I wish to stress that the evidence provided by me to the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter has been given with the utmost of good faith and with the sole purpose of assisting the committee and its members in as much as I possibly could at those individual sittings.<\/p> <p>  As I highlighted to the committee on a number of occasions, the evidence I provided at three sittings in 2015 and 2016 on this matter was somewhat restricted for reasons outside my control.  Given that neither of the two reports - the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports - had been published at that time, I was attempting to answer questions and provide information to members while constrained by the fact that I could not speak openly on matters.  This, as Deputies are aware, was to avoid interfering with a live Garda investigation.  Consequently, words or phrases chosen by me during questioning by members to explain matters would not necessarily have been ones that I would have chosen had I had complete freedom to discuss the information contained within both reports.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the question of liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2012 on the matters concerned.  The HSE has been aware since 2011 of live Garda investigations into a number of cases relating to this former foster home.  Since that time, HSE staff at local level have been involved in ongoing engagement and liaison with senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been leading the investigation into this matter.  Liaison and engagement between the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved many forms, including meetings, the exchange of relevant correspondence and the provision of additional information and files to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as live investigations proceeded throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014.  By way of example, the Conal Devine report was provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2012 to further assist it with its ongoing investigations at that time.  In April 2013, HSE staff at local level were advised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they would retain files pertaining to Grace as there were, at that point, three further investigations being conducted as a direct result of the investigation into the case.<\/p><p>Later in August 2013, further files were sought formally in relation to these investigations.<\/p><p> Furthermore, throughout the years 2014 and 2015 there was considerable contact between AGS and the HSE------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#RR00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I take it AGS is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

That is what I mean.<br\/><br\/>That contact, in 2014 and 2015, through Resilience Ireland, was part of the &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry of the other 46 service users.  Part of this contact involved the development of an agreed protocol whereby no contact would be initiated with the families of the 46 service users until An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, AGS, had completed its interviews.  The HSE continued to receive updates on the live investigation from many channels, including AGS, local health staff and also through other official channels.<br\/><br\/>For the information of the committee, a schedule of engagements between local management and AGS, from 2011-2015, was enclosed with the letter as Appendix 1.<br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware that the Dignam report, paragraph 3.3.5, confirms ongoing liaison and engagement between the HSE and AGS where he states the following:<\/p><blockquote>There was clearly ongoing contact between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which members of the Inquiry Team were centrally involved.  For example, on the 27th March, 2014, Ms. O wrote to the relevant Superintendent in relation to a meeting arranged for the 1st April 2014, the purpose of which was stated to be &quot;to ensure that all relevant information available to the HSE is provided to Garda&iacute; in the context of the known investigation which you are currently undertaking in the context of a foster ... family in [named location].<\/blockquote> <p>At the commencement of the committee meeting on 9 March 2017, the Chairman referred to media reports indicating that communication between the HSE and AGS commenced in 2015.<br\/><br\/>As to the full extent of HSE-AGS liaison and engagement on this important matter, certain media reports over the past number of weeks have been incomplete.  The genesis of the media reports was information provided in response to a freedom of information, FOI, request.  The request was quite specific and sought, &quot;all correspondence between the HSE Social Care Division and the HSE Director General's Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the subject of the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland Reports&quot; from December 2014.<br\/><br\/>As set out in the schedule mentioned above, the liaison and engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between 2011 and 2015 was through the HSE's local office.  This correspondence did not come within the scope of the FOI request and therefore would not have been included in the material released.  Had the requester included the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and included HSE services at local level the information sought and provided would have allowed a more complete picture of the situation, and could have avoided some incorrect media headlines.<br\/><br\/>While much of the media coverage dealt with HSE contact with AGS surrounding the publication of the Devine report, for completeness it is important to state that the HSE, while aware of ongoing live investigations surrounding the former foster home, did not seek formal clearance to publish the two reports until February 2015.<br\/><br\/>The convention and standard practice throughout the HSE and the former health boards was that such reports would not be published while live Garda investigations were under way, in order to avoid interfering with AGS processes.  In the case of the Devine report, given that the HSE was made aware that live AGS investigations were under way, convention and standard practice was followed by the local HSE.<br\/><br\/>For specific reasons, in early 2015 the HSE chose to depart from this convention and standard practice in relation to these matters and, notwithstanding knowledge of a live AGS investigation, decided to proceed towards publication of both Devine and Resilience.  This decision was progressed for the following reasons: the HSE's awareness that AGS investigations were at that stage well advanced; the Resilience Ireland &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry report was close to completion and the considerable benefits of publishing both reports together; and an awareness of a significant public interest in the publication of both reports.<br\/><br\/>In this context, following considerable deliberation on the matter, on 24 February 2015 the HSE requested in writing that our legal advisers commence, on our behalf, the process of publication of both reports through formal engagement with AGS and other relevant bodies including the Information Commissioner and Wards of Courts Office.  In this regard, our legal advisers wrote to AGS on 6 March 2015 informing them of our intention to publish both reports in April 2015.  AGS responded to the HSE, through our legal advisers, on 14 April 2015 requesting us not to publish the reports.<br\/><br\/>Conor Dignam SC in his report, at paragraph 2.5.4.7, notes that in many cases reports should not be published if AGS are of a view that publication is likely to interfere with investigations.  He says, &quot;It is correct and proper, therefore, that the HSE and, indeed, the Minister, should afford considerable deference to the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when deciding whether the Reports should be published or not and it will properly be the case in very many, if not almost every case, that if the Garda&iacute; are of the view that a matter should not be published because it will interfere with a criminal investigation then it should not and will not be published by a public body.&quot;<br\/><br\/>At paragraph 2.5.4.0, Dignam notes that AGS would likely have taken a position against publication of these reports even if the HSE had sought approval at an earlier stage.  He states:<\/p><blockquote>However, it is only fair to point out that matters were not straightforward.  It is likely that even if the HSE had asked the Garda&iacute; at an earlier stage the Garda&iacute; would have expressed a concern at the impact on ongoing investigations.<\/blockquote> <p>Turning to the second area, the reference to the persons involved in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, in responding to questions I was doing my utmost to provide as much clarity as possible on this matter.  However, I was somewhat constrained as to the extent of information that I could provide on the basis that AGS had not - at that time - provided approval for the reports to be published and the risk of interfering with a live Garda investigation.  I was also conscious of not prejudicing individuals who may be subject to a HR process.<br\/><br\/>On many occasions during the course of hearings before the PAC, I highlighted the fact that I was constrained as to how much information I was in a position to provide at that time.<br\/><br\/>In responding to the specific question, I took into consideration two relevant sections of the Devine report, sections 4 and 5, in particular, section 4.4.15.  Consideration of both sections is important in order to have a full understanding of the significance of each person's role in the key decision events in 1996, in particular, the case conference that occurred in October 1996.<br\/><br\/>Section 4.4.15 on page 32 of the Devine report sets out the detail of the October 1996 case conference; those involved in same - numbering five people, the decisions made and the actions to be undertaken on foot of those decisions by the responsible professionals - numbering three people.<br\/><br\/>The information, as set out in section 4, confirms the decision that Grace was (a) to remain in the foster placement, (b) to continue in her day service, (c) responsibility for her care was to transfer to the adult disability services, and (d) a new key worker - from adult disability services - was to be assigned to her case as she would no longer be in the care of the foster care team.  The case conference also decided that any change in her circumstances would be reviewed by the adult disability services and that, significantly, they would progress making Grace a ward of court, the implementation of which was to be followed up by the new key worker.<br\/><br\/>What is important to note here is that of the five-person case conference, three people had an important dual function: (a) participation in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, and (b) carrying out a series of eight actions that needed to be taken in order to make the environment safe for Grace to remain there.<br\/><br\/>The following sections in the Devine report, that is, page 32 onwards, identify how these key actions were not followed up by some of the three individuals who were tasked with making Grace's environment safe.  In effect, this meant that the young woman was not made a ward of court, nor was her care appropriately followed up.  She remained with the family until she was removed in 2009.<\/p><p>When I mentioned &quot;a three-person panel, for want of a better word&quot; - that is on page 9, paragraph 8 of the transcript of 2 February 2016 in response to a member's question - it was the three individuals who had this important dual function: decision role and implementation of actions.  For the sake of clarity, this refers to H7, H3 and H12.<br\/><br\/>I went on to say: &quot;This was made by a three-person panel, for want of a better word, and those three persons are no longer in the public service to be clear about that.&quot;  It is the same section of the transcript.<br\/><br\/>The three persons to whom I referred - H7, H3 and H12 as per the Devine report - had all retired from the HSE on the date that I made this statement.  The HSE payroll system indicates that all three are in receipt of full HSE pensions.  This indicates that all three are retired from the public service.  It was on this basis that I stated, and believed, that the three persons - H7, H3 and H12 - were no longer in the public service.<br\/><br\/>On foot of the examination that I initiated, I would like to correct the record of the Committee in respect of H3 as follows: H3 retired from the HSE in 2012 and is in receipt of a full HSE pension that is recorded on HSE&rsquo;s pension-payroll system.  It was on this basis that I stated that H3 is retired from the public service also.  I have now established that H3 provides some specialist clinical services to Tusla on a part-time contract basis.  H3 provided a similar service to the former children and families service - part of the HSE until the end of 2013.  On the formal creation of Tusla in January 2014, any relationship between the HSE and H3 would have ceased.<br\/><br\/>This information came to my attention yesterday, Wednesday, 22 March, by way of the examination process that I initiated.  This examination was not straightforward as H3 possesses a number of payroll numbers, both pay and pension, across two organisations, within a financial-payroll system that is not sufficiently integrated to allow the many payroll numbers to be attributed to one person.  In light of information that I now have, I wish to correct the record of my information to the committee dated 2 February 2016 at page 9.  H3, while retired from the HSE, is currently in public service on a part-time basis in Tusla.  I wish to apologise to the committee for not being in a position to have had more complete information at the time in February 2016.<br\/><br\/>As stated by me during the course of that meeting:<\/p><blockquote>There are many people who were involved in different ways in those processes.  One of the features of this is the disagreements that occurred at different times as to what should have occurred and different people were on different sides of those disagreements.  Some of those people are still working in either the HSE or Tusla.<\/blockquote><p>That is from page 13.<br\/><br\/>I further commented at the same meeting: &quot;There are people who are referenced in those reports in many different ways who are currently employed either in the health service or in Tusla, as I said earlier&quot;.  In stating this, I was acknowledging that there are other people who were involved in aspects of decisions around Grace, both in 1996 and at other times, who currently work in the HSE or Tusla and who may face disciplinary action now that both reports have been published.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I refer to level of funding to the voluntary provider.  During the course of my opening statement last year on page 6, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with that organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding to which it was agreeable.  This independent external review by Deloitte is now nearing completion.  That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#SS00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

I do not believe the issue of the two dates is the really important one.  I believe the events of 6 March happened because of the article in <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>on 22 February.

There is no credible reason for there being such a delay in asking the Garda whether the report could be published.  This should have been a request that was ongoing, or one being made all the time.  Because it had taken this length of time, all of a sudden, the heat was on in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and it was coming from the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  In fairness to both the print and broadcast media then and now, we would not be sitting here were it not for them.  They have done us all a good service.  That was the motivation.  Mr. O'Brien said quite diligently and proudly that he had not received the information on the disclosure until 10 March.  I will check the record, but I am sure it was 10 March.

At that stage, the report in question was the Conal Devine report.

When Dignam later reported, he said there were considerable issues around procurement.

Consequently we have accepted the conclusions of Mr. Conor Dignam SC, that it would be appropriate to ensure that what had been custom and practice was properly reflected in the internal regulations.  He also accepted that the circumstances in this case were such as to amount to exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the procurement policy and the National Financial Regulations Act of the HSE, thereby permitting a derogation from normal procedures.  He then says:<\/p><blockquote>It does seem to me that the HSE was justified of derogating from the normal process and in those circumstances was not obliged to engage in a tender process.  Indeed I agree with the HSE submission that such a tender process would probably have been inappropriate and unworkable given the subject matter.  There was therefore no inadequacy in relation to complying with the relevant procurement rules, arising from the fact that the contract was not the subject of an open tender.  One can readily see why such a process would have been wholly inappropriate.<\/blockquote> <p>He also says later on, and I cannot quote the precise words right now, in relation to Dignam that it represented fair value for money. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>On reports that have stayed on the shelf and were not acted on in any respect, I want to focus clearly on this -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>Can I just say ------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I do not want to stray into -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#BBB02600","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>It did not just stay on the shelf.

He has at least clarified the original question he was asked by Deputy Deasy, notwithstanding Mr. O'Brien's contention that he had a view that the Deputy was talking about other people or at least that Mr. O'Brien had different people in his mind, which is hard to understand.  Anyway, we have dealt with that now.  I have two simple, direct questions for Mr. O'Brien before I conclude, as I want to let other people in.  I still find it hard to understand and it beggars belief that so much time passed from the point the Devine report was furnished to the HSE and the time Mr. O'Brien says today a decision was made in February 2015 to put in place or in train a query to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether the HSE could publish the report.  It is incredible it was not done before then.  From 2012 to that date, the report sat on a shelf.  The reason it sat on a shelf is because the HSE let it sit on a shelf.  That chimes with what many people allege, which is that there was a cover-up within the HSE, because they cannot understand why the report was not published.  Mr. O'Brien says the report was not published because of standard practice but that is not what he said when he was before the committee in the past.  I want him clearly to answer the question as to why he did not seek the advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to March 2015 and why the report was left sitting on a shelf for that time period.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the funding issue that was asked about recently.  My understanding is that there has been no contact within the local office of the HSE and the service providers.  If that is inaccurate, can Mr. O'Brien point out the level of interaction and engagement with the local office and the service providers in question with regard to funding and whether there is still an outstanding issue or dispute regarding the funding?  Specifically, I ask about the contact between the local office and the service providers.  Those are two clear questions and I will finish on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#EEE02700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490259600,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>I will answer the Deputy's questions.  I preface that by saying it is not accurate to say the Devine report has sat on a shelf.  It was provided to the Garda at the time and the recommendations within it were being implemented even while it was not published.  As I told the Deputy earlier in respect of the period before the approach to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in February 2015, the HSE was doing exactly what it and the health boards had previously done in situations where there were live Garda investigations.  It is often described as \"first principles\" that one would not expect to publish a report which might have an adverse bearing on a Garda investigation.  I remind the Deputy, if I may, of the extracts I quoted from the Dignam report which described that approach in particular in the context of the advice received as a perfectly reasonable one.  Also, the view was put forward that if any earlier request for the written advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been made, it was reasonable to suppose that exactly the same response would have been received.<\/p><p>When I gave evidence here in 2016, I was referring to the reality, which is documented, that from the point at which I initiated proceedings to get the formal advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was strongly objecting to the publication of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017032300002#EEE02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490259600,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>Can I make one point?

That is very honest of Mr. O'Brien.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider what Dignam said about the report.  In 2009 the HSE set up the Devine inquiry to investigate the case of Grace, omitting the other 46 allegations.  The Dignam report stated \"the adoption of Terms of Reference by the HSE which led to this focus, means that the approach adopted to the Inquiry by the HSE was inadequate in all the circumstances.\"  These inadequate terms of reference were designed by the designated person from the serious incident management team in line with procedure.  This person was referenced previously in other evidence; his name is Ger Crowley.  He helped set up the terms of reference for the Devine inquiry into the Grace case and was centrally involved.<\/p> <p>  He then retired from the HSE and set up Resilience Ireland.  That organisation then got a contract to do a desktop review of the 46 others left out of the terms of reference of the Devine inquiry for which he was already involved in setting up the terms of reference.  He subsequently retired, which is fine, and then was part of an organisation, as a director.  He got the contract to do the work.  He recommended a further review, that is, visiting the other 46 cases.  Then, subsequently, his company got the contract to do this work.  However, the Dignam report found that there was no reason not to get three quotes.  Of course, the argument Mr. O'Brien made and will subsequently make after answering this question, I am sure, is that this was because the HSE was in a hurry etc.  While the HSE might not have got three quotes - Mr. O'Brien outlined the culture that existed - did it get even one quote for the work?

However, we can never forget the role Mr. McGuinness played in bringing peace to this island through his negotiation skills and willingness to partake in the very delicate and difficult process leading to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and, indeed, his continued work since then to ensure its implementation.  It is up to all of us, North and South, to ensure that the legacy of that good work continues.

We particularly convey our condolences to the families of the four people killed and our sincere hopes and prayers for a speedy recovery for all those injured.  An Irish person is among the injured.  I propose that the committee should write to the British Ambassador to Ireland, Robin Barnett, expressing our abhorrence of this terrorist attack and conveying our sympathies to our colleagues in the British Parliament, a number of whom were here yesterday at a meeting of the Good Friday Agreement committee at which we discussed Brexit and outlined the difficulties we had and what we wanted to see arising from Brexit.

I welcome this opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence, to consider the 2017 Revised Estimates for Vote 35, Army Pensions and Vote 36, Defence.  I have a short opening statement which will set out the overall position and update the members on some of the main developments within the defence sector over recent times.  Before I conclude my opening statement, I will refer to the tragic events related to the loss of Rescue 116 off the west coast.  <\/p><p>The defence sector is made up of two votes &ndash; Vote 35, Army Pensions and Vote 36, Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to <i>&quot;provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government&rsquo;&quot;.  <\/i>Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.  The combined Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions for 2017 provides for gross expenditure of some &euro;922 million.<\/p><p>The Defence Vote of &euro;692 million includes a pay and allowances allocation of some &euro;497 million, while the remaining non-pay allocation of &euro;195 million provides mainly for the renewal and maintenance of essential equipment, infrastructure and operational costs.<\/p><p> The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2017 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;230 million for the Army pensions Vote.  More than &euro;220 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.<\/p><p> Having outlined the broad financial parameters of both Votes, I will now address some of the main features of the single programme on the Defence Vote, programme A, defence policy and support, military capabilities and operational outputs.<\/p><p> The defence pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of a Permanent Defence Force strength of up to 9,500, 550 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 Army nurses.  This level of funding provides the defence organisation with the resources necessary for it to deliver effectively on all its key domestic and international responsibilities.<\/p><p> An ongoing and increasing level of recruitment has been taking place within the Defence Forces in recent years.  To this end, I recently launched the 2017 recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces which targets the induction of some 860 new entrants across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service this year.  Permanent Defence Force strengths are not yet at the target levels.  However, funding is in place, and this year's recruitment programme highlights my commitment to a Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500.  These recruits will avail of the highest levels of training and, in return, the Defence Forces will benefit through the injection of energy and enthusiasm, which every organisation, particularly the Defence Forces, needs.  Promotions are also ongoing, with over 1,400 promotions across all areas of the Defence Forces since 2014.<\/p><p> The budget allocation also provides for a Reserve Defence Force, RDF, pay allocation of more than &euro;2 million which will provide for 26,000 training days in 2017.  I acknowledge and appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of the RDF members who provide voluntary service throughout the country and I welcome the fact that this allocation provides a minimum of seven days' annual paid training for all effective members of the reserve, as well as providing for 14 days' paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the reserve in 2017.  In line with RDF priorities, this will also facilitate selected members to participate in career and specialist courses, as required.<\/p><p> The defence non-pay allocation comprises current and capital elements.  The current expenditure allocation of &euro;121 million provides mainly for expenditure on essential and ongoing Defence Forces' standing and operational costs, such as those relating to utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.<\/p><p> The capital expenditure allocation of &euro;74 million provides for the necessary procurement and upgrading of defensive equipment and infrastructure and represents a welcome increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 defence allocation contained in the capital investment programme for the period 2016 to 2021.  This increase is essential to ensure that the Defence Forces have the necessary levels of equipment in place to allow them to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.  Among the main equipment programme priorities planned for 2017 are the continuation of the naval vessel replacement programme; the armoured personnel carrier, APC, mid-life extension programme; the aircraft replacement programme; the purchase of armoured utility vehicles; and the acquisition of armoured logistic vehicles for overseas missions.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces built infrastructure allocation of &euro;14 million has increased significantly over the 2016 position and will facilitate continuing infrastructural developments across military locations.  A number of projects are planned for 2017, which are progressing on a phased basis, to upgrade and maintain the infrastructure essential for the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> Last year, in the context of the 2016 Estimates, I informed the committee that a contract had been signed with Babcock International for the provision of a fourth ship under the naval vessel replacement programme at a cost of &euro;67 million.  I am delighted to say that significant progress has been made since, and on 28 February last I attended the keel-laying ceremony at Babcock's shipbuilding yard in Devon, where I announced that the ship would bear the name of the renowned Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw.  Payments of &euro;28 million under this contract are scheduled for 2017, and by 2018 the naval vessel replacement programme will have delivered four new ships at a cost of some &euro;266 million.  The naval vessel replacement programme represents excellent value for money, and these ships will be of major benefit to the State and a further significant enhancement of defence capabilities.  The acquisition of these new ships has facilitated the participation of the Naval Service in its deployment to assist with rescue missions arising from the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.  To date, these missions have led to the rescue of more than 15,600 migrants.<\/p><p> Last year, I commissioned the new Defence Forces International Operational Service Medal to recognise the service of Defence Forces personnel who have been deployed on overseas missions by direction of the Government where no other mission medal has been awarded.  This medal was awarded to all personnel who took part in search-and-rescue activities in the Mediterranean during 2015 and 2016.<\/p><p> I will now briefly outline some of the key roles and outputs delivered under the defence programme.  The Defence Forces continue to make a considerable contribution in their international peace and security role, and at 1 March 2017 Ireland was contributing 585 Defence Forces personnel to ten different missions across the globe.  In addition, personnel are deployed to a range of international organisations and national representations.<\/p><p> The main overseas mission on which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 378 personnel.  Since 22 November 2016, when Ireland assumed the lead of the joint battalion in UNIFIL from Finland, Ireland's contribution to UNIFIL has increased by some 150 personnel.  Ireland is also contributing 136 personnel to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in the Golan Heights.  I have already referenced the contribution made by the Naval Service in its deployment to the Mediterranean, and the issue of a further deployment in 2017 will be considered shortly.<\/p><p> The Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for Ireland's domestic security, supported, as required, by the Defence Forces as part of their aid to the civil power function.  This role is multifaceted and in 2016 included a varied set of tasks such as Garda air support missions, Central Bank security guards, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal call-outs and Naval Service diving operations.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces also provide assistance to the principal response agencies tasked with responding to major emergencies.  By way of example, in 2016, the Defence Forces were deployed on a number of missing persons searches, the Naval Service conducted fisheries boardings and the Air Corps undertook a number of emergency aeromedical support missions.  The professional competence shown by the Defence Forces in undertaking these roles is greatly valued and appreciated by all stakeholders.<\/p><p> Last year was of huge historical importance and, in this context, I express my sincere gratitude to the Defence Forces for their outstanding contribution to the many ceremonial events undertaken.  Their input contributed significantly to numerous ceremonial highlights throughout 2016, with the full military display involving 2,500 military personnel undertaken on Easter Sunday, rightly receiving universal acclaim for its dignified, respectful and inclusive salute to our historic past.  I feel it was only right and fitting, therefore, as part of the Ireland 2016 centenary programme and in line with the programme for Government commitment, that all serving members of the Defence Forces were presented with a specially commissioned medal to mark their role in these ceremonies.<\/p><p> Civil Defence is also funded from the defence Vote and remains a vital component within each local authority's emergency response arrangements.  During 2016, Civil Defence volunteers provided ongoing support and front-line emergency assistance at many commemorative events throughout the country.  In recognition of their efforts, I commissioned a specially-designed medal to be presented to all members of Civil Defence who were in active service between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016.<\/p><p> Finally, I turn to programme A, provision for Defence Forces' pensions benefits, of Vote 35.  Expenditure under Vote 35 is demand-driven and non-discretionary, with superannuation benefits - pensions and gratuities - and disability pensions, etc., accounting for 99% of all expenditure.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.<\/p><p>Some 2,700 military personnel have retired on pensions from January 2010 to date and currently 12,250 pensioners are paid from the Army pensions Vote.  There is a net increase of 1,250 since 2007.  All the indications are that this underlying trend will be maintained in the coming years.  For the years 2017 to 2019, inclusive, current projections are that 1,000 military personnel will retire on pension.  Last year, 2016, saw 330 Defence Forces members retire on pension, with a similar number anticipated in 2017.  As the committee is aware, it has been my stated intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall budgetary negotiations, and some progress has been made on that front.  As announced in budget 2017, the gross allocation for Army pensions has been increased by &euro;6 million to &euro;230 million for this year, a welcome change.<\/p><p> I have broadly outlined the key inputs, outputs and performance indicators for the defence sector.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on the individual subheads for the Defence and Army pensions Estimates.  I look forward to positive engagement on any issues the committee may wish to discuss.<\/p><p> Before I conclude I want to comment on the tragic events off the west coast.  I want to express my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Chief Pilot Mark Duffy, winchman Paul Ormsby and winchman Ciar&aacute;n Smith - the crew involved in this tragic incident - as well as to the staff of the Irish Coast Guard.  I recognise the efforts of everyone involved in the recovery operation in a dangerous environment.  In particular, I acknowledge the Defence Forces personnel who are assisting with the recovery operation through the provision of Naval Service ships and Air Corps aircraft.  Naval Service divers are also contributing their skills to the rescue mission.  It is important that those involved in the investigation process are given time and space to complete their work and to establish the full facts of this tragic event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#A00100","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

No members of the Irish Defence Forces are in Afghanistan at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the RDF.  First, I recognise the value of the important work that the Reserve Defence Force has played and continues to play in contributing to Ireland's defence capability.  As I have said on previous occasions, I admire the voluntary service of the members to the Defence Forces.  I am the first to recognise that 2017 was not the greatest year for recruiting members to the RDF.  I was listening to committee hearings recently and this was one of the major issues raised.  Having said that, I reassure the Deputy that the members of the RDF play an important role.  That much was stated in the White Paper published in 2015.  The White Paper commits to the retention and development of the Reserve Defence Force.  I acknowledge the problems around the inducting and recruitment of the reserve.<\/p> <p>  I have made this a priority during 2017.  I was appointed in May 2016.  There was not a great deal of change at that stage.  From the time of my appointment there were issues up until the end of 2016, especially issues relating to induction.  I have had conversations and meetings with the Secretary General and his assistants.  I have also met the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff to ensure this is made a priority in 2017 and to ensure we get in the required number.  There are issues around inducting personnel relating to Garda clearance and security.  We are recruiting for the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  As members are aware, every organisation has issues around Garda checks and security and so on.  I have to ensure all safety checks and security checks have been carried out effectively on all people who have been recruited to the Reserve Defence Force.  Having said that, this is a priority for me for 2017.  There were issues in 2016 and I want to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#C00600","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy.

This is probably indicative of the fact that we are losing people at an alarming rate.  This has been discussed at previous meetings.  I note the efforts of the Department and the RDF to increase recruitment.  There are still a number of problems.  It is not progressing at the rate it should be.<\/p> <p>  In terms of man-days allocated, while there are an initial seven days of paid training and up to a further 28 days of paid training for each reservist upon application by his or her unit, the lack of flexibility in those man-days is a difficulty.  There may be individuals in the unit who are able to give more than 28 days.  In the spirit of volunteerism, I do not see the difficulty with that.  During my time in the RDF, it was a lot easier to do additional man-days if one had the ability to volunteer more of one's time, whether that was because one had lost a job, was unemployed, in college or for any other reason.  At certain times during their lives, people have more time to give to the organisation and that should be welcomed.  However, there is no flexibility.  When a unit is assigned a certain number of man-days, it often hands back almost half of them because those that are able to give active service that year use up their man-days and they are unable to access any more.  A little change like that would make a big difference.  The estimated spend on the RDF for 2016 was &euro;2.1 million.  We only actually spent &euro;1.5 million.  The money is there.  We are really short on bodies.  It is difficult to run a training camp or a course if people cannot attend.  If we provided more flexibility in respect of man-days so that those that are able to give more time are allowed to give more time and units can allocate those man-days more freely, it would go a long way towards addressing some of the problems within the individual units.  That one small change would have a massive impact.<\/p> <p>  A number of years ago reservists received what was called a gratuity payment.  It was not big money.  In the region of &euro;600 was paid to each reservist around Christmas time if he or she had completed his or her two weeks of annual training that year.  Not every reservist would qualify.  When a reservist goes on a training camp or a course for a week or two he or she is taking time out of his or her civilian employment.  Therefore, his or her salary or wages are down or he or she is taking a week's holidays.  Reservists' pay is then taxed quite heavily.  People at the rank of sergeant or higher come out with maybe &euro;200 after a week's training.  These people pay for fuel to get to and from the location.  They often purchase their own equipment.  We know the difficulties in terms of personal protective equipment, PPE.  A lot of reservists purchase their own boots, their own warm gear and their own wet gear.  The gratuity payment at the end of the year meant reservists bore the cost of the training camp earlier in the year.  Volunteering should not be so costly.  It now costs people to be a member of the RDF.  The gratuity payment is small money in terms of defence spending but it was a thank you payment for the effort put in by those who had done the required training and service during the year.  Again, this would be a minor change for small money.  It is raised time and time again by every reservist that I talk to.  The State showing their appreciation for the volunteerism displayed by members of the RDF would mean a lot to them.<\/p> <p>  I join with the Minister of State, the Department, the Defence Forces and the committee in offering my deepest sympathies to the families of Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith.  It is an absolute tragedy.  I appreciate that the rescue and search efforts are still ongoing.  I wholeheartedly commend the efforts of every organisation taking part in the search.  It is fantastic and amazing to see the different agencies working together using their expertise and the available equipment to make the best effort we can as a State.  It is important to note the efforts of locals in the Erris region.  Local fishermen have been on site conducting the search efforts as best they can and local people have been providing food, warm drinks and assistance in whatever way they can.  It has been an amazing community effort in that area.  As a representative from County Mayo, I know it has hit the community there very hard.  It will leave a lasting mark on our community.<\/p> <p>  In the briefing documents supplied, it is noted that the operational flight hours of the Air Corps in 2014 were 5,009.  In 2016 they dropped to 4,286.  Why have they been reduced?  I doubt there is a need to reduce the hours.  Is it down to a lack of resources and capabilities?  In light of recent reports which confirm the inadequate resourcing of Defence Forces units, such as those involving pilots and air traffic controllers, what measures is the Department taking to resolve the manpower shortages being experienced by the Air Corps?  This is not something that has been discovered in the past few weeks.  The issue of resourcing and manpower shortages in the Air Corps has been known for quite some time.  It must be addressed with absolute urgency.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the issue of the health concerns of those who were in contact with hazardous material a number of years ago.  Has the Minister of State had an opportunity to consider whether it might be prudent for the Department and the State to conduct a health review of those that feel they were affected and may possibly have experienced adverse health effects due to their contact with hazardous chemicals?  This was done in Australia when a similar situation occurred there.  An appropriate health package could be put in place for affected individuals.<\/p> <p>  I have asked the question previously, but I would like to get an update from the Minister of State and the Department as to whether the potential impact of Brexit in terms of defence policy and our Defence Forces has been analysed?  What are the Department's preparations for Brexit?<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister of State has been contacted, as have many of us, by those involved in the Jadotville siege and their families.  There is huge unhappiness and disappointment at the manner in which the issue of the service medals was dealt with.  Would the Minister of State seek the establishment, under the Defence Forces regulations, of a board of military officers to review the recommendations made in the original 2004 review of the events at Jadotville?  Perhaps they reached the right conclusion.  It is not for me to decide or judge.  I can tell the Minister of State that I have been inundated with representations on this issue.  I do not see the difficulty in looking back at the decision taken in 2004 and assessing whether the right call was made.  If not, we can address that.  It would be in the interests of the citizens of the State, those that served during that time and their family members.  There is no shame in saying that the wrong call was made.  Perhaps it was not.  I do not see the difficulty in looking back to see if we did the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#D00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1532,"content":"<p>Deputy Lisa Chambers asked about service medals and Jadotville in particular.  In recognition of the mission in Jadotville and the contribution that members of the Irish Defence Forces made, I made this a priority when I came into the Department.  This issue has gone on for many years and has been dealt with by many Ministers.  I have asked the Chief of Staff to see what records there are relating to the battle of Jadotville in order to discover if we can recognise the soldiers' work and commitment during their mission.<\/p><p>Deputy Chambers will be well aware as a former member of the Reserve Defence Force of the regulations around medals and that has to be respected also.  I assure the Deputy that this matter is ongoing within my own Department and within the Defence Forces.  We will continue to examine whether they can be awarded some form of medal.  Personally, I would not like to see just three or four people getting medals.  We have to recognise all the members who made a contribution to Jadotville because they all made a huge contribution in their own way.<\/p><p> On Brexit, colleagues will be aware that the Prime Minister of the UK said she will trigger Article 50 shortly, although I am not sure if that will happen because of events yesterday.  That is a matter for the British Government.  Let me assure the Deputy that I have assigned a senior person within my Department to deal with all Brexit-related matters.  This person is supported by a number of others in all branches within the Department and the Defence Forces.  The managing board is also acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight of all issues that are arising at present.  I and senior officials within my Department have had a number of meetings with the Department of the Taoiseach.   Once Article 50 is moved upon and the negotiations begin, we will be very much involved and will be ready.<\/p><p> Regarding the issues around the Air Corps, as the Deputy well knows and as I have stated on numerous occasions, there is a shortage of pilots.  That is an issue I am trying to address but it cannot be addressed overnight.  We have eight cadets going through at the moment and pilots coming on each year.  It takes five years before a pilot is fully trained up and qualified to fly any form of aircraft.  I am addressing the issue but it will take quite some time to get back to full strength.  That is the reason there has been a lowering of flying hours within the Air Corps.<\/p><p> On the Reserve Defence Force, as I stated to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan before she left, this a priority for me in 2017.  I know Deputy Chambers asked for specifics around training days, the spending of the budget, the gratuity payment and so on.  One thing I do not want to lose is the whole voluntary ethos around the Reserve Defence Force.  People join for the right reasons when they join as volunteers.  I do not want people to lose that special ethos.  I will look at the issues the Deputy raised around the gratuity.<\/p><p> On the number of training days, during 2016, a total of 1,298 Reserve personnel undertook paid training days and a total of 19,710 training man days were used up.  Similarly to the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive, not all of the allocation of 2016 was used up.  This is reflected in an underspend of &euro;582,000 in the Reserve budget in 2016.  The Deputy raised specific issues about whether we can use up the underspend or savings.  I will examine the matter.  I have spoken to senior people in my Department, the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff about how we can improve the terms and conditions, recruitment and everything relating to the Reserve.  I want to make sure this is prioritised in 2017.  Even though we have a great number of people applying for the Reserve, when it comes to having the medical exams and things like that, many people fall off.  I want to find out if the process is taking so long that we are losing people.  I am not sure what the issues are in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#D00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1534,"content":"<p>I have a couple of follow-up questions.  The Minister of State did not answer my question about the health review and the hazardous materials at Casement Aerodrome.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the gratuity payment, there is no fear of losing the voluntary ethos.  This payment was always there.  It was only taken away when the country hit crisis point and we had to save money.  As somebody who has served in the Reserve, I can tell the Minister that it is quite an expensive thing to do.  It costs money to be a member.  People are paying for equipment and taking time off work.  The gratuity payment just balanced it out.  Restoring it would not affect the volunteerism.  The issue is coming up all the time.  No one is in the Reserve for the money - I guarantee the Minister that.  It is a minor amount of money which people would only get if they did their two weeks' training.  They have taken the financial hit with their two weeks' training; they have taken time off work, lost their wages and are getting taxed heavily.  When I was in the Reserve in the early days, the payment used to come at the end of the training period.  Then it changed and people got it at the end of the year.  That did not make a huge amount of difference, and people were fine about getting it at the end of the year.  It helped balance out the cost of being in the organisation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the man days, all I am suggesting is that many days are being handed back and there are people who would take them on.  I am not suggesting the Minister gives a serving member - man or woman - the ability to do six months in the Reserve Defence Force and make a career out of it.  A period of 28 days is quite restrictive.  If someone does a two week training course such as a career course, as a corporal or sergeant, and then wants to do the two weeks' annual training in the summer, they cannot then do the Easter or winter camp.  It is just the basic weeks of training.  It is difficult for any unit, particularly in rural communities, to get the numbers to turn up.  People have different things going on in their lives.  When we have people active and willing to give the extra time, it is very difficult to run a camp if only five people turn up and there are others sitting at home who would love to go and cannot.  A bit of flexibility is needed.  I ask the Minister to increase the 28 days by adding an extra two or three weeks.  That is not a huge amount but it would allow units to use the man days that they have.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has asked us to give him recommendations.

A powerful presentation was made to the committee about this recently and I am sure the Minister has read the transcript.  Many issues were raised but one was that if people are in receipt for a social welfare payment and do the training, the payment ceases but they are not paid for the duration of training, which is a considerable time.  Losing a few weeks income when someone is on a low income is not acceptable.  I pointed out that day that cheques for personnel in the Department, the Permanent Defence Force and ourselves are in our bank accounts at the end of every month.  It is not acceptable that people on low incomes should have to wait a number of weeks to resume social welfare payments.  That seems to be a case of bad administration within the Department if the way I took the issue up is accurate.  Surely there is a way to amend that.  If a person completes a week's training, there should not be a delay in his or her payment.  Others members and I have outlined previously to the Minister of State the value we attach to the RDF.  I instanced many young people where I come from who would have been vulnerable were it not the opportunity they were given in the Reserve to participate and play a good role in society.<\/p> <p>  Three Bills - the Red Cross Bill, the Defences Forces (forensic evidence) Bill and the Defence (amendment) Bill - seem to be going backwards every year.

When Operation Pontus began in 2015 we had 1,204 patrol days and in 2016 when the operation continued we were able to proceed with 1,376 patrol days.  A total of 1,079 fishery vessel boardings were carried out in 2015 and 1,249 in 2016.  We work very closely with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, regarding patrol days and fishery vessel boardings.

The report for 2015 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 September 2016 and the following motion has been placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2015, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 September 2016, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006.<\/blockquote> <p>In commending the motion, I will outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the UN over the past couple of years.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland reaffirmed this commitment in the Government's most recent White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015.  The White Paper on Defence sets out the policy framework for the defence organisation until 2025 and beyond.<\/p><p>Ireland's commitment to the United Nations has found expression in its longstanding tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, a service which has comprised over 65,000 individual tours of duty.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU.  During 2015, the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN led and UN authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on nine different missions throughout the world, in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  In addition, members of the Permanent Defence Force were also deployed on humanitarian missions in Sierra Leone and in the Mediterranean in 2015.  Ireland's main commitments during 2015 were to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment.<\/p><p>Following a request from the United Nations, a contingent of Defence Forces personnel was deployed to UNIFIL in mid-2011.  Between June 2012 and November 2013, Ireland served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion when a contingent of the Finnish Armed Forces began serving alongside Irish soldiers working to support UNIFIL's mission mandate.  Also, Ireland held command of the joint Irish-Finnish battalion during that period.  Finland, in accordance with agreements entered into on the deployment of the joint battalion, assumed command on 26 November 2013.  Since May 2015, the Finnish battalion has included an Estonian platoon.  Throughout 2015, a contingent comprising approximately 200 Defence Forces personnel was deployed to the UNIFIL mission.  There were two rotations of Irish personnel to UNIFIL in 2015 comprising the 49th Infantry Group and the 51st Infantry Group, each with approximately 185 personnel.  Also, a number of Defence Forces personnel served at UNIFIL sector west headquarters in Shama and at the force headquarters in Naqoura.<\/p><p>Partnership with like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  The joint participation of Ireland, Finland and Estonia in the UNIFIL mission is but one example that demonstrates our joint contribution to international peace and security.  In the absence of partners, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be notably curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability, build experience, significantly contribute to the range and nature of operations we can undertake in support of the United Nations and further deepen the excellent relationship between our countries.<\/p><p>Ireland formally took over command of the Irish-Finnish battalion on 22 November 2016, at which time an additional company of approximately 150 personnel were deployed as part of the battalion.  This brings the current number of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL up to some 380.  An Irish officer, Major General Michael Beary, took over as head of mission and force commander of UNIFIL in July 2016.  At the request of the UN, his appointment has been extended until July 2018.  It is a great honour for our country to have Major General Beary occupying this prestigious post and is an indication of the high regard in which Irish personnel are held internationally.  It has been 30 years since an Irish person last held this post.  The situation in Lebanon continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security.  In this connection, the United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2017.<\/p><p>Ireland's second largest overseas deployment in 2015 was to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The Defence Forces contribution to UNDOF in 2015 comprised the 48th Infantry Group and the 50th Infantry Group, each of which consists of approximately 130 personnel.  The Infantry Group operated in the role of a quick reaction force on stand-by to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF area of responsibility.  There were eight Defence Forces personnel occupying staff appointments at UNDOF's Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  At the request of the UN, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon had his appointment as deputy force commander of UNDOF extended to 21 May 2016.  I take this opportunity to thank Brigadier General Hanlon for his contribution to the success of the mission and wish him every success in the future. <\/p><p>The security situation in UNDOF's area of operations is continually reviewed by the UN and the Defence Forces.  The continued presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region and is supported and welcomed by both Syria and Israel.  Ireland continued to contribute military observers and staff to various United Nations missions such as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, throughout the year under review.  The 13 Irish personnel deployed to that mission in 2015 included the head of mission and Chief of Staff of UNTSO, Major General Michael Finn.  Major General Finn was appointed head of mission of UNTSO by the UN in July 2013 and had his appointment extended for a further period until the end of July 2015.  I thank Major General Finn for his contribution to the success of the mission and wish him every success in the future.  At the request of the United Nations, an Irish officer, Colonel Eamon Caulfield, was appointed as deputy chief of staff of UNTSO in September 2015.<\/p><p>I have just returned from a visit to the Middle East where I visited personnel serving with the UN missions in Lebanon and Israel.<\/p><p>I also attended St Patrick's Day events in the region as part of Ireland's overall economic, political and security engagement in the region.  It was a valuable opportunity to be briefed on the position and the challenges facing the respective missions in the area.<br\/><br\/>During 2015, Defence Forces officers continued to serve with MINURSO, the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara; MONUSCO, the UN stabilisation mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and UNOCl, the UN operation in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire.  Ireland contributed ten personnel to the EU training mission in Mali in 2015.  The objective of the mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian armed forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian state.  In October 2016, I had an opportunity to meet Irish personnel serving with the mission.  Currently, 18 Irish Defence Forces personnel are deployed with the mission.  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2015 were the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with seven personnel; the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 12 personnel; and the resolute support mission, RSM, in Afghanistan, with seven personnel.  The personnel serving with RSM completed their service on 10 March 2016, when Ireland withdrew from the mission.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the deployment of Defence Forces personnel to humanitarian missions in 2015, three Naval Service vessels were deployed to the Mediterranean between May and November of that year to assist the Italian authorities with the migrant crisis.  Irish participation in the humanitarian mission resulted in the rescue of more than 8,500 migrants, which clearly demonstrates the value of Ireland's involvement in this important humanitarian response.  I had the opportunity to travel to Sardinia in September 2016 to meet Naval Service personnel crewing <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>and be briefed on the mission.  I commend all involved in 2015 and 2016 on the outstanding role they played in saving the lives of so many men, women and children, many of whom were fleeing desperate circumstances.  Five Defence Forces personnel were also deployed to Sierra Leone in January 2015 where they served as part of a UK-led joint inter-agency task force tackling Ebola in west Africa.  The Defence Forces completed their service with that mission on 15 September 2015.<br\/><br\/>The current contribution of 585 personnel to overseas missions is a very significant contribution in the context of the resources available for defence.  It reflects the Government's continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  It is important for Ireland to continue to build on our long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel to peace support operations.  Relative to our size and our available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.  Overseas service has become a core activity of the Defence Forces.  Ireland's record of service in UN-authorised peace support operations is second to none.  The Defence Forces have made and continue to make a significant contribution to such operations throughout the world.  The Government places high importance on the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  During my visit to the UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNTSO missions last week and my visit to Sardinia in September 2016 and to EUTM Mali in October 2016, I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.  I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  I assure the committee that the Government is committed to ensuring the Defence Forces continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the significant demands placed on personnel who serve overseas and specifically on their families.  Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas under the auspices of the United Nations would not be possible.  Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well, not alone on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole, and contributes to the excellent reputation that Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world.  I commend the motion to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017032300002#H01000","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee I record our appreciation of the very significant role played by so many members of the Permanent Defence Force in overseas missions.

There is no doubt that our participation in overseas missions by our soldiers greatly enhances the professional capacity and capabilities of the Defence Forces, which is not to be underestimated.  It is a fantastic opportunity for our personnel to travel overseas and gain international experience working with other armed forces, learning and building knowledge all the time.

Very often, there is ignorance of what the Defence Forces are about, the comprehensive duties they perform throughout the world and the reputation they have gained for the work they do.  It benefits Ireland's reputation as well but it is very often forgotten.  People ask why we have Defence Forces but there is a role we play in peacekeeping and promoting Ireland as a country that is concerned about the rest of the world.  We are not just a little island in the Atlantic.  We should not hide our light under a bushel on this issue.

I congratulate the Minister of State on what is a comprehensive report.  It should be placed on the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il and time allocated to debate it.

In 2014 the cost was &euro;28 million.  We got back &euro;6.1 million from the United Nations.  When salaries and every other expense were taken out, the cost was &euro;9.9 million.  In 2015, after taking everything out, including the UN contribution, the cost was &euro;10.9 million and in 2016, &euro;12 million.  Whether they were based at home or abroad, we would have been paying their salaries.<\/p> <p>  I thank all members for their comments.  In response to the Chairman, there is a UN resolution on the participation of women in the Defence Forces overseas.  I attended a conference in the United Kingdom in June or July last year to discuss the gender issue.  We have introduced family friendly arrangements, whereby a man or a woman can serve for three months and be replaced by another person for a further three months during a six-month rotation.  There is one joint UNIFIL battalion with the Finns in Lebanon.  That is the only one in which we participate or plan to do so.  <\/p> <p>  I receive risk assessments, as appropriate, when I ask for them, but there are continuous risk assessments in the Defence Forces, carried out in conjunction with the United Nations.  When we send personnel overseas, what is most important for me is that they receive specific training and equipment and that I be happy with the risk assessment and information I received from the Defence Forces.  When I visit Lebanon or the Golan Heights and meet the mayors and mukhtars of the local communities, they very much appreciate Ireland's participation for many years, specifically in Lebanon where Irish personnel lost their lives.  When we send personnel abroad, we have to think, first, of their families and the people they are leaving behind and their commitment to hold the fort at home.  Many of those who go away on a tour of duty have children.  Six months is a long time to be away from their families, even allowing for annual leave.  This is very much appreciated and I know that it is appreciated by all members of the committee.  Irish personnel are recognised for their peacekeeping duties and skills wherever they participate.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett suggested we have a debate or make statements on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  I would be delighted to do so and will write to the Chief Whip to ask that she make time available for statements.  If other members speak to their Whips, we might have an hour or two because it is very important that we promote the Defence Forces.  People ask me about the Army and it is only when I explain the great work it does abroad and they see it on television that they really appreciate it.

I am accompanied today by Ms Deirdre Aherne, assistant principal in the credit union policy section of the Department.<\/p> <p>  We will first comment on the role of the Department of Finance.  As the committee is aware, the Department's role is the provision of high quality information, advice and analysis on credit union policy matters to the Minister and to oversee and implement policy and legislation relevant to the credit union sector.  The credit union policy team within my division is well resourced and is headed by Mr. Brian Corr, who, unfortunately, is unavailable to be here today due to work commitments in Brussels.  Along with Mr. Corr and Ms Aherne, the team also has a higher executive officer, Mr. Tom Byrne, and an executive officer, Ms Joan Finnerty.  In addition, the credit unit team can freely draw on the resources and expertise within my division and the wider Department.  In order to assist our work we have ongoing communication with credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and other credit union stakeholders on a wide range of matters, both formally and informally, and we regularly attend at sectoral events.  My statement will cover five separate areas that I believe will be of interest to the committee.  These are an overview of our recent work in the Department of Finance; the Commission on Credit Unions report; credit union restructuring; the credit union advisory committee's report, recommendations and the implementation group; and challenges and changes in the sector.<\/p> <p>  The first topic is our recent work.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s position, the Department believes credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities.  The Government has put in place a number of measures to ensure credit unions can continue to provide these services to their members and ensure the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions in 2011; the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, in 2013; the availability of &euro;500 million to support the stability of the credit union movement; the introduction of the stabilisation support scheme; the request to the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, to review all recommendations in the commission report; and the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of CUAC&rsquo;s recommendations.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Commission on Credit Unions, on the publication of the programme for Government for 2011 to 2016, the Government agreed to establish a commission on credit unions to review the future of credit unions and to make recommendations on the most effective regulatory structure, taking account of their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members&rsquo; savings and financial stability.<\/p><p>The report of the commission includes recommendations on a broad range of measures, including governance, prudential regulations, restructuring and stabilisation.  More than 60 of the recommendations were implemented in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, the first new legislation in 15 years specifically for credit unions. <br\/><br\/>One core recommendation of the commission was for the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, to facilitate and oversee restructuring of the sector.  The commission was clear that restructuring was to be carried out on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  Accordingly, ReBo was established and during its four-year lifetime it has assisted in 82 completed mergers, involving 156 credit unions with combined assets in excess of &euro;6 billion, at a cost to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;20 million.  While not directly attributable to ReBo, at the end of September 2016, there were 48 credit unions with assets greater than &euro;100 million compared to 30 such credit unions in 2011, an increase of 60%.  On the other hand, there were 117 credit unions with assets of less than &euro;25 million in 2016 compared to 231 such credit unions in 2011, a 49% decrease.  While consolidation of the sector - to 283 active credit unions - has occurred, it is too early to assess whether the benefits of additional scale have been realised.  <br\/><br\/>ReBo is on course to complete the performance of its functions by 31 March 2017.  As part of our preparations for its eventual dissolution, I expect to bring a final report under section 43 of the 2012 Act to the Minister, following which the report will be laid before the Houses.  I understand the ReBo board will also publish a final non-statutory report of its work during 2017.  It is worth drawing to the attention of the committee that the Minister extended the deadline for credit unions to receive a letter of acceptance from ReBo, enabling them to merge with ReBo's assistance, from 31 December 2015 to 31 March 2016.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, is a committee established under section 180 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  The current CUAC was established in September 2014 and consists of three members, namely, Professor Donal McKillop, chair and professor of financial services in the school of management at Queen's University Belfast; Ms Denise O'Connell, partner, audit and assurance services, Grant Thornton; and Mr. Joe O'Toole, former Senator, who previously served as general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation and president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. <br\/><br\/>The Credit Union Advisory Committee presented its report - review of implementation of the recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions - to the Minister on 29 June 2016 with recommendations summarised under the following seven specific headings: tiered regulation; section 35; consultation and engagement with the Central Bank; governance; restructuring; business model development; and additional matters.  The report is available on the Department's website. <br\/><br\/>CUAC also recommended that an implementation group be established for a specified period of time to oversee and monitor implementation of those recommendations.  This recommendation has been accepted and I am pleased to report to the joint committee that the implementation group has been established.  It consists of representatives from the main credit union stakeholder bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, Credit Union Members Association, CUMA, and National Supervisors Forum, NSF - the Central Bank and the Credit Union Advisory Committee, and is chaired by the head of the credit union team in my division.  The implementation group held its inaugural meeting on 20 February 2017 and met again yesterday, primarily to discuss section 35.<br\/><br\/>I will now address section 35, which relates to lending limits.  CUAC recommended a review of section 35 and the implementation group will consider this matter in more detail.  In the year ended 30 September 2016, credit unions advanced &euro;2.2 billion in new lending, primarily unsecured consumer lending, with a total stock of loans at September 2016 of &euro;4.1 billion.  We estimate the market share of credit unions in the &euro;12 billion consumer lending market has risen from 29% in 2009 to approximately 35% in 2016.  Growing lending in a prudent manner is important to the sector as loan to asset ratios are too low, driven partly by a 50% contraction in consumer lending since 2009, increased competition in certain niches, such as new car finance, and growing deposits.  In other words, the denominator has increased and the numerator has decreased.  The challenge faced by credit unions is that funds not lent earn very low, if any, income in the current low interest rate environment and their growing deposits increase their asset base which, in turn, requires additional regulatory capital.<br\/><br\/>Under the 2016 regulations introduced by the Central Bank, credit unions are allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over ten years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions are able to apply for an extension to their longer-term lending limits, namely, up to 40% of their loan book over five years and up to 15% of their loan book over ten years.  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank and I understand there are 11 credit unions currently approved to avail of the increased limits.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that credit unions can provide mortgages to members and many do so.  However, there is a persuasive argument that the lending limits constrain upfront investment and this will form part of the implementation group discussions on section 35.  We all know from experience with the banking sector that mortgage lending is an activity that is by no means risk free and it is reasonable to state that proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be scrutinised carefully.  We are pleased to note proactive steps are being taken by the representative bodies to assist credit unions in building controls for the processing of mortgage lending, including underwriting and security documentation, both of which are complex areas in which credit unions currently have limited expertise.<br\/><br\/>While not part of the same process, the wider review of the mortgage market by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission may raise additional matters which would also need to be considered by the implementation group.  I fully expect the implementation group to progress the report's recommendations, including section 35, in the coming months.<br\/><br\/>On challenges and changes in the sector, w<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">e recognise the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and their role in communities and the financial sector more broadly.  We appreciate that there is significant diversity in many aspects of the business model for the 283 active credit unions.  These credit unions can be large or small, rural or urban, industrial or regional, and can have business models adapted to their particular membership base.  We understand the challenges this raises and that flexibility and proportionality are required both in policy and regulation to support this.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> In looking back at the 2011 position of credit unions, it is clear the sector overall has managed to come through the financial crisis much stronger than expected and we recognise this.  We also appreciate that the sector has undergone fundamental change since 2011, managing many complex and difficult issues including elevated arrears, reduced lending, an ageing membership base, low investment returns, restructuring activity and a more intrusive regulatory environment.  Further change is inevitable and we are playing a constructive role, together with the sector, <\/font>he Credit Union Advisory Committee<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and the Central Bank in supporting credit unions in continuing to progress and develop.  I thank members for their attention.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>Mr. Carville described credit unions as diverse and stated their mode of operation presents challenges in that there are 283 different boards and entities.

We want to hear what the stakeholders have to say and we want to ensure that there is a vibrant credit union movement into the future.  I am not convinced that a sunset is being put on actions or key deliverables within definitive and clearly defined timelines.  It seems from what Mr. Carville is saying that the Department is not a million miles away from understanding the needs of the credit union movement and realising the potential of the movement.  However, there is still a logjam.  This is why we are trying to go hard on the questioning here.  I suggest that tiered regulation is the nut that needs to be cracked.  The impression I get from the engagement of the Department and the Central Bank with the credit union movement is that one of them, or both, does not want to be dealing with 283 entities.  I think there is a certain attitude that regards the credit unions as somehow amateurish because they are voluntary and non-paid.  All credit unions have gone through the rigours in recent months.  Some of them have spent hundreds of thousands of euro from members' money on consultancy fees to meet the needs and requirements of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  They are not seeing light at the end of the tunnel.  They need to see that happening.  That is why I am asking about clearly defined timelines for the full implementation of the CUAC recommendations.  We are depending on the Department of Finance as a stakeholder in that process.  If we do not see progress in this respect within clearly defined timelines, that will not bode well for our confidence in the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.

I acknowledge the statement made by the Central Bank as the regulator to the effect that it is open to reviewing tiered regulation.  The Department's position is <i>ad idem<\/i>with that.  The implementation group is examining tiered regulation.  It has been established for a one-year period, but that can be extended if needs be.  As I mentioned earlier, we expect the implementation group to report on a modular basis.  As Ms Aherne has explained, the first topic the group is looking at is the section 35 lending restrictions.  The group will then quickly move on to examine the issue of tiered regulation.  I expect it to report on that issue in the coming months.  We are moving as quickly as we can.  This is a complex area.  Those who are regulated would always like the regulations to be changed more quickly than the regulator typically wants to move.  That is a fact in all regulated industries.

The credit unions do not know who to look to for support and help.  That is how I would characterise what happened here yesterday.  Mr. Carville's contribution this morning does not address any of those issues in a way that would give comfort to the credit unions that the Department understands them and what they are trying to achieve and the need for speed in respect of that.  Yesterday, they spoke to us about tiered regulation.  They are concerned about it.  They say it was a key deliverable of the commission report and they are waiting for it.  They said that consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged.  Consultation was expected to be meaningful with clear impact analysis forming the basis of significant changes, where consultation has been triggered, sectoral views have often been ignored as was the case with CP88.  They add that a one size fits all approach, a regulatory directive, can have significant adverse impacts, short and long term on a credit union.  These are just some of the comments being made.  In the main Mr. Carville will see that they express frustration.  If they are frustrated their members must be deeply frustrated by not being able to access, borrow or deposit money, talk to the credit union about the needs of their communities, mortgages or whatever else.<\/p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Brian McCrory, president of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, appealed for help.  He appeared before this committee and appealed to members to help the ILCU because nobody is listening to them.  He said they are going around in circles.  He told us they have &euro;11.5 billion in the banks which he wants to put to good use.  Housing was the example given.  The ILCU has spoken to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, who is keenly interested in its proposal.  It was suggested the Minister asked the ILCU to help and asked for its proposal.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is in discussion with the Department of Finance but nothing has been resolved.  Mr. McCrory was asked what has been achieved.

They are being charged by the banks to mind their money and equally they have solvency and other ratios in terms of reserves with which they have to comply.  People want to put their money in credit unions because they appear to members of the public to have a much less tarnished reputation following the past ten years than other parts of the financial services sector.  People are comfortable putting their money on deposit in the credit unions and in the post office, albeit not getting a great return, but they would not be getting a great return on their savings in a deposit account in the pillar banks or probably anywhere else.  It has got to a stage where credit unions are more or less putting a restriction on the taking in of deposits, be it a total amount of money on deposit or a particular amount per month.  It is a perverse and unusual relationship for a deposit taker to no longer want a customer's money.  Would Mr. Carville recommend changing legislation to allow the credit unions to invest in other areas, albeit not in very risky investment but in slightly less risk-free investments than they have made up to now?

I tried to tease out with them if they consider it to constitute excessive regulation.  I did not get an answer from them that it was excessive but they said it was very costly and burdensome.  Does the Department take the view that this level of regulation is appropriate, albeit costly, or is it excessive?  We talked about tiered regulation and that it might come in at some point in time and, obviously, ReBo, the Credit Union Restructuring Board, has engaged in considerable consultation on this but there will not be much consultation on it as that board is being wound down by the end of this month.  Can anything be done particularly for the smaller credit unions to make the regulation less costly for them to do what they have to do, as opposed to not doing what they are required to do?  Some credit unions have breached the regulations.  We asked the representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions about that on Tuesday and they said they do not condone any breach of the regulations.  Mr. Carville might outline some examples of where there were breaches of regulations and where the Department would take a view that there is a problem.

We do not have any particular insight or knowledge of the specific cases over and above what we read in the media reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1792,"content":"<p>I have a couple of further points.

The Credit Union Advisory Committee's report highlighted that the sectors concerned need to be taken on board and that serious engagement needs to take place.  What engagement has the Department with the bodies?  Prior to the current engagement of the implementation group, was there much engagement?  The credit unions, rather than me, are making the point, which I am just passing on, that they just do not have the engagement.  We asked them on Tuesday for points to be put to the Department.

Over the past quarter, we have had three CUAC meetings and two tripartite meetings, which involve the Central Bank, ReBo and the Department of Finance.  We have met the Central Bank separately twice and we have been talking to advisers who advise credit unions on their investment activities.  We are trying to understand directly from advisers who advise credit unions exactly what the issues are regarding the investment restrictions.  We have had three meetings on this since the start of the year.  We have met CUDA four times.  ILCU we have met twice.  We have attended CUMA-CUDA conferences.  My colleagues and I will be attending the ILCU conference next month in Citywest Hotel.  Those are the headline items I would flag.

Mr. Carville heard what the representatives were saying because he was watching the footage of the meeting.  There is a palpable sense of frustration.  The credit unions feel they have all this money, doing all this work, much of it on a voluntary basis, and going nowhere.  They said to us there would need to be a radical change in the mindsets of the people who regulate and govern.  We can talk about the regulator next but ultimately the regulator is bound by legislation that comes from the Minister, Department and these Houses.  If the credit unions are not going to be allowed to do things, they should be told, and if they are allowed do things, they should be allowed get on with it subject to normal oversight.  It is frustrating for all of us to hear from them what they are saying.  The Department is saying it is getting on with the credit unions and dealing with them on a day-to-day basis.  Maybe it is the entity they feel they have difficulty with as opposed to the arrangement dealing with the operations on a day-to-day basis.<\/p> <p>  All members share the frustration that was absolutely palpable in the room.

The target level of funding for the resolution fund was &euro;100 million and it was envisaged that the credit institutions would contribute &euro;25 million per annum for four years until the &euro;100 million target was achieved.  The credit unions' portion of the &euro;25 million annual contribution was set at &euro;7 million per annum.  However, the credit union movement has now contributed its portion of the &euro;25 million, that is, &euro;7 million per annum for five years, rather than the expected four years.

As members know, our statutory mandate is to ensure the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and to maintain the financial stability and well-being of the sector generally.  I start by acknowledging the very important role credit unions play in Irish society and the financial system and the strong voluntary and community ethos of the sector.  In my statement I will focus on three main areas - the current position of and main challenges facing the sector; the standards the Central Bank requires of credit unions in order that members&rsquo; funds are protected; and the need for transformation in the sector, drawing on priorities raised in the credit union advisory committee's review of 2016.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the profile of and challenges facing the sector, in the past decade credit unions have dealt with the effects of the financial crisis, increased competition, major business model challenges, significant restructuring and increased regulation.  From 428 credit unions a decade ago, there are 281 active today and a further 27 mergers in progress.  The sector has assets of &euro;16.1 billion.  The unprecedented level of restructuring was made possible by a huge effort across the sector to safely conduct so many transfers, while ensuring a continuation of services and the safety of members&rsquo; funds.  We thank the sector for its involvement in that process.  As a result, it has changed significantly.  There are now more large and fewer small credit unions, although levels of resilience vary widely across the sector.  At the registry we have prioritised regulation and supervisory changes to improve credit union safety and better position the sector for the future.  Some of the decisions we have taken include strengthening the regulatory framework, as recommended by the commission on credit unions in 2012; restrictions on lending to contain losses and their later removal, where appropriate; broader on-site engagement with credit unions; restructuring to support the needed transformation; and resolution of the weakest credit unions, all without loss of members&rsquo; funds.<\/p> <p>  The combined effect of these measures and appropriate actions by many credit unions over a number of years has better placed the sector to deal with its challenges.   However, significant challenges remain.  The biggest challenge is how to grow lending responsibly, following falls of over 40% in both loan income and volume in the last decade.  Net lending is still only marginally recovering, even after seven years of decline.  This core lending weakness reflects market factors such as prolonged de-leveraging by households and small businesses; increased competitiveness in the short-term unsecured lending market, where credit unions tend to predominate; and some credit union-specific structural factors such as an ageing and, therefore, more likely saving membership base and difficulties in changing business offerings to attract younger borrowers, which often require investment.  The investment income of credit unions helped to offset some of the decline in loan income for a number of years, but it is also now falling in the low yield environment.  Cost-to-income ratios are increasing.  All of these factors, taken together, put pressure on the long-term viability of credit unions.  This highlights the urgent need to address the business model challenges the sector faces. <\/p> <p>  On our required standards, our on-site engagement with credit unions is prioritised by risk and impact, or size, and we adopt a proportionate approach.  It is aimed at deriving the benefits of tiered regulation within our existing framework.  We have higher standards for larger and more complex entities and simpler expectations for smaller and simpler models of credit union.  We have a minimum standard for all, which is to ensure the safety of members&rsquo; funds.  We also use a differentiated application of common regulatory rules as another way to achieve the benefits of tiering, while accommodating the changing shape of the sector coming from restructuring.  Regrettably, standards of regulatory compliance are still well below those required to credibly safeguard members&rsquo; funds and position credit unions to tackle business model development.  We are still seeing an unacceptable number of credit unions failing to display a strategic understanding and good governance.  In several cases we have encountered limited financial skill sets and weak management, poor systems of control, weak risk, compliance and internal audit functioning and weaknesses in credit practices.  For example, we encountered several cases of problems in meeting the most basic financial requirements, including bank reconciliations.  It is the responsibility of credit union boards of directors to ensure appropriate control, direction and management of credit unions and to ensure risks are identified, monitored and mitigated.  We have communicated our expectations and findings to the sector, including that credit unions must meet regulatory requirements for their current business before embarking on riskier ventures.  We have also demonstrated and will continue to do so our willingness to take serious actions, including enforcement, restructuring and liquidation, to ensure credit unions adequately safeguard their members&rsquo; funds. <\/p> <p>  The third major issue is the need for transformation.  Our view is of a thriving credit union sector that is financially strong, that provides choice and for inclusion in the financial system and that carries out its important community role, while meeting regulatory requirements.  To get from where the sector is now to where it needs to be requires four main changes: a drive for younger active borrowers to increase core lending; deriving benefits from restructuring; developing the business model in a multi-step, risk-managed way; and increasing sectoral leadership and co-operation on shared services.<\/p> <p>  The drive to attract and retain active borrowers is critical to the sector&rsquo;s future.  We have urged the sector to consider how it can leverage its community advantages and trusted brand to attract a new generation of borrowing members, while pricing appropriately for risks and services and meeting regulatory requirements.  Some credit unions have used low cost but effective member profiling and targeted marketing to attract members which, together, are an important starting point.<\/p><p> On business model development, it is the responsibility of the sector to set out its vision and plans.  Our responsibility is to challenge them for risk, affordability, relevance and possible regulatory change.  We are concerned at the absence of a coherent future path supported by appropriate proposals, as well as at the length of time it takes for proposals to develop and mature and this is an area where we have called repeatedly for more sectoral leadership and clarity.<\/p><p> There has been some criticism that the Central Bank holds back development of the sector, especially with respect to long-term lending.  We would disagree with that.  First, the reality is we have not received any specific applications or proposals for long-term lending that are sufficiently well structured and have clear, sustainable aims.  We engage extensively with the sector in many different fora to better understand long term lending aims and to ensure that any evolving proposals address reasonable issues such as the investment costs, the projected impact on return on assets over time, shared services arrangements for costs and capabilities, changed funding arrangements that will be needed for the balance sheet risks, how to manage collateral and legal aspects and to meet evolving regulations, both domestic and international, that consumer mortgages require.<\/p><p> As we indicated in the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, review, we are willing to consider amending the long-term lending limits but we require clarity on credit unions&rsquo; plans for prudently developing longer-term lending and addressing the issues I have mentioned above.  Given the sector&rsquo;s current capabilities, any increase in mortgage lending would likely require changes on funding maturity to deal with balance sheet risks and be restricted to the more capable and financially-sound credit unions before being extending further.  Again, there is need for greater sectoral leadership in vision and clarity and a fuller understanding of risks involved to develop the roadmap of business model development.<\/p><p> For our part, the registry has provided guidance and analysis, through both the stakeholder dialogue forum and bilateral engagements.  We covered the potential impacts of long-term lending changes.  We have also undertaken to publish, within coming months, enhanced guidance on what we expect to see in long-term lending proposals.<\/p><p> In addition, we have taken a range of measures to support the sector&rsquo;s efforts including, in 2016, the establishment of a new business model development unit, which is headed up by deputy registrar, Frank Brosnan.  That is to drive forward better-developed proposals.  We also approve suitable proposals - we approved members&rsquo; payment current account services - and we are also developing a package of guidance on our expectations in a range of areas.  These measures will, we believe, be particularly beneficial for smaller credit unions, for whom it is more costly and difficult to tackle the many issues involved.<\/p><p> Overall, it is worrying that sectoral engagement on changing lending limits appears to have polarised to mortgages, rather than on a diverse lending portfolio.  We have not yet seen any investigations of other short and medium-term lending proposals that would build on the existing capabilities and balance sheet management of the sector.<\/p><p> There is important additional proposed business model development in the area of funding for social housing.  As we have indicated publicly previously, we will shortly consult with the sector regarding changes to investment regulations to accommodate investments in social housing and other investment classes subject to term limits.<\/p><p> Regarding CUAC&rsquo;s 2016 review, we welcomed the establishment of and participated in the group and we look forward to contributing to the implementation group, where we are represented.  Our submission to the review highlighted our view on major issues including tiered regulation and long-term lending, as I referred to earlier, and on common bond considerations.  Regarding the CUAC recommendation on consultation and engagement, we welcome the focus on enhanced engagement between the registry and the sector.  That is already a central part of our business model support role that I covered earlier.<\/p><p> Overall, it has been a challenging period for credit unions, and I want to acknowledge the constructive engagement of individual credit unions, representative bodies and other stakeholders, as we work to improve the sector&rsquo;s current and future state.  The most important challenges are to meet current regulatory requirements &ndash; which are there to safeguard members&rsquo; funds - and to drive forward clear development plans while retaining the sector&rsquo;s important voluntary ethos and community spirit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1898,"content":"<p>I welcome the registrar and her staff here today.

These limits allow credit unions to lend potentially up to 15% of their loan book beyond ten years and up to 40% of the loan book for between five and ten years.  What we found was that a very small number of credit unions use the available headroom relating to the existing limits.  Even though they could lend up to 15% of the loan book for beyond ten years, current usage is just over 2%.  If credit unions were to use the available headroom, we estimate it could give rise to an additional &euro;500 million in lending beyond ten years to reach the current allowable limit of 15%.  A very important point to note is while 11 credit unions have applied to us for discretion to apply the higher limit of 15% in long-term lending, only three of them use it.  This suggests many credit unions are already adapting their risk appetite.  Long-term lending, in particular mortgages, is a more complex business to get into and they are considering to a greater degree whether they are willing to do so.  We have not received a structured proposal from the sector for a new higher limit than that currently in place and on how the sector would adapt its current business models to meet such a higher limit.  We have engaged extensively with the sector regarding the issues that would need to be addressed in any proposal and we give guidance on this.  We will shortly publish additional guidance in this area.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our view on greater long-term lending in mortgages, it is quite a different business to that in which credit unions specialise and it tends to be a more complex business model.  Therefore, we certainly have highlighted to the sector that there is a need to greatly understand the impact on its business of the changes, for example, with regard to the its intentions regarding loan durations, the impact on credit unions' balance sheets, particularly in the context of funding, and how credit unions would deal with the additional capabilities required in this business, which has legal and collateral aspects.  The mortgage market tends to be a high volume low margin business with experienced players.  How would the credit unions propose to deal with these market environment issues?  It is an area where shared services or collaboration on services would help to reduce costs for individual credit unions getting into it, so sector-wide solutions on shared services would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the capability to do a significant amount of mortgage lending or long-term lending is quite different and it is not just related to larger asset size.  We have made that it clear that if the sector wishes to make a proposal in this area we have given it a good grounding on our expectations as to what such proposals would need to address, and we are open to changes in limits when we see where the sector wishes to take it forward.  Given all the complexities involved, we favour doing this in a multi-step and appropriately risk-managed way, because we want to ensure it does not unduly endanger members' funds or the financial security of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1912,"content":"<p>In her opening comments Ms McKiernan stated:<\/p><blockquote>Regrettably, standards of regulatory compliance are still well below those required to credibly safeguard members&rsquo; funds and to position credit unions to tackle business model development.

As I said in my statement, the majority of credit unions undertook appropriately conservative actions in response to the financial crisis to position them better to deal with the challenges ahead.  Some of the actions they took include increased provisioning, reduced dividends, building up reserves, and adapting to our regulatory requirements which are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the Irish credit union sector.  In doing this, they increased their resilience.  There was also a range of matters overseen by the Central Bank and others.  For example, we imposed a series of lending restrictions at the height of the crisis, the purpose of which was to contain excess losses.  In 2015 and 2016 we undertook a programme to remove these restrictions where it was appropriate to do so.  This helped to underpin the amount of losses that could potentially be taken.<\/p> <p>  There has been significant restructuring throughout the sector.  Much of it has been voluntary and reflects the success of the restructuring board in working directly with the credit unions to ensure successful mergers.  We welcome that so many of these were successfully undertaken and no members have lost any funds.  There has also been a series of resolution or involuntary restructures undertaken, which have had the purpose of removing the most serious failings in the sector.  Of these, five were resolution cases under legislation, directed transfers and two liquidations.  We also had a series of resolutions without the usual legislation and court process where we drew on the funds of the saving protection scheme of the Irish League of Credit Unions and saved taxpayers' money to the extent of &euro;25.5 million while ensuring those entities were safely merged with other more financially resilient credit unions.  The fact there has not been a major bailout cost for the sector reflects significant actions by the sector itself and a number of authorities.

Credit unions are treated differently from banks because their capital requirements are based on total funds rather than being risk-weighted.<\/p> <p>  The 10% reserve they require to back up their deposits is different from the way that banks are treated.  What is Ms McKiernan's take on that?  Does she regard that as necessary or important?  It seems that they find it very difficult.

We want to see it thrive and continue to be an important part of our financial system going forward.  We do that within the context of my statutory remit, which is to ensure the protection by credit unions of their members' funds, and also the financial stability of the sector more broadly.  We orient all of our supervisory and regulatory activities around working towards having the sector be financially viable in the future.<\/p> <p>  I will address the 10% reserve ratio and how that came about.  It is generally considered to be a minimum capital adequacy ratio as recommended by the World Council of Credit Unions.  That World Council of Credit Unions also advocates that, for credit union sectors that might consider moving to a risk-weighted approach for the capital ratio, it should really only apply where credit unions are competing directly with banks that adopt the Basel III rules and where they and their supervisors thoroughly understand how to calculate capital under pillar 1 of the Basel III rules.  We are not in anything like that kind of credit union sector and because of the generally homogeneous and less complex business model of Irish credit unions, we believe that a non-risk-weighted approach is fully reasonable in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The 10% ratio was introduced in 2009 and there was an opportunity for consultation on that.  Significant support came from sector respondents at the time for the concept of maintaining strong reserves.  There were some concerns on implementation timelines etc., but overall, moving to having a strong financial resilience layer like that was supported.  It is a loss-absorbing layer.  It is there to give credit unions a backstop to ensure that they are still able to protect  their members' funds.  We should always come back to what its purpose is and make sure that it can do that.  My view is that it remains appropriate for the sector and that we would want to see reasonable financial resilience in a sector which is contemplating taking on riskier forms of business model and development into the future.  The majority of credit unions are well above that level.  The average across the sector is currently 16%.  Credit unions themselves recognise that they need to have a strong loss-absorbing layer for both their current activities and prospective future ones.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, credit unions with assets over &pound;10 million sterling must also hold capital of 10% or greater.  They have a situation where they can use a buffer of potentially 2%.  In other words, they can eat into the 10% as long as they go back up towards it again within a specific period of time.

I have a great understanding and a certain sympathy with the sector.  That is a big challenge.  I should point out that we are seeing a number of credit unions which have responded very well to that challenge.  In our public statements, we are often more likely pointing out what needs to be done among the weaker ones.  This is an opportunity to highlight where we are seeing good developments.  Both large and small credit unions have been able to work within the existing framework and environment to be financially and operationally strong.<\/p><p>Credit unions have been able to work within the existing framework and environment to be financially and operationally strong.  They are meeting all of our regulatory requirements generally and delivering a range of services to their communities, paying a dividend and being viable into the future.  As such, there is a great deal to build on there.  In fact, it is that sort of basis we want to see more of across the sector as the platform on which business model development should be built.<\/p><p> What are the factors in the success of those credit unions from which others can learn?  It tends to be strong governance and management, plus strong systems and controls which are needed to demonstrate protections as well as to actually protect members funds.  It is also a matter of pricing appropriately for risk.  We often see credit unions where the interest rate charged on loans is unusually low.  While that might be in line with the community and social objective, it may conflict with the financial objective of safeguarding the resilience of the credit union.  We are also seeing some proactive if low-key work by a number of credit unions large and small on how to turn their members from savers to borrowers or how to attract members from a younger demographic which is likely to borrow.  As I said in my statement, that includes more proactive demographic profiling, social media campaigns, promotion and marketing.  I refer to these issues because they are lower cost for credit unions to undertake and they are a reasonable starting point from which to tackle the issue of growing a loan book while developing broader and potentially much more risky or different capability based business models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>For most people to borrow they must have saved in the first place.  To save means putting in deposits but to do that brings us back to the issue we are in.  Part of that is the investment capability in terms of what the credit unions are allowed to invest in, which is quite restricted.  I am sure there are reasons it is as restrictive as it is.  On Tuesday, we got issues on the very strict liquidity requirements and the very restrictive class of investments.  It means they do not have anywhere for these deposits to go.  Is there scope in terms of where they can invest these deposits in the shorter term at least?  It is a chicken-and-egg situation if one cannot bring people in to make a deposit.  One is usually not going to lend to people before they have established a track record of savings and can see that these are people who are able to put away money so that they can borrow and then repay the borrowing.  Ms McKiernan alluded to the fact the profile is getting older and people's mortgages and outgoings are getting smaller as their incomes improve.  As such, they are saving.  However, credit unions are trying to attract people to come in.  If they have surplus funds, they are not able to give them to the credit unions because they are already in the situation where they have too much cash.  Where do we go in terms of the investments?

As I said in other fora before that and in bilateral contacts with the central bodies who were here on Tuesday as well as with individual credit unions and other stakeholders, we have made it clear that one of the issues we would like to see addressed most proactively is the need for more of what I have called \"sectoral leadership\".  By that I mean clarity from the sector regarding the vision for the business model moving forward.  That is not necessarily from any one individual or body but it is for the sector to more clearly set out what it believes is the best way to take the model forward.  We have also made clear our expectations.  In each of the areas which is on the table for discussion right now, including long-term lending and mortgages, I have set out our reservations, expectations and a stance of openness to change albeit we need to see how it is going to be used.  Other areas relate to social housing, which I will come back to in a minute.  There are issues in relation to payments, current accounts and debit cards also.  Clarity of direction and in proposals and faster action on proposals are required.<\/p> <p>  It might be illustrative to take an example.  We received what I would describe as an \"emergent proposal\" which I will not name for reasons of confidentiality, and had constructive engagement on it in early 2014.  We set out our views and what needed to be addressed to take it forward.  We were delivering on our expectations and guidance and engaging proactively.  That would have taken the form of many bilateral engagements as well as multilateral ones.  In 2017, it is still, however, at an early stage of development.  That is not in any way because we are blocking it or making anything it unclear.  It is actually because the issues to be dealt with are pretty complex.  Other matters may have got in the way or become higher priorities for the particular owner of the proposals.  However, it is disingenuous to portray us as being blockers in any way in relation to that.  As such, the first thing I want from the sector is greater clarity of future vision and direction and the taking forward of proposals.<\/p> <p>  Let us point to areas of success on the business model.  One of them is in the area of current accounts which has become more complex due to evolving EU legislation, higher expectations, digitisation in financial technology, etc.  With extensive engagement last year, a group of progressively minded and developmental credit unions came together with a design and we worked extensively with them to turn that from the design phase to the application phase to the approval phase.  That became known as the members' payment current account service, or MPCAS.<\/p><p>We would point to that as the model we would like to see taken forward regarding other proposals.  It was very clear what they wished to do.  It was clear who were the owners of it.  They understood that shared services gave it the best chance of success and we engaged proactively to ensure it happened and published our application processes and risk management framework.  It is not to say that this is the only winning proposal, but to say that the way in which it was dealt with shows, for one, that we are open for business, two, that we will help the sector where the sector is clear on where it can help itself, and three, that these things can be done far quicker when there is effort behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#T01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>I will wrap up with a final couple of small points.  Does Ms McKiernan wish to refute any of the issues that were alluded to on Tuesday?  Does she wish to say that any of them were not correct and are not what her office wanted?<\/p> <p>  My final point, separate to that, is on an argument that was being put forward, which I was trying to tease out.  Nobody was saying that the regulation was excessive but some were complaining about its cost.  They were saying it was excessive without saying that it was excessive.  I know that there is an aspect of tiered regulation that can be developed over time.  Does the Registrar feel that the regulation currently in place is appropriate for all sizes of credit union or are excessive regulations being put on some of the smaller credit unions that will ultimately, over time, have to deal with it?  Proportionality is mentioned in her speech, but we certainly got the feeling on Tuesday that there were complaints about all this extra regulation, not so much that it was there, but that it was costly.  As we move forward, is that just the way it has to be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#U00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490261400,"counter":1940,"content":"<p>Can I address two points there?  One relates to the regulatory burden, either the cost or the practice of it.  On the second point, I will not attempt to refute all of the matters raised during a very long hearing on Tuesday but perhaps I will raise a few for clarification purposes.<\/p> <p>  On regulation and regulatory burden, we have one framework but we do not apply it with a one-size-fits-all approach.  We do so in a proportionate way.  We do that through several different approaches.  One is that we have higher expectations and requirements for the largest credit unions and those that aspire to do more complex business.  We have much simpler expectations and engagements with the smaller credit unions whose model remains simple.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our engagements with credit unions, we differentiate significantly on that basis too.  We have larger, longer and more frequent supervisory engagements with the biggest and most risky credit unions, as would be expected.  We have scaled-back and less frequent engagements with the smallest, lower risk, credit unions.  We focus significantly on viability and credit risk there.  We are operating within our existing framework in a tiered way to the greatest degree that we can.  We are trying to adhere to the spirit of the Commission on Credit Unions' recommendation in respect of tiering, but within one framework.  It would be erroneous for it to be presented as a one-size-fits-all framework.  It is not.  <\/p> <p>  We have also started to introduce an element of tiering in the way in which we apply certain rules.  For example, with regard to payment service and MPCAS approval, which means taking on a more complex and expensive future business line and which involves particular costs, we are, at least initially, making that opportunity only available to credit unions over &euro;75 million.  It can cascade down to smaller credit unions in time.  That is very much in the spirit of letting more complex business be taken forward by more progressive credit unions who are better able to handle any downside risks from it. That is in respect of the cost or burden of supervision and regulation.<\/p> <p>  One issue which I believe is important to get on the table arising from Tuesday is the sense that we are blocking the making available of sector-significant funds towards social housing.  That is absolutely not the case.  To be clear, one of the main reasons the large excess funds of the sector cannot be made available for social housing directly through lending is the common bond.  Under the common bond, credit unions can only lend to members within their common-bond area.  If a credit union wished to lend to approved housing bodies, unless the approved housing body was within the individual space, it could not do so.  They would not be able to marshal the funds at the level of the sector in that way.<\/p> <p>  While recognising that the common bond is a core part of the Irish sector, which is very valued and which the sector would not want to change or meddle with in any simple way, we nonetheless highlighted that it was an important issue in our submission to the CUAC review in 2016.  We pointed out situations where the common bond, in its current legislative framework, restricts certain progress, both on social housing and on restructuring.  We put it on the table as an important issue that could be addressed.  It is up to the credit union sector to decide how far it is willing to change that.  Progressive credit unions in other jurisdictions have tended to move away from the type of common bond approach we have now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":1941,"content":"<p>Is the Registrar saying that it is the sector's problem?

She indicated that the bank had a vision of a particular business model started in 2014 but which did not progress in 2017.  I am trying to gain an understanding of the culture within the bank's organisation; it is quite difficult to understand it.  She should correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that if I was to come to the bank with something I deem to be progressive for a credit union, it would state it would fly or it would not.  It is a case of \"Yes\" or \"No\".  Am I right in discerning that the bank will not come up with a business model or ideas for how something should progress?  What is the process involved?  Is it iterative or interactive?  Does the bank engage positively?  It seems that if an idea does not fly, that is it and a credit union must go back to the drawing board.  I want to understand the Central Bank's powers in developing new business models and how deep is the engagement.  How prescriptive is the bank it in developing new business models?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#U02600","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490261400,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>We are very clear that it is the role and responsibility of the sector to develop its business model proposals.

In respect of our interactions with the sector on Tuesday, there was consistency in its approach with no outliers.  CUMA, CUDA and ILCU were represented.  They would argue that they are showing leadership and that they are more than willing to engage.  The Chairman has used the merry-go-round analogy.  They have been on the merry-go-round with the Department of Finance and they contend with the Central Bank as well to show the type of leadership and develop the innovation and business models Ms McKiernan is speaking about here, but there still seems to be a resistance to that.  It would be my contention that by any objective analysis, they have shown leadership because they have gone through the rigours of restructuring and, with some outliers, have adhered to the restructuring process as regulated by the Registrar of Credit Unions.<\/p> <p>  To use Ms McKiernan's language, they now want to move into that multi-step of developing the sector again, growing the business model and encouraging new lending with a younger demographic of borrowers.  It seems that neither they nor Ms McKiernan are a million miles apart but there is something within the chasm and vacuum that needs to be unblocked.  I do not know if it is an issue of perception regarding how the Central Bank perceives the sector and how the sector perceives the Central Bank.  Somebody needs to do a bit of mediation because if I listen to Ms McKiernan and the intervention of the representative bodies, I can see that they all want to go in the same direction but there is some blockage in the way that needs to be worked through because they have already gone through the rigours of the regulatory process.<\/p> <p>  I know Ms McKiernan is not paying lip service to the idea of recognising the importance of the sector, but there is some responsibility on the part of the Central Bank to ensure the sector progresses back into productive lending sooner rather than later because this has been going on too long.  The Credit Union Advisory Committee report has been in existence for a while and the implementation group only met in the first quarter of this year so we need to see progress by the second or third quarter because we have already told the Department of Finance that we want it to appear again before this committee.

That will then be aligned with business model proposals, be they on long-term lending, mortgages or other matters, and taken to us.  That will address the sort of considerations we raise every day and which in our view are reasonable and to be expected.  In respect of mortgages and long-term lending, an argument that is regularly raised is that long-term lending limits are impeding credit unions from developing their lending again.  We would say there is significant available headroom, and I gave some of those figures earlier, and that represents an opportunity for credit unions, few or many, as decided according to their own risk appetite, to get into greater long-term lending and-or mortgages and understand all the risks and complexities in that process on which they can build.  That would be a reasonable approach.  Those limits have been in place for a period because it is recognised that this is a more complex business and that it will take time to build the capability and financial understanding to do that.  That is an important clarification.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relating to long-term lending is that we are very keen to hear from the sector about what it thinks would be some reasonable upper limit.  If the current upper limit is 15% over ten years, should it be 20%, 25% or 40%?  Those higher limits represent a vastly different type of business model to manage compared with credit unions that specialise in smaller-scale personal and small business unsecured lending.  Obviously, a roadmap of how to get to a different type and scale of transformed business model would need to be worked through.  With our mandate to protect members' funds, one would not expect and we would not intend to lift limits and see what happens.  We would prefer to and currently do engage extensively with the sector to understand its aims, what limits it feels are the appropriate future limits in the sector and how many credit unions are aligned behind that kind of aim.  Is it to be for a very small number or for a much larger number?  There are huge issues to deal with.  I fully accept that this is a complex area but we want to ensure that as it is taken forward, it is done in an appropriately risk managed way.

First, we have published a thematic review - we will shortly publish a second - of our findings in respect of two specific risk areas.  One relates to the application of governance requirements on fitness and probity.  The second relates to outsourcing.  The aim is to call out the types of failings as well as the good practice that we have seen.  We want to show the good examples for other credit unions to learn from as well as the types of standards we expect of well-managed financial institutions.  These institutions are managing other people's money.  This process is in line with our statutory mandate to protect members' funds and the stability of the sector.<\/p> <p>  I wish to point to one particular financial indicator.  It is symptomatic of the overall improved financial resilience of the sector &ndash; not to speak of other regulatory requirements.  There are now three credit unions that do not meet the 10% regulatory requirement.  Obviously, we work extensively with these to mitigate their issues because the 10% regulatory reserve ratio is the loss-absorbing layer and it is an important indicator of the financial resilience of a credit union.  The number is down from 52 in 2011, which was a time when crisis conditions were far worse.<\/p> <p>  We are able to give confidence to the vast majority of credit union members in this regard.  In respect of that financial indicator and others credit unions are in a vastly improved position than they were several years ago.  This reflects the significant efforts made within credit unions whereby the majority have taken conservative financial decisions to improve their financial positions as well as their attempts to adopt the regulatory framework.  In many cases, these attempts have been successful and in some further work remains to be done.

We look closely to see whether such failings exist in other credit unions and, where they do, we work to ensure they are remediated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":2001,"content":"<p>The point is the Central Bank will not quantify them in numbers.

We are told there is no tiered system, but Ms McKiernan is telling us that there is a tiered system.

That is their complaint.  Again, I am keen for Ms McKiernan to focus on the numbers that she is talking about in order that we might understand it.  As I said, he made these remarks in her speech.  I would like her to answer the point about too much regulation.  It is simply preventing the credit unions from doing business.  Moreover, she keeps referring to the need to safeguard funds.

However, we have higher requirements, as I have said before, for the larger credit unions and scaled-back requirements for smaller credit unions.

Arising from that engagement, we assess the credit unions under the key headings, whether that is credit risk, governance risk, strategic risk, business model risk, investment risk, etc.  We give a report card to the credit unions.  It is a very interactive and constructive engagement.  We are not there to find fault.  However, we do identify the risks and grade them in terms of their significance.  It is a very well articulated framework.  The credit unions understand it in advance of our going onsite.  Arising from this, we develop what is called a risk mitigation programme.  We show the risks we have identified.  A credit union might have so many red risks and so many amber risks.  Those are the ones they need to focus on.  We give them a suggested remediation that should be put in place to address these weaknesses.  We send that to the credit union in draft form.  Our expectation is that they either accept it, come back with contrary evidence if they have it, or they suggest an alternative remediation which achieves the same objective that may be more palatable or more feasible from their perspective.  That is the nature of our engagement.  It is evidence-based engagement.  Arising from that, we have an element of profile within the sector.  The remediations are time-bound.<\/p> <p>  As the registrar said, it is not fair to quote a number because some credit unions meet the remediation actions and address the weakness.  Therefore, that number shifts.  We know where there are risks.  If a heat map is done of the sector, we know areas in which weaknesses are emerging that are evidenced.  We can also see other potential areas where we are beginning to see weaknesses develop further.  We are calling those out.

Lending restrictions were initially imposed at the height of the crisis to stop excess dangerous lending and the potential for larger losses.  They largely achieved that aim.  They were calibrated as such that they did not impede the normal business and personal lending of credit unions.  In general, they were not biting, but they prevented excess.  They then stayed in place for quite a period of time and credit unions did not seek to have them removed.  However, we felt that it was important to better understand whether all credit unions should remain under a lending restriction or could meet the appropriate and proportionate requirements regarding their credit management.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, we started a significant review.  At the start, there were 197 lending restrictions in place.  There are now 62.  That is less that one third of what it was.  It demonstrates two things.  First, the credit unions that can meet the requirements, which are not onerous, can have a lending restriction review.  The Central Bank is proportionate and open to change with regard to any of its rules if credit unions can meet the required standards.  Second, the restrictions that remain in place do so because those credit unions have decided that either they would rather live under a restriction imposed externally than come up with their own rules and risk appetite and lending, or they have not been able to demonstrate that they can meet the basic requirements to show that they best safeguard members funds in the way they lend those funds.  Lending restrictions now carry an information content of where the credit union sits with regard to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#Y01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":2018,"content":"<p>I thank the speakers for their time.

It referred to situations in which credit unions were operating significantly like banks and applying the Basel approach, which would require the calculation of capital in the same way as it is done under the pillar 1 approach.  Credit unions in Ireland still have a less complex business model than one tends to find in other jurisdictions.  We believe that it still remains appropriate to have a flat rate 10% required reserve ratio in that light.  If the model is to change significantly, that can be revisited.

Something is clearly not right here and it must be said.  I am sure that all of what Ms McKiernan has just said would be accepted by the credit union movement as being what they want to hear.  Deputy McGrath went back to the &euro;1 billion figure.  That was around October 2011.  It was disgraceful and damaging to the credit union movement that this was stated as baldly as it was when in fact the hearings today and on Tuesday have established that &euro;25 million was paid from that fund.  Some &euro;25 million was also paid from the credit unions' own funds from within the credit union movement.  Then there was the &euro;4.3 million mentioned by Ms McKiernan this morning.  That brings it to a total of &euro;54 million.  By any measurement, the difference between &euro;1 billion and &euro;54 million is substantial.  I believe that whoever got this wrong needs to explain it.<\/p> <p>  We also have Ms McKiernan's speech from early March.  I believe the same point applies.  General statements like that are being made about credit unions and not enough information, context or explanation around the comments are being given.  I believe, quite frankly, that some of the comments were unwarranted.<\/p> <p>  At today's hearing, in comparison to what happened on Tuesday, Ms McKiernan said there is a proportionate or tiered approach to the credit unions, yet the Credit Union Managers' Association has said that tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered.  That is a pretty bald statement being made by those who are at the coalface.  It does not add up with regard to what is happening within the credit union movement that it would say one thing and the Department of Finance tells the committee that this area of decision-making belongs to the Central Bank.  According to the Department officials this morning, the Central Bank can introduce a three-tiered system if it wants.  Ms McKiernan referred to consultation and engagement and, again, the Credit Union Managers' Association told this committee that consultation and engagement has been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged.  Ms McKiernan has painted a different picture this morning.  If we look at the regulatory directives, the Credit Union Managers' Association told the committee that a one size fits all approach to regulatory directives can have very significant adverse impacts on the credit union sector, both in the short and long term.<\/p> <p>  On the housing issue, the credit union representatives met with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and they had conversations with the Minister for Finance.  The credit unions cannot get out of that merry-go-round to reach a point where they can deal directly with the registrar in the Central Bank or to the point where someone could introduce legislation on the common bond issue.  If the credit union representatives are telling us this, they either do not understand the matter and are being misled somewhere or their conversations are being parked and not acted upon.<\/p> <p>  They have asked that the development proposals of credit unions would be dealt with in a more structured, timely and appropriate manner.  They say that SI 1 of 2016, which the Minister has the capacity to develop, puts them at a significant disadvantage in relation to banks.  The credit union representatives are telling a completely different story from the story presented to this committee this morning by the Department of Finance, or indeed by the Central Bank as the regulator.  There is a breakdown somewhere and the people who are suffering from these negative and general comments are credit union members because they are wondering what is going on here.  There are others who suffer.  Let me return to the housing issue.  Some Members in the House feel that &euro;11.5 billion was put into the banks by credit unions, and credit unions have shown a willingness to participate in some saving mechanism for those looking for housing, but all of this is being frustrated by regulation, bureaucracy and a lack of legislation.<\/p> <p>  I am trying to sum up what has happened here.  I will leave here today confused about who is doing what to assist or not to assist the credit unions.  Ms McKiernan gives an account and sticks to that account - I am not saying she is wrong and the credit unions are right - but the accounts vary so considerably that it is difficult to understand what is needed to get out of what appears to be the mess we are in at present.  Simple measures were pointed out to us regarding regulation and the sanction for annual general meetings, for example.  There are significant delays and backlogs preventing AGMs from taking place.  This is what the credit union movement has told us under the headings of investment rules, changed rules around lending, regulatory reserve ratios and the attitude of the Central Bank in the context of the speech.  The credit union representatives told the committee that many of the issues arise from a lack of Oireachtas oversight.<\/p><p>The proposal today was that we would have regular oversight of whatever happened in the previous quarter and that we would try to bring focus to this.  That should not need to be the case.  Does Ms McKiernan want to comment on what I have said?  I know there is a lot in it.  I have to say I am deeply unhappy about the exchanges we have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#BB00500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490261400,"counter":2101,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to respond.  I would like to pick up on three points.  I imagine that in every regulated sector, there is healthy tension and disagreement in the relationship between the regulator and those who are being regulated about how to take matters forward.  We are absolutely clear that we want the same outcome as the sector and its representative bodies.  I will not repeat myself by saying we want to see and support a thriving credit union sector that continues to provide valuable services to members in communities and across the financial system.  We may differ in how we should get there.  The picture we have gives us the advantage of seeing sector-wide practices and levels of regulatory compliance.  We have called out the successes we have seen.  However, we also have to call out the areas where further work needs to be done to best protect members' funds.  Any business model proposals that are ambitious or otherwise should be built on solid foundations and should meet the requirements that apply to the current business approach, which is much less complex.<\/p> <p>  I know tiered regulation has been a central issue here.  When we consulted the sector in 2014 on a form of tiering, it did not agree on a form to take forward at that stage.  There were differences between the views of small and large credit unions.  In our proposed model, we advocated that the smaller credit unions should be able to do more than those in the lowest category set out by the Commission on Credit Unions - type 1 - are currently able to do.  Even though we expanded the range of services and opportunities available to credit unions in that category, the response from the sector at that stage was that smaller credit unions did not wish to be so confined.  When we looked at this retrospectively, we found that if the form of tiering outlined in an example by the Commission on Credit Unions had been adopted, there would now be 30 credit unions in the type 1 system.  One third of the credit unions in question are now in a transfer process.  We would have built a system that would have eventually covered a very small proportion of the sector and we would have constrained it in what it could do.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is probably just as well that we did not push ahead with the implementation of that kind of framework because it would eventually have become somewhat irrelevant.  As we have said previously, we are not against any form of tiered regulation.  We have sought to achieve the benefits of tiering within our existing framework.  We do not assume that one size fits all.  We have proportionality in our approach.  We are very happy for anyone in the sector to challenge us on how alternative models could drive out more benefits than those we feel we can deliver within our approach.<\/p> <p>  As a result of our focused attention on reducing the number of outstanding AGMs, just 12 organisations in this sector, ten of which are currently in a transfer process, have outstanding AGMs at present.  We are very keen to ensure AGMs happen as scheduled because they give members an opportunity to get the information they require to understand the strategic direction and financial position of their credit unions.  Credit unions sometimes cannot hold AGMs because their financial accounts are not finalised due to factors within the credit union.  I referred earlier to failings in basic financial management, including bank reconciliation.  Such practices in a credit union will hold up the finalisation of its financial accounts.  We sometimes require supervisory matters to be remediated.  Due diligence in relation to a transfer of engagement sometimes needs to be finalised.  I acknowledge that such matters can cause delays.  The number of outstanding AGMs is significantly smaller than the numbers that were noted when practices in the sector were different in previous years.  For example, 35 AGMs were outstanding at the beginning of 2015 and 29 AGMs were outstanding at the beginning of 2016.  As I have said, just 12 AGMs are outstanding now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie McKiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":2102,"content":"<p>I will respond to Ms McKiernan after Senator Burke asks some more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#CC00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1490261400,"counter":2103,"content":"<p>Have any members' funds been lost over the years since the crash?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017032300002#CC00400","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490261400,"counter":2104,"content":"<p>No member has lost any funds in all the restructuring and resolution actions that have been undertaken.

Before we get to the main item of business, I take a quick moment to think of our many colleagues and friends at Westminster following yesterday's awful attacks.  We have had a great deal of discussion in recent weeks with our colleagues in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords and all of our thoughts are with them and, in particular, the security staff and police forces both in the United Kingdom and here, the role of which in protecting democracy we sometimes take for granted.<\/p><p>Apologies have been received from Senators Frances Black, Michael McDowell and Michelle Mulherin.  Apologies have also been received from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile who will not have a substitute as the entire Sinn F&eacute;in Seanad delegation are in Derry.  We send our sympathy to them.  <\/p><p>I remind all members and visitors to ensure mobile phones are switched off or set to airplane mode.  Leaving them in silent mode will not work to prevent interference with the microphones.<\/p><p>I welcome members and, on their behalf, the officials who join us from the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, and his colleagues, Mr. James Martin and Mr. William O'Dwyer.  <\/p><p>The meeting marks the beginning of a new, substantive piece of work for the Seanad.  Since the referendum in the United Kingdom last June, there have been a number of debates.  I note that several members are involved in very good technical work on each of the areas to be covered.  This Seanad special select committee will add an important and different element to the work of the Oireachtas, building on the work that has already been done.  In considering a number of important issues together the committee should have the capacity to bring a constructive, an holistic and a considered approach to bear.  It is determined to focus on the most significant challenges identified, the solutions stakeholders and others are exploring and developments to address these challenges and the implementation of solutions.  The committee was formed only recently and is determined to begin to engage quickly.  As such, this session marks the beginning of its important contribution which will remain solution-focused and practical.<\/p><p>There are a number of substantial areas which the committee will cover but one which deserves early attention is the common travel area.  This is an area of policy and a way of living, from which almost all of us have benefited in travelling to the United Kingdom.  Those living in Border areas sometimes benefit from it on a daily basis.  The easy movement of people across the Border has become essential to everyday life.  As such, I am delighted to welcome the Secretary General and his colleagues.  Senators are interested in the Department's work in preparation for negotiations and to safeguard the common travel area.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am accompanied by Mr. Jimmy Martin, assistant secretary, whose responsibilities include the Department&rsquo;s Brexit unit, and Mr. Willie O&rsquo;Dwyer, principal officer in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of the Department who looks at the issue of border control.<\/p> <p>  The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union presents unprecedented challenges for Irish society and we can all agree that how we respond will shape our future for decades to come.  Preparations are being led strongly from the centre through the Cabinet committee on Brexit which is chaired by the Taoiseach and of which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality is a member.  An interdepartmental group of senior officials, on which the Department of Justice and Equality is represented, reports to the Cabinet committee and takes forward the detailed co-ordination of analysis and preparations for the United Kingdom's exit.  In turn, all Departments have structures in place to deal with issues of relevance to their policy areas.  We are all active in consulting, engaging and preparing for the forthcoming negotiations and managing the impact of the United Kingdom's exit.  This work has been aided greatly by the all-island civic dialogue process, as well as by public and stakeholder engagement.<\/p> <p>  The common travel area has been identified by the Government as one of the four priority issues for Ireland, with the economy, Northern Ireland and the future of the European Union.  Given the Department of Justice and Equality's responsibilities in immigration and border control matters, we have naturally been centrally involved in the analysis and management of this aspect of Ireland's preparations.  We are working closely with other relevant Departments, including our colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in the context of the overall strategic approach to the forthcoming negotiations.  The Government is unequivocally committed to maintaining the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  These arrangements have been in place since the foundation of the State and are an important feature of the close relationship between the two jurisdictions.  Our entitlement to stay outside the Schengen arrangements and maintain the common travel area is recognised in Protocols 19 and 20 of the EU treaties.  These arrangements are in place alongside and complement the special position of Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement on the citizenship rights of the people of Northern Ireland.  The daily reality of the operation of the commons travel area is one of deep and extensive interaction between the two jurisdictions, as the Chairman noted.<\/p><p> I will demonstrate the importance of the common travel area to the social ties and economic lifeblood of our respective jurisdictions.  Of the 27.9 million passenger journeys through Dublin Airport in 2016, 9.9 million were from the UK to Ireland or from Ireland to the UK, which is 36% of the total.  Averaged out over the year, it means 27,000 passengers have their journey facilitated by the common travel area every day.  In 2015, 1.2 million residents of Northern Ireland used Dublin Airport, which averaged almost 25,000 people per week crossing the Border to catch flights, and 1 million visitors to Northern Ireland came into this State via Dublin Airport.  All of these journeys, and the economic activity generated, are made possible by the common travel area arrangements so much so that it is taken for granted in facilitating movement of people North-South and east-west.  The picture at other entry points to the State is the same.  Cork Airport has over a dozen routes to the UK, with almost 1 million passengers, or 50% of the total, in 2016 taking a journey in either direction.  The number of passenger journeys by sea through our ferry ports is also significant at approximately 2.8 million per year.  It is estimated there are an average of 2.2 million monthly vehicular crossings on the North-South land Border.  These vital statistics relate to the movement of people.  We should not forget that in addition to people moving freely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the common travel area is also about allowing people to remain, work, access services and to be educated and so forth in either jurisdiction.  Preserving those provisions in addition to travel rights is at the heart of maintaining the common travel area.  <\/p><p> Prior to the UK vote on Brexit, the operation of the common travel area continued in the background of most people&rsquo;s lives without a great deal of active consideration.  Many of the entitlements it confers had become intermingled with rights derived from EU law on free movement.  When this body of law ceases to apply insofar as the UK is concerned, the pre-existing relationship between Ireland and the UK will come to the fore.  In order to outline the scope and nature of the CTA arrangements, it will be helpful for me to outline the approach we took in the Department to studying this issue, which is to go back through its history.<\/p><p> We can trace the origin of the common travel area to the history of the two countries as a common jurisdiction with a shared citizenship following the Act of Union.  After Irish Independence, and up until 1948, as far as the UK was concerned, Ireland remained part of the Commonwealth and Irish citizens remained subjects of the British monarch with the same entitlements as British subjects.  In that context it made little sense to impose passport controls.  While the attitude of the Irish authorities was different in political terms, from the earliest days of the State the Irish Government wished to maintain the common travel area.  British nationals were not treated as aliens in Irish law and for most matters were treated the same as Irish nationals.  The word \"alien\" is an immigration word in ancient legislation.  Even after Ireland left the Commonwealth, special provision was made in the Ireland Act 1949 which provided that Irish nationals were treated as non-foreign in UK law.  On the Irish side, S.I. No. 1\/1949 was made to the effect that UK nationals would enjoy similar rights and privileges to Irish nationals in the UK.  These fundamental characteristics of the relationship have remained applicable to this date as a result of various reforms of UK immigration law in the 1970s and 1980s and by both countries becoming members of the then European Economic Community in 1973.<\/p><p> In practice, the most immediately concrete expression of the common travel area relates to the operation of border controls and the freedom of Irish and UK nationals to travel passport-free between the two jurisdictions.  These arrangements have been in place since Irish Independence, with the only period of interruption arising during and immediately after the Second World War.  The common travel area operates to some degree like a mini Schengen zone, with the immigration authorities in both jurisdictions co-operating to protect the borders of the CTA and to prevent its abuse.  Central to the operation of the common travel area is that each State enforces the other&rsquo;s conditions of landing for non-EU nationals.  I stress that it refers to non-EU nationals.  This is a crucial point in the context of the forthcoming UK exit negotiations.  <\/p><p> This co-operation has deepened in recent years under the aegis of the Common Travel Area Forum, which is an official body from both jurisdictions that meets on a regular basis.  The information sharing systems we have put in place have made it possible to introduce the British-Irish visa scheme and the Irish short stay visa waiver programme, both of which make it easier for visa required nationals to visit both jurisdictions, with considerable benefits in terms of tourism and business travel.  Tourism Ireland projects there will be 50,000 Chinese visitors to Ireland this year.  The British-Irish scheme will enable all of these visitors to move between our two countries.  In 2012 before it was introduced, that number was only 17,000.  Our objective is to continue to operate these arrangements and to continue to co-operate closely with the UK.  It is also important to emphasise that Ireland remains a committed member of the European Union and will operate these arrangements in a way that is compatible with EU law.  In particular, we will continue to uphold the right of free movement of all citizens after the UK leaves the union.<\/p><p> The common travel area border control arrangements are complemented by a range of broadly reciprocal entitlements in terms of rights to reside, work and access services.  These entitlements are closely associated with the freedom of movement between the two jurisdictions and have their roots in the historic associations and legal provisions I have outlined.  While the policy responsibility for many of these areas rests with other Departments, we have been working closely with them in the analysis of this issue.  All of this work is inputting into Ireland&rsquo;s preparation for the forthcoming negotiations.<\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure current CTA arrangements continue following the expected withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Pending the Article 50 process commencing, an extensive programme of engagement has been put in place to support this strategic objective.  The importance of the common travel area has been highlighted through political and diplomatic engagement with other member states and the EU institutions.  Considerable efforts are being made to build awareness and understanding of its significance, including in the context of North-South relations and the peace process.  Members will also have seen the very clear commitments from the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May to maintain its benefits into the future.  There are many aspects of the forthcoming negotiations on which it would not be helpful for me to speculate.  However, I assure the committee that our preparations have been extensive and we will play our part alongside other Government Departments to ensure the best possible outcome for the Irish people.  <\/p><p> I look forward to discussion with the committee and my colleagues over the next number of hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Waters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490266800,"counter":2148,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Waters for that detailed intervention.

It is a very important committee because Brexit is an issue for many people.  In the part of Ireland that I come from there are 30,000 journeys across the Border on a daily basis for work, social and education reasons so it is of huge significance there.  It is a great privilege to be at this committee and it shows the Seanad being highly relevant to the people outside of it.  I wish the Chairman well in the deliberations and congratulate him on his selection as Chairman.  I wish him well in co-ordinating our discussions and ensuring they hit the spot to the extent that they become part of the negotiations and input them directly.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Waters and the other guests for their appearance before the committee today and I will put a number of specific questions to them.  Does Mr. Waters anticipate negotiations between Ireland and the UK on the matters discussed which will be separate to the overall negotiations between Mr. Barnier and his team and the UK Government?  Will we be facilitated as a subset of the overall negotiations with separate negotiations to deal with these issues and the common travel area specifically?  It merits mentioning, in the context of Mr. Waters presentation, that the relationship between the UK and Ireland is at an all-time high and has been excellent in recent years.  It would be a great pity for the outcome of these negotiations to jeopardise that because of the historic kinship, the fact that there are so many people of Irish extraction in the UK and the ties, bonds, trading and relationships.  We have to be vigilant to achieve that and also to achieve our domestic interests.<\/p><p>It is interesting that Mr. Waters said each side in the common travel area should now adopt the same attitude to third parties, that is, when non-EU nationals try to come into either jurisdiction that the same rules would apply.  Could he comment a little more on how that might play out in a situation where the UK in a post-EU membership scenario - we still cling to the hope that might not arise but, unfortunately, it looks like it will - would adopt a different immigration policy and that as part of the EU we would have the EU's immigration policy, and free movement for citizens of member states?  Does Mr. Waters see an obstacle there and how does he think it could be overcome?  I would like to be reassured by him that we can maintain the common travel area and yet operate those two different policies should that divergence arise.  It would seem that is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>for Brexit in the first instance, and that it would apply to tourist visas to which he referred.  I ask Mr. Waters to address those issues.<br\/><br\/>I was at a committee meeting on the Irish language recently, coiste na Gaeilge.  One would assume that Brexit could not greatly impact there, but there was a presentation on how Brexit could impact on the Irish language community and it was pointed out that 9,000 students from Northern Ireland go to Gaeltachts in Donegal every year and that many other students transfer between the North and South in various colleges, for example, in Monaghan and Enniskillen, and to various university courses.  That was just a practical day-to-day reality that would not have occurred to me had I not been at the meeting.  Brexit has significant implications for ordinary life on a day-to-day basis.  The discussion is highly relevant and very serious and I look forward to the responses from Mr. Waters on those issues.  He might come back later on if issues arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#B00300","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490266800,"counter":2151,"content":"<p>I too wish you well Chairman, as we go through this process, which is a very worthy use of our time in the Seanad.  I also join with the Chairman in condemning what happened in Westminster yesterday.  We have strong, close ties with the people in Westminster and what happened opens up the world to the dangers we now have, given that migration happens across the world.  I do not for one moment suggest that the person behind the atrocity was a migrant into the UK but we are living in a very changed world, a dangerous one, and that will present problems as we move through Brexit, certainly based on a lot of the thinking that lay behind the referendum.  I will not ask Mr. Waters to speculate on the thinking of the UK political system in driving towards Brexit.<\/p> <p>  While this committee is focused on solutions only I very much appreciate Mr. Waters coming here today and setting the context of one of the most serious problems we have.  I understand that he is no position to show the Irish negotiating hand by offering anything by way of solutions today but he might offer some clarity and for that I am most grateful.  The first issue of concern to me is that for most people living in the North of Ireland they have the opportunity to carry with them and Irish passport, a British passport or both.  In other words, they can claim dual nationality.  That will present serious problems, leaving aside the desire to travel, as we can have a situation whereby people who are subject to the protections of European laws by virtue of their Irish citizenship are living in a jurisdiction that has no truck with the European Union.  The UK is leaving the club and when it leaves the club it is no longer a member and cannot expect to be treated in the same way as members of the club.  Regardless of what we in Ireland or they in the UK think about borders, border checks or anything else, there are 26 other partners to be considered and what they want will be of great concern as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  However, there is a small group, 100,000 people in the North of Ireland, who were not covered by the Good Friday Agreement, who were not entitled to dual citizenship, mostly highly qualified academics or people in the catering sector.  I speak of ex-pats who came into the North as consultants, university lecturers and restaurant owners of a myriad of different nationalities.  They were naturalised in Northern Ireland and hold UK passports and their children are entitled to joint citizenship.  Those people have now formed a lobby group because they feel extremely vulnerable in a post-Brexit world because they will only hold a British passport while their children are entitled to hold both a British and an-Irish based EU passport.  One could have a ridiculous situation where a parent travelling with children will not be entitled to the same freedom of movement as their children.  That might be a question for Mr. O'Dwyer.  I do not know whether the issue has arrived on his desk yet but it has certainly come to mine and it is one that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  I accept there can be no bilateral negotiations outside the Brexit negotiations chaired by Michel Barnier.  However, does Mr. Waters agree that under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement our two jurisdictions have a common cause, namely the peace process?  I ask his advice more than anything else but am happy to accept if he does not wish to deal with the issue.  Could the Good Friday Agreement be leveraged in order to allow us to bring forward recommendations that could be brought to Michel Barnier?  At a recent meeting in Brussels Mr. Barnier pointed out to us that he is open to solutions and it strikes me that one of the best places to find solutions is through common dialogue between ourselves and the UK, but Mr. Waters cannot do that because he is barred from having bilateral meetings.  However, the Good Friday Agreement allows us to engage in conversations and perhaps come forward with recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The final issue of concern to me is education, coming from an education background as I do.  I refer to the number of students travelling back and forth between the two countries.  In the good old days of the HSS ferry in D&uacute;n Laoghaire there were many students getting on the boat in the morning to travel to Wales and coming back in the evening.  I am not sure whether that happens any more.  I estimate we have approximately 30,000 students in the UK.  I am not sure how many students from Northern Ireland travel south but a considerable number travel North, which will create specific problems.<\/p> <p>  This is my final point.  We try to mirror the rules in the UK and Ireland to enable the common travel area, yet in the case of Chinese nationals at one time the rules pertaining in the UK were slightly different and allowed easier access for Chinese students to access education programmes and then when we relaxed ours the British tightened up theirs.  Is that a strategic thing or is it something that just happens by osmosis?  I thank Mr. Waters for his time.  I very much appreciate him taking the time to come here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#C00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1490266800,"counter":2152,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell.

I also thank the members.  Quite a lot was raised in the questions, including issues that cut to the heart of the challenges we face.  I will start with what Senator O'Reilly said about the negotiations.  I will also invite my colleagues to respond on the same issue.  Clearly no formal negotiations can take place until such time as the Article 50 process has been triggered and no negotiations have taken place.  Senator Craughwell made a similar point.<\/p><p>This is not to say that we have closed down conversations between the UK and ourselves.  We have many fora in which Members of the Oireachtas, the Government, and we as officials are involved.  Specifically, in our case, we have the Common Travel Area Forum where we meet with our equivalents in the Home Office every quarter to talk about issues relating to our respective jurisdictions and the common travel area.  That process has continued because it relates to the operation of the common travel area.  Clearly it would be nonsense for all of us to stop doing that when it is in our respective interests.  What has not happened is a formal negotiation which would be triggered after the Article 50 process.  We are committed and will remain as part the EU and we will be part of that formal negotiation process. <\/p><p>  Picking up on remarks by Senators Craughwell and O'Reilly on the case we have made to the EU Commission, the specific point that we have made relates to Northern Ireland and the unique circumstances around the peace process.  We think we have made a very good case to the Commission for the common travel area issues to be addressed in a particular way.  Clearly, I am not in a position to say what will happen on that eventually in the context of Article 50 but we believe we have made the strongest possible case, supported at political and Government level by Ministers and the Taoiseach, in stressing very strongly the question of Northern Ireland, the peace process, and that the arrangements that now exist between our two countries pre-date our membership of the EU by a very long time.  <\/p><p> We have put our best foot forward and it will be some time in the not too distant future when we will have a better sense of what will happen with that.  In the meantime, we will continue with the co-operation that we will need to have with our colleagues in the UK.  Thinking of the appalling events in London yesterday, security and police co-operation has never been better.  Senator O'Reilly mentioned that.  That will continue, Brexit or no Brexit.  There are issues around it relating to extradition and arrest warrants which we might return to later, but nevertheless there will be no diminution of the level of co-operation required to deal with matters such as the appalling events which occurred yesterday.  It is in everyone's interest on this island, in the UK and around Europe.   I have to confess I am not aware of Senator Craughwell's point about people with dual nationality.  My colleagues may have further information on this.  It strikes me that people who are living in Northern Ireland in that category may be able to apply for Irish naturalisation.  That maybe a solution to it.  If my colleagues cannot clarify that I will be happy to come back to him on that point.  <\/p><p> Senator Craughwell also mentioned education and people travelling back and forward.  That easy free movement back and forward cuts to the heart of the common travel area.  That is what we want to preserve.  We want no change in that.  We have made the case as strongly as we can to ensure that continues.  I should say our Department relates to the movement of people.  Goods and services as they fall under the common travel area relate to the relevant Departments.  No doubt, in due course this committee will want to talk to people from those Departments but the common travel area facilitates all those other activities and clearly we have a session in respect of that.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly also mentioned non-EU nationals and what might happen after Brexit.  Given that we operate a mini-Schengen area within the EU between ourselves and the UK, we police each others' border in regard to non-EU nationals.  Immediately following the Brexit vote, there were some remarks - not in this jurisdiction - that were a little wide of the mark, which suggested that we would be operating border controls in respect of the UK in respect of EU nationals.  No.  That is a red line issue.  We simply cannot do that because for us to do so would be a complete deviation of our responsibilities to the EU under freedom of movement.  We will not do that and we have made absolutely clear that there are no circumstances under which we will do so.  Whether the position changes under the UK's rules after Brexit, the rationale behind the common travel area is that we respect each others borders in respect of the arrangements that other states may make in respect of non-EU nationals.  Our systems tend to align very closely.  If I recall correctly, and my colleagues might clarify, the only major departure in that area is that we do not have a visa requirement for citizens from South Africa whereas the UK does.  That goes back to historic reasons to do with missionaries and religious orders.  We work with them around that to ensure that we respect each others responsibilities there.  We need to have that assurance from both jurisdictions that when someone is stopped at an Irish border, the person would not also be let into the UK.  In fact, uniquely, when an Irish emigration officer stops someone at Dublin airport, for example, one of the grounds by which they can refuse the person entry into Ireland is that the person may intend to travel on to the UK.  That is how that works in practice, but I stress that it is in respect of third-country nationals, that is non-EU nationals, and that will remain after Brexit.  That is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Waters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490266800,"counter":2155,"content":"<p>Will this work?

I would not want to be alarmist.  I have no sense of why a situation like the one outlined by Senator Craughwell would arise, it does not make sense to me.  The nature of immigration is that what is not a problem today could well become a problem later.  For example, last year or the year before, we had a major problem with very significant numbers of people from a far eastern country coming to Ireland after their immigration permission for the UK had run out of time.  They used the common travel area.  It took us about 18 months to get on top of that, with both jurisdictions working together to ensure that we respected each others' borders.  We dealt with that appropriately and that problem has been solved but 18 months ago that problem was not there.

Establishing the committee was a decision of the Seanad.  In time, we might tweak how we do our business.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, I will stick to the topic, namely, the common travel area.  I will make a few comments before asking three questions.  The UK's decision to leave the EU presents unprecedented political, economic and diplomatic challenges to our peace and prosperity that we will be dealing with for months and years to come.  This will be a slow, years-long process.  These challenges will define the future of our island and our people for decades.<\/p> <p>  I read a document on Ireland's Brexit priorities that was circulated with our papers.  I am glad that the four top designated issues are the future of the EU, the economy and trade, Northern Ireland and the peace process, and the common travel area.  The document refers to the challenges of Brexit.  No one in the Chamber underestimates those challenges.  To be fair to parliamentarians, the Civil Service and the political establishment, we all know what the challenges are; we can keep rehearsing them, but it is important that we identify how best to move forward.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General mentioned the all-island civil dialogue process.  I acknowledge the good work that it and its stakeholders have done in preparing and feeding into the Brexit process and how we develop our priorities.  They have made an invaluable contribution to discussions, including ours, on Brexit preparations.  Arising from that extensive work, the document outlines important information.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a housekeeping issue before asking my three questions.  It is important that, if this committee is to be effective, we communicate the message of what we are doing and have free-flowing engagement on our documentation, discussions, etc.  The National Forum on Europe, of which I was a member for many years, is a model that worked well.  The Department is familiar with it.  The committee might consider its example of engaging with civil society and other groups in an open flow of information.  Sometimes, we might as well be talking in a vacuum.<\/p> <p>  Will it be necessary to impose a border on travel?  Where is the most practical point to impose that border, if required?  Surely the witnesses have had thoughts on this matter.  Given that Ireland does not participate in the Schengen Agreement, is there scope for us or the UK to operate a common visa or immigration system in our own right?  Can we have a bilateral arrangement in that regard?  The witnesses might tease out the logistics of these questions.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  This is a good start.

I also want to be associated with the good wishes and sympathies expressed to those slain and injured in Westminster yesterday.

While our sympathies and thoughts are with all of the families affected, they are particularly with our fellow citizen.<\/p> <p>  Instead of asking questions, I will make a number of statements and raise a few ideas that I would like the witnesses to tease out.  \"Hypothetical\" is not the right word regarding this debate, but there is no right or wrong answer.  Article 50 has not been officially triggered yet, so we have no idea.  Teasing out all of the positive and negative inevitabilities is the reason for our committee.  There is an old saying - in life, one plans for the worst and hopes for the best.  That should get people somewhere in between.<\/p> <p>  Were this situation to go badly from an Irish perspective and become a hard Brexit, with a stand-off between the 26 other member states and the UK and our common travel area unable to be maintained, what would the consequences be and what actions would the witnesses deem necessary for us to take in respect of people who are essentially domiciled in Ireland?  I am being hypothetical with this worst case scenario.  When people think of the common travel area, they think of ease of travel, no visas, flying over in the morning and back this evening without having to apply to anyone, etc.  It also means that there is no limit to a person's stay.  There are Irish people who flew over to London 40 years ago and have not flown back yet.  Where would they stand in this if the situation went wrong and became a hard Brexit?<\/p> <p>  Some Irish people living in England, citizens of the South living in the North and citizens of the North living in the South have set up businesses.  What will happen in that scenario to the Irish passport holder and business person who is currently working under EU regulations?  We are being told that the period will be two years.  I do not believe that, but we must work with what we have been told.  That person is still an Irish citizen and, hence, a European citizen, but what of tax and workers' rights issues?<\/p><p>Across the board everything changes.  Will we see a case of an Irish citizen who is an employer or a business person who is domiciled in what will be a non-EU state taking a case for their rights as a European citizen?

Our work here involves looking at the various options.  We do not know what the EU will look for, and everyone is looking at the North being a back door into Britain and wondering how the common travel area can be sustained.  The EU's concern is that it does not want us to be a back door from the UK into the EU, and that issue was raised at the House of Lords, where Mike Nesbitt brought up the issue of the Border being in the middle of the Irish Sea.  I brought that up yesterday when we were having meetings with the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee  in Westminster.  They already have Operation Gull in place in Northern Ireland, where they have immigration officers checking people travelling from Derry, Belfast and Larne into Britain.  Formalising that and having a standardised check so that everybody leaving the island of Ireland would be checked for immigration would mean that there would be no necessity for any checks on people going over and back across the border.  These are all different scenarios based on what the EU might propose.  It was reported in <i>The Guardian<\/i>that  it was proposed in the House of Lords that Ireland would be installing UK immigration officers at our ports and taking an all-island approach, which is unacceptable.  Has that been explored with the British authorities?  It is an unwelcome piece of kite flying.<\/p><p>A professor with an interest in this area has spoken about Protocols Nos. 19 and 20 which allow the common travel area and said that it is not incompatible with EU law.  Does the witness have a view on that?  Are we going to have to enforce UK immigration law and EU immigration law on people who are entering and leaving this island?  <\/p><p>The figures provided are interesting.  We are working on it in the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is difficult to get accurate figures for the numbers of people travelling over and back across the Border.  We hear of 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 people travelling over and back across the Border every day for work and study.  When one looks at the census results from 2011 - I am sure the witness has seen them - there are 14,751 people doing this.  The witness gave us figures.  When we looked for research on those who leave the island of Ireland and going to Britain every day who are Irish passport holders the figure was 5,722.<\/p><p>Our position is based on the facts.  Our first wish is for the <i>status quo<\/i>to remain because we would like to retain what we have.  We then have to ask if we can retain the common travel area and ensure that whatever restrictions the EU might put on it do not impinge on people.  If that is not possible, can we ensure that the Border between the North and South remains open and that all checks are carried out on the island of Ireland?  That requires Britain to reinstate what it did during a period between 1939 and 1952, when it imposed what was effectively immigration controls between Northern Ireland and Britain.<\/p><p>Getting the hard facts and having a position based on that is the key to the common travel area.  We have to consider the practicality of this.  We all travel over and back between Ireland and Britain.  People travel from France into Britain.  France is in Schengen.  What is the difference for somebody who is arriving from France into Britain today?  What passport controls do they have to go through?  Is it a simple matter of producing one's passport?  Ireland is not in Schengen.  France is in Schengen.  Are citizens treated differently, and if so what is the difference?  How does it compare to the people who travel over and back across the Border every day?  At yesterday's meeting with the British Members of Parliament it was said that they could not possibly formalise an immigration control check that they have in Derry, Belfast and Larne.  Some 792 people who were trying to get into Britain through Northern Ireland by travelling to the Republic and crossing the Border have been arrested in one calendar year.  Once the word gets out that everybody trying to get into Britain through Northern Ireland will get caught then nobody is going to bother trying to get into Britain via that route.  Britain seems to be saying that it might put seamless or frictionless controls on the Border.  The only people that affects are people who are travelling back and forth and going about their daily business on this island, and it will not affect those people positively. <\/p><p>Is it the case that Protocols Nos. 19 and 20 mean that our common travel area does not affect EU law?  We are having a big battle over the common travel area.  Is there a difference in how a person from France who is travelling to Britain today is treated compared to a person from Ireland?  Is it worth having this battle?  The most important battle is making sure that we do not have border checks on this island.  When we emphasise this to public representatives here and in America and elsewhere, it is said that if an electronic border checkpoint is put up and it is shot then a fence has to be erected.  If the fence is taken down a soldier has to be installed to protect it.  The soldier might then get shot.  That is how these things can escalate.  We are trying to convey to our European colleagues that this is not the border between Norway and Sweden.  This is a post-conflict society that is still emerging from conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#F00600","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490266800,"counter":2171,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators.  I will revert to Senator Boyhan first.  I acknowledge the Senator's points on the question of having a separate visa within the common travel area post-Brexit to enable us to function as we are at the moment.  In reality, when it comes to non-EU nationals, such as the Chinese people I referred to in my opening remarks, the British-Irish visa scheme is essentially a separate visa which enables them to come to London, to travel across the Irish Sea, to visit the Guinness Storehouse, to go to Killarney or Kilkenny or the Cliffs of Moher, and when they are done to go to the Titanic Centre in Belfast and then back down to Dublin completely seamlessly.  The co-operation we have with the UK has enabled this to happen.  That mirrors to a large extent what happens in Schengen.<\/p><p>As I understand it, when people apply for a Schengen visa, and we are not in Schengen now, they may a apply for a visa in Riga and may travel from Riga in northern Europe, up on the Baltic coast, right down to the southern Mediterranean on the same visa.  What we do with the UK in respect of the British-Irish visa effectively mirrors that.  Clearly it is in our national interest, and it is a public policy prerogative for us, to retain that.  We want to keep that.  That is really important because that is generating genuine business in this country.  It is important for tourism, for business and for ease of travel.  We want to retain that and we anticipate that we should, because it relates to non-EU nationals or third-country nationals.  <\/p><p> The challenge for us then relates to EU nationals, the people who come from the other member states into Ireland.  Clearly we are not going to interfere in any way with their rights of free movement, whether into Ireland, Spain, the UK or any other country.  We are not, in any way, going to interfere with that.  For us to even attempt to go there would clearly call into question our commitment as EU members and that is simply not going to happen.  We are committed, completely and totally, to respecting the free movement rights of EU nationals.  <\/p><p> Picking up on Senator Mark Daly's point, there is no question of UK officials acting as border agents in Ireland.  That, again, is simply not on.  There was some comment about that in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.  Perhaps that comment was a little bit misinformed because we are not going to exercise a border control function for EU nationals on behalf of the UK.  We do, to all intents and purposes, exercise that function in respect of non-EU nationals.  The benefit of that, as I spoke about, is having a common visa to enable people to come into Ireland, to travel to the UK and the North and to move around the area without let or hindrance.  Our intention is that would remain.  I think that deals with Senator Boyhan's point if I understand it.  <\/p><p> To address Senator Daly's comments on the hard Brexit, the Senator painted what I would call a dystopian scenario.  There are not two ways of putting it.  A situation where there was a completely hard Brexit, everything was off the table and the common travel area was gone would be very bleak.  Major issues would immediately arise for the freedom of movement and the freedom to reside, work, educate and live on the island, North and South, not to speak of people being able to travel, as we have all our lives, to the UK and remain as long as we like.  That would be an entirely bleak situation for Ireland in terms of our economic activity and ability to trade.  <\/p><p> The Government is working as best it can to avoid that happening, hence, as I said at the outset, we have made our case very strongly to the European Commission to retain the particular arrangements we have in respect of the common travel area.  We can only wait to see how that actually works out.  I think that picks up a point by the Senator's colleague, Senator Paul Daly.  There is no sugar coating this in terms of the scenario the Senator has painted.  It would be a very difficult situation for our country if we found ourselves in the position of having to reintroduce border controls on the Border.  We would have to re-introduce border controls at all our ports of entry because we would effectively be the border for the EU.  The UK would be a third country.  We would be enforcing the border for everybody with no regard to our own particular arrangements in the common travel area.  <\/p><p> That actually speaks to another related point.  Before Brexit, the question was often raised as to why do we not just leave the common travel area or why can we not be in Schengen and the common travel area.  The simple answer is that we cannot be in both.  It is actually to our advantage.  It is an arguable point, and obviously a call made by Governments over the years, whether it was more beneficial to Ireland to be in Schengen or to be in the common travel area.  The debate has gone on post-Brexit and the argument is essentially says that it is in our national interest to be in the common travel area.  The fact that we are not in Schengen is actually helpful in the context of the arguments that we are making to the Commission about the special nature of the arrangement between ourselves and the UK, not to speak of the peace process and the fact that so many people in the North, one million people, are entitled to Irish passports.  All of those issues together make the argument, very strongly, for where we want to be.  Again, the situation the Senator has raised would be very bleak.<\/p><p> There is another point which I am glad Senator Daly has brought out.  It is in terms of how we actually operate at the moment.  Not a lot of people know about the amount of information that travels back and forward between our respective jurisdictions and which helps to make us all safer.  We have advanced passenger information, API.  I might ask my colleague, Mr William O'Dwyer, to talk about that in a moment.  This is information shared by airlines with the immigration authorities, back and forward across the Irish Sea.  This is an important reassurance for everybody to know who is coming into our jurisdictions.  I think people need not have concerns around that because there are no issues, that information is destroyed instantly.  There are not large banks of data being kept and collated for any other nefarious purpose.  Perhaps my colleague,  Mr. James Martin, might come in on this as well.  There is a passenger name records directive coming into play in May of next year.  We are obliged to sign up to it.  This again will require all the authorities, both in Europe and outside of it, to share information about people who are travelling between jurisdictions.  <\/p><p> Perhaps Mr. O'Dwyer will now come in on the matter of API.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Waters","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490266800,"counter":2173,"content":"<p>This goes to the point made earlier in respect of the importance of protecting the outer border of the common travel area, the CTA.  On that basis, our UK colleagues share a lot of information on things like visas and people of concern to the CTA generally so that individual border officers have information at their disposal to make decisions on people arriving.  Advance passenger information is essentially information taken off the machine readable zone of the passport plus a few extra flight details.  That is sent in advance of a flight arriving in the State.  It allows for advance checks to be done on arriving passengers.  Last year we made arrangements with the UK that it would be able to collect this data on Irish-registered carriers flying in and out of the UK.  That arrangement has worked very well.  The UK is collecting the data from at least one carrier and is seeking to obtain it from the remaining carriers.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that, from our own perspective, we are looking at putting a similar system in place around the middle of the year.  It will initially start collecting advance passenger information from flights arriving from outside the EEA, but the passenger name record, PNR, directive, which my colleague will speak on shortly, will allow us to expand that collection into flights arriving from within the EEA as well.  In a way data-sharing is at the heart of preserving and protecting the CTA.  Those arrangements that are in place are of a long-standing nature.  As Mr. Waters said earlier in respect of our powers at the Border, we have specific power to refuse a third country national who intends to travel to the UK and who would not be acceptable for entry there.  There are similar provisions in the UK in respect of people who might want to come here but would not be acceptable for entry into Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490266800,"counter":2174,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the questions around Protocols No. 19 and 20 of the Schengen Agreement and the common travel area.  I hope Members will forgive me for being slightly long-winded, but it is best to explain it from an historical perspective.  First of all, before I start on that, the question about what the position of Irish people will be in the UK post-Brexit is really a question for the British to decide.  They have said that they want to maintain the common travel area and, by implication, maintain all the rights, but it is purely a decision for the UK.  It is not necessarily part of the negotiations.  There are negotiations about reciprocal rights.  If one looks at Ireland in 1922, the common travel area meant Irish people could go to Britain.<\/p><p>There was free travel and the right to work.  When we joined the European Union in 1973, that gave us certain rights to free movement.  It meant that we could move to France to look for a job under certain specific conditions.  It did not provide for free movement in the sense that border controls remained in place between Ireland and France and between France and Germany.  There was no free movement, even though there were certain rights such as a right to work and things like that, but one could not just cross a border.  It was only following the signing of the Lisbon treaty that the Schengen area idea was introduced.  In one context, it removed border controls.  After the introduction of the Schengen area, a person living in France could cross into Germany without border controls.  In a sense, it is mirrored in the common travel area.  There are no border controls between Ireland and the United Kingdom and we have the right to work there.  The EU arrangements mirror that system.  When the provision was included in the Treaty of Lisbon, there was a question for Ireland and the United Kingdom to decide, namely, did they want to, in effect, abandon the common travel area and join the Schengen area?  A decision was made at that stage not to join.  Protocols 19 and 20 stated Ireland and Britain could stay outside the Schengen area and have their own border controls.  The Schengen area and the common travel area are very similar in terms of the arrangements applied.  When we travel to France, we have to show our passports because we are entering the Schengen area, but once we are in France, we can move between Schengen area countries.  When a French person travels to Ireland or Britain, he or she has to show a passport, despite having a right of entry.  Our legal staff have examined Protocols 19 and 20 and their advice to us has been that they stand.  Even though the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, Ireland still has a right to have border controls separate from the Schengen agreement.  No view from Brussels has stated that this is not correct.  If that continues to be the case, we can decide to have whatever border controls we want.  People living elsewhere in the European Union will still have a right to travel here, but we will have a right to check their passports.  It is to be hoped that position can be maintained.  As Mr. Waters said, we cannot be in the Schengen area and the common travel area because there has to be a border between the two.  Ireland is in the common travel area and the European Union, which means that we have reciprocal rights.  People from Ireland and the United Kingdom have rights in the common travel area and the European Union.  The problem will arise when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  The rights of Irish people living in the United Kingdom will be the rights we have in the common travel area but in not the European Union.  The rights of people from the United Kingdom who are living in Ireland will depend on what rights they will have in the common travel area rather than in the European Union.  Citizens of the European Union will retain exactly the same rights in Ireland as they have now.  Logic feeds from that which is connected to all other questions.  The view is that Protocols 19 and 20 mean that Ireland can remain outside the Schengen area and retain border controls.  That would mean that there could be no border controls with the United Kingdom.  That would not cause any problem for Schengen area countries.  Given that Ireland is outside the Schengen area, it would not be a back door.  The countries in the Schengen area could have border controls for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017032300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490266800,"counter":2176,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for their testimony.  We have received some assurances for EU nationals to ensure their free passage within Ireland would not be affected.  I am concerned for non-EU or third country nationals.  We have heard about the British-Irish visa scheme which has been significant.  As has been said, we have benefited from large increases in the numbers of tourists from China and elsewhere.  Concerns have been expressed, however, by Irish diplomats about the operation of the scheme.  For example, there are situations where Ireland wishes to issue a visa but there is a delay in processing on the other side.  There is a concern that if these delays are extended and become more systematic, it will become a point of leverage.  I ask the officials to outline their thoughts on the practical questions regarding the British-Irish visa scheme.<\/p> <p>  The United States recently introduced new policies on migration which are xenophobic and a source of serious concern.  They have been highlighted both here and elsewhere.  How do we ensure we will not be pressed, legally or practically?  It is important that Ireland remain an internationally connected country with strong relationships around the world.  It is important that we do not diminish our ability to engage with friendly countries and our right to issue visas.  Has a risk analysis been carried out of the possibility that xenophobic or other constraints would be introduced by Britain and how they would affect Ireland?  Many EU nationals have relationships with third country nationals which are recognised differently in different places.  Will the officials outline their thinking on that issue?  It is an important one.<\/p> <p>  I refer to advance passenger information systems within the European Union.  There is concern about the information which it is appropriate to exchange between Ireland and the United Kingdom.

As I said, the Prime Minister has been abundantly clear that the British Government is committed to retention of the common travel area.  The 11 points made on what it wanted to see post-Brexit included retention of the common travel area.  We have to take it at its word that it would not wish to see any change.

There were some issues and delays when the British-Irish visa scheme was initially introduced because part of the arrangement of the British-Irish visa scheme is a requirement that people give a fingerprint on their visa, which is a standard requirement in many countries.  We had to put in place practical arrangements with our UK colleagues to ensure that information was channelled to us and it was checked against our databases.  To the best of my knowledge, those issues have been resolved.  Perhaps in a moment, my colleague, Mr. O'Dwyer, might be able to comment further on that.<\/p> <p>  A concern was raised about issues similar to those with the United States arising in the UK.  We have to realise that we are ultimately a sovereign nation, subject to our participation in the EU and what goes through that with respect to our freedom of action and what policies we have.  The idea that we would be obliged to follow suit if the UK, unlikely as it is, introduced punitive arrangements for some people is not a practical proposition.  We depart with them already on the matter of nationals from South Africa due to our historical relationships.  That does not present a practical difficulty.  It would suit us better with regard to ease of work from an immigration perspective, but it is a policy issue for us in Ireland that South African nationals do not require visas.<\/p> <p>  On the passenger name records issue, that is coming and has been debated at length in Europe.  It will require all countries to exchange information with each other.  It is essentially showing us that people know who is entering their territories.  There are very strict guidelines around it on data and how long it is held.  It is held for really short periods in most cases.  It does not really arise for people where there are no hits on watch lists.<\/p> <p>  The UK having left the EU raises other issues with regard to the data protection regime that it will have post-Brexit, which is clearly one of the issues of concern to us and that we have not touched on today.  Issues around European arrest warrants, data protection, enforcement of civil proceedings, and the underpinnings of all those relates to the exchange of data.  The standard by which Europe operates is set down in various data protection directives.  A new one is coming in next year.  The UK would be required to be of the same standard as the European model for us to exchange information with the UK on that issue post-Brexit.  Whether it continues to be part of what we have at the moment or a new standard remains to be seen post-Brexit.  It is a clear issue which has to be addressed in the context of negotiations.  The UK has already indicated that it wishes to remain outside the European Court of Justice.  That is a problem of co-operation, because where there is a dispute with a European arrest warrant, it is ultimately resolved at the European Court of Justice.  The UK is going to have to find some solution to that.  We would like more detail from it on that, which we have not got yet.  Senator Higgins' points are well-made.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to comment on Scotland.
