I am accompanied by Mr. Patrick Kenny who is on my right.  As the Chairman said, Mr. Kenny is a member of the authority and also the director of the cartels division, which looks after the criminal enforcement side of our activity.  On my left hand side is Mr. John Evans, who is the manager of the monopolies division, which looks after the civil enforcement side.<\/p><p>  We are very happy to have the opportunity to explain the mission and role of the Competition Authority and to explain to the committee our activities in the areas of grocery supply and retailing.<\/p><p>  Our mission is to ensure that markets work well for Irish consumers, for business and for the economy as a whole.  Our focus is on ensuring that the competitive process works to respond to the needs and tastes of Irish consumers.  Increasingly in these tough times, as members have heard repeatedly in the sessions over the past few weeks, consumers are very focused on value for money.<\/p><p>  Competition plays a key role in improving the competitiveness of the economy and when speaking about competition we are speaking about more than costs.  Some people make their purchases based primarily on costs but competition is partly about that but is also about our ability to foster innovation, to improve quality and to achieve sustainable improvements in living standards and job opportunities for all.  This leads to greater choice, increased innovation and quality, lower prices to both business and consumers and of course to increased employment.<\/p><p>  Our role is to promote competition in the economy and for enforcing Irish and EU competition law.  We do so by taking action to deter anti-competitive behaviour.  A key role is the investigation of anti-competitive practices such as price fixing or other anti-competitive agreements or abusive conduct by firms that are dominant in the market.  Let me mention, that in one area we are different from competition authorities in other member states.  Our role is to investigate and either to make referrals to the Director of Public Prosecutions or to take a case before the courts.  We do not take decisions ourselves on breaches of the law, which is not our role but the role of the courts.  In some ways that is different from competition authorities in many other member states.  We also have responsibility for merger control in the State and this has been a very active area in the food and grocery sector in the past few years, including Glanbia's acquisition of Dawn Dairies and Golden Vale in 2011 and at the retail level we also reviewed and approved the take over by the Musgrave Group of Superquinn in 2011.<\/p> <p> We promote competition in many different ways.  For example, we examine the competitiveness of market sectors, advise Departments and other State agencies on competition issues and we promote a culture of competition more generally through activities such as road shows, information booklets, guidelines, conferences, seminars and so on.  In 2008, we published a detailed series of reports as part of our grocery monitoring project.  A number of specific aspects of competition law are currently in place which apply specifically to the grocery sector, under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 and I will speak more about these later.<\/p><p> To return to the point of what competition comprises, it is about more than simply selling goods at the lowest possible price.  The range of consumers benefit from variety in terms of price, quality, service and innovation.  Given the pressure on household budgets in recent years, Irish consumers increasingly seek value in their weekly shop.  They are becoming less brand-loyal and are migrating to own-brand offerings and discount retailers.  The proportion of the household budget spent on groceries varies significantly, in accordance with income levels.  In terms of income, the lowest 10% of households would spend up to one-fifth of their budget on food, much of it on essentials such as bread and milk.  Therefore, the availability of a range of goods at low prices is very important for vulnerable consumers.<\/p><p> I mentioned our role in competition enforcement and how we prepare cases and bring them to court or to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Competition enforcement is complex.  Good cases require not only credible evidence, but also witnesses who are willing to be put on the stand and cross-examined in court.  This, as we have discovered over the years, is easier said than done.  This applies to normal competition enforcement to which I have referred, such as anti-cartel activities, anti price fixing and the abuse of dominance.  It also applies to the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which was passed to address the perceived imbalance in bargaining power between large retailers and producers.  The Act makes certain practices illegal if they have an anti-competitive purpose or effect.  These practices include compelling or coercing payment, or granting of allowance, for the advertising or display of grocery goods, or a retailer compelling or coercing payment for providing space for grocery goods within a new retail outlet, a newly expanded outlet, or an outlet under new ownership, within 60 days after the opening of the outlet.<\/p><p> This Act was passed in 2006.  Our experience in the seven years since then has been that we have received few substantive complaints, basically for the reasons discussed substantially by the committee.  Smaller producers may be unwilling to complain to the authority or to take court action, which they are entitled to do, for fear of retribution which could mean delisting.  Larger producers suffer less of a power imbalance and they can negotiate on a more equal footing with retailers  and are less likely to need the protection offered under the Act. <\/p><p> The most recent policy proposals in the grocery sector recommended implementing a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings.  A number of consultations were carried out on this in 2009 and 2011.  On both occasions, the authority made submissions to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation&rsquo;s consultation pointing out the difficulties involved in enforcing codes of the kind proposed.  I mentioned the evidential difficulties of getting somebody who is prepared to go on the witness stand and face cross examination.  There is also a danger of significant compliance costs on small and large businesses alike, but more significantly for small businesses.  Also, codes may not solve the problem they are intended to solve, in that the power imbalance may remain, even when manifested through codes of conduct or a terms of business agreement. <\/p><p> However, I am here today to inform the committee that if the Minister decides to introduce such a code and decides the authority - the amalgamated competition and consumer agency, the legislation for which is being worked on by our parent Department - is the agency which will have the task of policing it, we will fulfil that role diligently.  Nobody has ever accused us of not doing the job we were given to do through legislation.  Given there is open debate still happening in the EU and that an adjudicator has just been appointed in the UK to oversee the grocery supply code of conduct, one proposal we would make would that it would be a good idea to set a term for review of the operation of any such code after a certain period. <\/p><p> I will conclude by saying we will be very happy to take any questions from the committee when my colleague has spoken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373979900,"counter":10,"content":"<p>My colleague, John Shine, and I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to it today and we hope to make a productive and positive contribution to its ongoing deliberations.  I intend to outline the statutory remit and role of the National Consumer Agency and to provide some information on our previous work and activities relevant to the grocery sector.<\/p><p>  The National Consumer Agency is the independent State body with responsibility for the enforcement of consumer law.  As a statutory body, our remit and functions are established by law, principally the Consumer Protection Act, 2007.  This Act, which transposed the EU unfair commercial practices directive is a maximum harmonisation directive, which means it limits our functions to the relationship between traders and consumers acting outside of their business trade or profession.  We carry out our functions within this context - which is somewhat different to how the Competition Authority carries out its functions.  Our mission is to protect consumers and to help bring about a situation where they are empowered to make well-informed decisions in fair and competitive markets.  We have a clear statutory mandate to serve and represent the interests of consumers. <\/p><p>  Since our establishment in 2007, the environment for consumers in Ireland has been transformed by the financial crisis and subsequent economic difficulties.  The impact this has had on consumers and their spending patterns has been dramatic, across all sectors, including the grocery sector.  I will expand on this point later.<\/p><p>  In summary, the work of the National Consumer Agency can be described as promoting consumer welfare by enforcing consumer law and advocating on consumer issues.  We provide a one-stop consumer information and education service via our websites, consumer helpline and public awareness activities.  We also have specific responsibilities in regard to the safety of consumer products and personal finance information and education.  As I mentioned, our statutory remit and focus is exclusively on the experiences of consumers in Ireland.  Therefore, we have no role in the business to business or supply chain relationship. <\/p><p>  The National Consumer Agency has a broad mandate and remit and an ever-increasing number of consumer issues compete for our resources.  We must, therefore, make choices in regard to what we do and how we do it in order to be effective.  Our decision-making is based on an assessment of consumer detriment and identifying where we can make the greatest impact.  Given the option of two competing issues, we prioritise the issue where we will have the best opportunity to mitigate the most consumer detriment.  We gather information through our direct contact with consumers.  Our consumer helpline received over 58,000 contacts from consumers last year.  We also acquire knowledge through our systematic market monitoring programme, direct market surveillance activity, media reports and information received from other agencies in Ireland and across the EU.<\/p><p>  The frequency and speed at which new issues arise requires us to be flexible and to react quickly.  Information is then evaluated and processed to identify the source and size of the problem, in particular the scale of consumer detriment, primarily financial, but not exclusively, and whether a potential breach of consumer law has occurred.   Our subsequent interventions are evidence based and are focused on the areas where we can make the greatest impact.  They often involve a number of complementary approaches across three pillars of activity, enforcement, advocacy and information-education for consumers. <\/p><p>  In cases where there is a potential breach of consumer law, a more formal process is required and we take into account the likely detriment experienced by consumers, the nature of the evidence that is available, whether additional evidence needs to be gathered, previous trader behaviour and any past actions, possible motives and the level of knowledge of the trader.  We may look for voluntary compliance where that is the most effective and efficient approach or use disruption to interrupt a practice where formal enforcement may take too long or cost too much.  However, in situations where formal enforcement action is appropriate, we will not hesitate to act and we have a number of options available.<\/p><p>  Our mandate is broad in that it crosses various sectors in which consumers operate, including the grocery sector.  As with all sectors, one of our main objectives is to ensure price transparency.  Consumers should know the price of a product or service before they buy it.  This is important so that consumers can make informed decisions.  It also helps to foster competition as consumers can use this information to choose where they take their business, which encourages businesses to compete with each other.  We carry out compliance blitzes to ensure that traders are complying with pricing legislation.  In 2012, we carried out visits to 349 traders nationwide, including a significant number in the grocery sector.  We also investigate complaints from consumers to establish if there are breaches of the Consumer Protection Act and if enforcement action should be taken.<\/p><p>  We carried out eight surveys on grocery prices between 2007 and 2011.  In our last survey, we found high levels of price matching among the four major grocery retailers.  In other words, the difference between the prices charged for branded products across the board was very low.<\/p> <p>We also found that competition seemed to be focused on special offers and promotions as opposed to price.  The National Consumer Agency has consistently called for a focus on everyday low pricing as a consumer-focused alternative to the &quot;hi-lo&quot; pricing associated with special offers and promotions.<\/p><p> Our most recent market research in the grocery sector, conducted in November 2012, found that almost half of all shoppers have made changes to their grocery shopping practices in order to reduce costs.  The main change indicated, by over 62% of those who made changes, was that they now shop around for better value.  Other changes include buying less, budgeting better, switching provider and changing brands.  Over three quarters of those surveyed, 79%, indicated that these changes have reduced the amount they spend on groceries. Consumers have responded to changes in their own circumstances, as well as responding to the behaviour of retailers.  Developments in the pricing behaviour of retailers have included an increase in price promotions, higher levels of price matching and development of own-brand ranges.<\/p><p> We focus our efforts where there is clear consumer detriment.  We ensure that businesses adhere to pricing legislation and work to increase price transparency in sectors where such transparency is lacking.  In the grocery sector, consumers have access to pricing information and can compare prices, should they wish to do so.  In 2007, on average, consumers spread their shopping over two and a half stores.  By 2013, on average, grocery shoppers are spreading their shopping over three stores.  That is a 20% increase and clearly shows that consumers are less loyal and are more open and willing to change store should they believe that better value is available to them. <\/p><p> In its invitation, the committee mentioned two specific areas that I will now address.  The first is the impact to the consumer on depleting produces, such as liquid milk.  This is essentially a matter of supply and demand, where reduced supply will likely lead to less choice and increased prices to consumers if there is no reduction in the level of demand for the product.  We would always advocate, where possible and relevant, for choice to be available to consumers to ensure that there is sufficient competition in the market in respect of price and quality of product.  CSO consumer price index figures for May 2013 show that the cost of whole milk has decreased by  0.6% over the previous 12 months.  However, it has been noticed that there has been an increase of between 5 cent and 10 cent per litre between May and June 2013.  Increases had not been seen in the price of milk for a considerable period of time prior to this.<\/p><p> The second specific topic which the Committee asked us to address was the impact of further consolidation of the grocery sector.  The National Consumer Agency has no direct remit in the matter of business consolidation, other than advocating for adequate competition in the marketplace to ensure that consumers are empowered and can make well-informed decisions in fair and competitive markets.  However, we note that there have been some contrasting developments in this area in recent years.  The acquisition of Superquinn by Musgrave and the decline in the numbers of small, independent retailers has occurred at the same time as the rapid expansion of two new entrants, Aldi and Lidl.  Therefore, while there has been consolidation in some areas of the market, new entrants have brought a valuable alternative to consumers, to which they seem open.<\/p><p> New retail planning guidelines were introduced in 2012 and we made a submission to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government when it was reviewing earlier RPGs in 2010.  The recommendations we made at that time on facilitating competition stated that it is more desirable to have the emphasis focusing on promoting increased competition, rather than maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>, which may play to the strengths of incumbents and deter new market entrants who could potentially be more efficient.   The latest RPGs state that the preferred site for new developments is in the city or town centre.  If this is not possible, then edge-of-centre locations may be considered.  Only if this is not possible, out of town development may then be considered.  We note that this sequential approach and its development limitations have had the effect of constraining the type of grocery retailer that can trade in an area.  This limits the range of goods they can offer and influences the price point at which they can operate, all of which may undermine the competitive environment and deny consumers choice and value in the retail market.<\/p><p> How consumers behave in response to changes in the market should not be understated.  Consumers are now increasingly open to new offerings.  They are reacting to market changes in their best interests; they are in effect playing the system to their advantage.  The National Consumer Agency&rsquo;s view is that there is a place for all retailers to compete for the benefit of consumers.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our strategic priorities and their relevance in the grocery sector.  We protect consumers by enforcing consumer law.  This includes price display legislation and in 2012, we pursued 520 complaints in price display and misleading pricing.  We empower consumers to make informed decisions.  It includes improving price awareness and transparency in markets where consumers find it hard to make informed decisions.  This does not appear to be the case in the grocery sector at this time, where consumers have access to pricing information and their behaviour indicates that they are increasingly aware of the alternatives available to them.  We also represent consumer interests, advocating and intervening on significant issues of consumer detriment.<\/p><p>  Finally, I thank you for the opportunity to address you today and my colleague and I are happy to take any questions you may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373980500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you.

In her submission, Ms Goggins stated that there were two elements of the 2006 Act that deal with the retail sector.  She stated that it only applied if there was an anti-competitive object as part of those.  My view is that it would be quite limited in terms of the questions being asked of the retail multiples by committee members over the last few months.  I presume somebody can ask for a supplier to contribute to the cost of a promotion that would not necessarily be anti-competitive.  The supplier is supplying that person and is not excluding anybody else.  While it may be illegal, it may not be illegal under the 2006 Act.  I would like Ms Goggins to expand on that.  When they were here, the representatives of the multiples were very strong in stating that the 2006 Act provides a mechanism for anybody who wants to make a complaint or raise an issue about any illegal practices that may be going on within their businesses.  Lo and behold, nobody has made a complaint so everybody is very happy with what is happening.  From looking at the presentation, it seems quite limited in what could be examined by the Competition Authority.  Perhaps Ms Goggins could expand on that.<\/p><p>  Ms Goggins also states that codes of practice are not always fit for purpose and do not solve the problems they were intended to solve.  Are there examples of codes of practice that are fit for purpose and codes that have failed as well?  That would be interesting for the committee's work.  Ms Goggins also states that the code of practice would impose significant compliance costs.  The representatives of the retail multiples in here over the last few months spoke very eloquently about how compliant they are and how much they spend on being compliant as things stand.  It was very difficult to get an idea from them as to where this extra cost would come from.  If they are already so compliant, it seems that there would not be significant extra costs in complying with a code of practice if it was brought in.  They failed to my satisfaction to give concrete details of what these compliance costs would be and how they would impact on their business.  Perhaps the Competition Authority might have some knowledge on that.<\/p><p>  My next question is for the Competition Authority again.  One of the issues that has come up in this committee is the price that primary suppliers are paid by creameries and the price paid in the supermarket for liquid milk.  Would it be anti-competitive to set a minimum price for the primary producer of a commodity or a product?  Would there be competition law problems with that if it was decided it was in the common good to have a level price for a product made by a producer?<\/p><p>  My final question is for the National Consumer Agency.<\/p> <p>Food costs in Ireland are 18% higher than the average across the European Union.  The multiples said this is due to the increased cost of doing business in Ireland but did not really elaborate on that.  Can the witnesses say, based on their own research whether that 18% differential is justified in the context of costs across Europe and other countries?  Do they accept that the 18% difference is justified?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600005#E00300","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373981100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests here today.  Over the past few months we have had detailed discussion with many large multiples and all the shareholders involved in this issue.  Like Deputy Pringle, I am not convinced by the arguments some of the multiples have made regarding the issues that seem to come up regularly.  Three players in the grocery sector dominate 70% of the market, Tesco, Dunne&rsquo;s and Super Valu.  That seems very uncompetitive to me.  Do the witnesses have a view on that or do they think it is healthy?  If not, where do they think we should be going?<\/p><p>  Groceries in Ireland seem to cost 17% or 18% more than the average price in 27 other countries.  That is a substantial percentage above the average in other EU countries.  If the Irish market is very competitive how come the prices are 17% higher than everywhere else?<\/p><p>  The National Consumer Agency said it received very few complaints in 2006.  Is there a reason for the absence of complaints?  Suppliers in particular are very much afraid to complain.  Last week I told the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development about a particular supplier which I had visited in my constituency in the past couple of weeks.  It supplies 55% of a certain product in the country to a certain supermarket, a substantial amount of product to supply, and it would be afraid to make a complaint.  It told me that it has to pay money up-front in order to get onto the shelves of that particular supermarket.  It specified that there was one particular supermarket above the rest that would look for extra money.  I understand that is a very delicate matter.  Do we need to get to the bottom of some issues?  Why should a supplier have to pay extra money?  At the end of the day the consumer pays.  That ties into my point about our grocery costs being 17% higher than those anywhere else in the EU.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  We have had a very worthwhile discussion over the past couple of months with almost all the people involved, with one exception, who did not grace us with her presence.  We have to deal with what we did get.<\/p><p>  Codes of practice are the kernel of the matter.  There has been an independent adjudicator in place in England for a very short time.  Does the National Consumer Agency have any indication how that is working out and would it be in regular contact with its counterparts on the other side of the pond about that system?  There has been a great deal of talk about whether it should be a voluntary or a statutory code.  Does the National Consumer Agency think we should go down the voluntary road?  I think anything that is voluntary will not happen.  It needs to be mandatory.  What is the agency&rsquo;s view on that matter?<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned the compliance cost and some of the multiples reminded us several times that they have a very good structure in place whereby they are able to assess everything.  In view of the fact that it is in place there should not be an extra large cost involved.  Where does the National Consumer Agency see the compliance costs?<\/p><p>  The horsemeat issue earlier in the year could have been a disaster for the country.  We discussed that at length at the time.  There is a view that one reason for this problem is that it is a cheaper product that is similar to the main product which companies thought they were buying.  Is that also a result of competition forcing down the price?  Perhaps because of the times we are in when money is scarce the general consumer looks for value for money at the expense of quality.  We did not know what we were getting in the horsemeat and we still do not know in some cases.  Does the Competition Authority have a view on that issue?  Are we losing out because times are difficult and costs are being forced down at the expense of quality?  Likewise liquid milk, an area in which I have a personal interest: the price to the producer in recent years has been similar while the price to the consumer has risen gradually.  There may have been a small rise in recent times but it would appear that milk is being used as a loss leader in most outlets.  Does the Competition Authority agree or am I talking rubbish?  To Joe Public who produces the milk that appears to be the case.  It is left to one side and used as a special offer to draw the customer in to buy something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600006#F00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1373981100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>How many prosecutions were taken in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and of those prosecutions how many were successful?

This is an issue close to my heart.  The multiples have the financial strength which protects them against the primary producer.  I believe they need to display their profits here because when they deal with their suppliers in many cases they ask them to open up their books.  There is a double standard.  They dissect the books of their suppliers and decide if the supplier is entitled to any profit and if so how much.  The State, however, does not know what is going on.  This is double dealing and I do not like it.  These are realities.<\/p><p>  I hope everybody goes home today and remembers the word \"potholing\".  I am not talking about Cork County Council sorting out a few holes in the road.  This refers to a supplier selling a particular product and getting maybe &euro;100,000 a month.  Then its accounts show a dip for a particular month when it gets paid &euro;50,000 and the buyer says it is filling a financial pothole and will get back to the supplier.  The margins are tight enough in these contracts that this type of practice should not go on but it is going on.  Market support is a kind phrase for hello money.  There are many others.  This is the elephant in the room.  We are discussing these very serious issues which are crippling the primary producers in a country where agriculture is one of the main income streams.  We have to deal with this.  Obviously the multiples do not have the moral backbone to deal with it.  Some are better than others and it is wrong to castigate everybody.<\/p><p>  I do the shopping quite regularly and I agree with the witnesses that there are little or no price differences in branded products.  I am one of those who go to several multiples for items which are better quality in some than in others.<\/p> <p>They are using price promotions.  One would need to work out the cost per millilitre or per gramme on an iPad.  The consumer is not saving money; there is no transparency.  As a person who grew up on a dairy farm the milk issue really annoys me.  I saw how hard my father worked all his life and I appreciate how hard dairy farmers work.  It is a 24-hour job, every day of the year.  Their professionalism is outstanding and the quality of their product is amazing.  However, they are being dealt with in an unfair manner.  They came to this committee a short time ago and told us that they are slowly going out of business.  This is shocking and wrong.  They are going out of business because they are not getting a fair price for their product.  These people are doing what we asked them to do but we need to protect them.  The multiples are taking greedy profits on the back of these people's life's work and that is wrong.  I hope that message is heard by the multiples.<\/p><p> When the price of milk paid to the farmers fell a few years ago to 26 cent a litre, the branded milk product was selling in the stores from &euro;1.49.  When the product price fell to 19 cent a litre we should have seen the &euro;1.49 drop to around &euro;1 a litre but this did not happen and the farmer continued to receive a price he could not sustain.  There is a race to the bottom.  The multiples are asking the primary producers to live on depreciation.  People will have heard me make the argument before.  Money is needed as profit but money is also needed to reinvest into the business, to put in the extra stainless steel and to abide by all the regulations.  One of my colleagues spoke about the horsemeat situation.  Can a consumer rightly expect to buy a burger that was sold for 8 cent when its actual cost should have been 80 cent?  The consumer still pays out but is not getting the value or the truth.  Our system of labelling needs to be examined.  One would need to have a degree in food labelling to understand which was the country of origin.  The primary producers have had a love-hate relationship with the Competition Authority over the years.  I am a tillage farmer and I have seen shiploads of grain coming into the country.  However, I appreciate that the authority has a job to do.  The primary producers believe they are not being dealt with fairly.  They believe that other parties on the opposite end of the equation are getting away with behaviour that is not being exposed whereas the primary producer is fully in the limelight.<\/p><p> The challenge for us all is to find a solution to the problem, perhaps by means of a mandatory code of practice because the voluntary codes have not worked.  Our dairy farmers, cereal farmers and our small businesses build up business on the back of good behaviour only to find out that they are being put to the sword.  This goes to the heart of the success of our food industry.  We all have a role to play but we need solutions rather than talk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600006#F00400","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373981700,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  Deputy Deering and Deputy Barry have raised most of my points so I will be brief.  I have spoken confidentially to a few small suppliers.  I am a supplier and I employ 110 people.  I know how difficult it is for suppliers.  I have a lot of friends in the food industry because I have been in business for 21 years.  Some of the people I spoke to confidentially said that listing fees are still in operation but the language has changed.  Humans are very creative and it is no longer called \"hello money\" or a listing fee.  Deputy Barry referred to pot-holing but I have not come across that myself although I have been asked for it by English multiples as recently as last year.  When their accounts do not meet their shareholders' requirements at the end of the year they ask their suppliers for contributions.  However, I have never been asked for that by an Irish company.  Who has the money to take a full page advertisement in the Sunday newspapers?  I wonder who pays for those adverts.  One of the suppliers to whom I spoke had been told that if their product was to be promoted it would be put on a lovely coloured page in the Sunday Independent and there would be a cost.  This is the practice.<\/p><p>  Has the Competition Authority considered having a focus group, an internal bunker focus group of 20 to 40 small suppliers?  They could feed information to the authority in greater detail than the committee can provide.  The issue of horsemeat has been well covered.  No supplier wants to be driven down to that level.  Another issue which must be faced is the advertisement of low-cost alcohol.  I have a 19 year old son so I know all about it.  I do not drink beer or cider as I prefer wine but I am surprised at the cheap prices of those drinks.  The word, \"footfall\" is a favourite of the multiples.  Cheap beer or a tin of sweets - Roses, I think - at Christmas are regarded as footfallers; they are designed to get the consumers to walk in the door of the supermarket and they are then captive.  I had an audit last week which was carried out by an Australian retailer.  It is easy for me because my business is 80% export.  The practices are the same all over the world.  They looked at my books and studied the percentage taken by each customer.  I have an open book costing system so they can see my suppliers.  As a Deputy said, the one-way street is unfair. I am a very small player with just a few random comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600007#G00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373981700,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Quite a few topics for discussion and some very interesting points were raised.  I will begin with the points raised by Deputy Pringle.  The 2006 Act amended the 2002 Competition Act.  He is correct that it has a limiting clause.  That is a difference between competition law and unfair trading practices law.  We will always start with the consumer and that is where the object or effect clause comes in.  When examining practices that are forbidden by our legislation we always start with the question of what will be the effect on the consumer.  Practices with the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition are those that harm consumers.  Practices that affect relationships within the supply chain above that are not really the target of competition law.  In a sense that is why the issue about codes of practice and other ways of treating it has arisen so widely in Europe.  Competition authorities in general believe that their aim is to see what happens in markets and that markets operate to allow consumers to exercise choice but within the limits of regulation.<\/p> <p>That is a crucial point.  It is about exercising choice not on the basis of wrong or fraudulent information, mislabelling or anything like that, but making a decision based on accurate and comprehensive information.  The Deputy is absolutely correct in pointing out that certain of the practices the committee is concerned about may not be illegal under the 2006 Act.  <\/p><p> Deputy Pringle referred to my observation that the code of practice might not solve all the problems that exist and asked for examples of what has happened in other jurisdictions.  Deputy Pat Deering raised the question of voluntary versus statutory codes.  To give a few examples, codes of practice are in place in the United Kingdom, Lithuania, Spain, Romania, Portugal and Slovakia.  In the case of the latter, the code is set down in legislation.  In the example of our nearest neighbour a grocery code adjudicator was finally appointed in June.  The experience in that jurisdiction was that a voluntary code did not work very well.  It was reviewed several times and eventually made statutory.  There was a long debate about whether a code of practice adjudicator should be able to impose fines; in the end the legislation was amended to allow for that.  As I said, the adjudicator has just been appointed and is in the midst of consulting on practices, procedures and so on.  It is difficult to comment at this stage on the effectiveness or otherwise of that office.<\/p><p> There are different models throughout Europe.  In Lithuania, for instance, the Association of Lithuanian Trade Enterprises has voluntarily accepted a code of good business practices.  In Hungary, companies with significant market powers are required to draft a code of ethics in the domain of fair commercial practices which must be submitted to the national consumer agency for vetting.  The Spanish competition authority has issued a report on imbalances in the food supply chain and an initiative is ongoing, similar to ours, to establish a code of practice there.<\/p><p> It is very difficult to give a definitive judgment on the effectiveness of the various schemes.  The European Commission is currently examining issues in the supply chain and issues of imbalance between suppliers and retailers.  The  Directorate General for the Internal Market and Services has been working for several years on the matter of business-to-business practices.  In 2010 it set up a high-level forum to examine strategies for a better functioning food supply chain, with the aim of promoting the competitiveness of the European food industry.  The business-to-business platform was part of that, with an expert group on the competitiveness of the agrifood industry and an expert group looking at food prices.  The Commission is working on an impact assessment of the different options to assess what it calls unfair trading practices.  One of the key issues in that regard is whether codes should be voluntary or statutory and whether penalties and so on should apply.  The Commission published a Green Paper earlier in the year and issued a consultation to help gather information on the matter.<\/p><p> At the same time the Directorate General for Competition, the one with which we are most closely associated in Brussels, is of the view that unfair business-to-business practices and unfair trading practices are one issue and competition law is another.  It would be aware of some of the investigations that have been done.  For example, the competition commission in the UK did a major investigation into supermarkets and retailing.  That commission made a general finding that most of the savings the supermarkets achieved were being passed on to consumers, but it also identified what it described as an adverse impact on competition in terms of the ability of suppliers to innovate.  Suppliers, the commission found, would get to a certain stage before the pressure became such that they could no longer re-invest in their own products and so on.<\/p><p> DG Competition has commissioned a study on the retail sector which will consider such issues as the concentration of market share among a small number of players.  That is the case in Ireland but even more so in many other European countries.  In some of the Baltic states, for instance, two players have 80% of the market.  The study will also examine the effect of own brand or private label products, entry barriers, whether the bargaining power of retailers could have a negative effect on the ability of suppliers, particularly SMEs, to invest and innovate, and whether unfair commercial practices might eventually lead to unviable businesses because of the pressure on investment and innovation.  It will also consider, in cases where there are differences in the legal framework between member states - this being the Commission, there is always a concern about such differences and always a slight harmonisation agenda going on - whether that could lead to legal uncertainty for suppliers, particularly exporters.  This is very relevant to Ireland.  To sum up, there are various examples of codes of practice in jurisdictions across Europe.  By the time the Commission has done its work we will be in a better position to say exactly what works and does not work.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about compliance costs and how they might impact on businesses.  The larger retailers and larger suppliers, which include multinationals and major brand owners, have the large legal departments, back offices and resources necessary to invest in compliance, as I am sure they do.  One of the standard aspects of codes of practice generally is that they provide for a written contract or terms of business agreement, as it is was referred to in the draft code devised by John Travers in 2011.  The idea is that everything would be set down therein and variations would only be permitted where provision for such is included in the agreement.  That is important in providing a degree of certainty to suppliers and retailers.  One of the concerns about compliance is that we could have a situation where small suppliers would be summoned into the office of a retailer, given a 300-page agreement and shown where to sign.  Most small suppliers will not have the legal capability and back-up to pore over a document of that complexity to identify potential issues.  The same scenario could equally arise with smaller retailers and large multinational suppliers.  It is a two-sided thing.  The obligations might be on one party but where there is a written contract or terms of business agreement it must be scrutinised by both parties.<\/p><p> Deputy Pringle also asked whether it would be anti-competitive to set a price for a product.  The quick answer is that it depends who is setting the price.  For example, the whole idea of a co-operative is that it would set the price that is paid to the farmer for his or her product.  In fact, historically, the co-operative movement evolved in order to solve this very problem of small dispersed producers and the lack of bargaining powers they had in the food supply chain.  The revised EU regulation on the organisation of agricultural markets makes provision for producer organisations to get together, but I would not have thought there was scope, outside of that, to set the price of milk forever.  Such decisions should be part of the normal bargaining chain and there should be fluctuations in terms of supply and demand.<\/p><p> Deputy Tom Barry asked whether milk is a loss leader for retailers.  The figures would not indicate that to be the case.  Specifically, the difference between the input price of 26 cent per litre and the sale price of &euro;1.49 for 2 litres does not signify that milk is a loss leader.  It is, however, most certainly a known value item.  People know how much it costs before they go into the shop to purchase it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373982300,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I apologise, I was not very clear.  My point was that when farmers were getting 26 cent per litre the branded product was selling for &euro;1.49 for 2 litres.  However, when the price to farmers collapsed to 19 cent per litre, at a time when they were losing their shirts, the price to the consumer did not, as it should have, drop to approximately &euro;1 per 2 litres.  The multiples did not pass on that saving to consumers.  They certainly did not pay it back to distressed suppliers in a spirit of sharing the burden.  They were happy to pocket the difference, to the satisfaction of their shareholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600008#H00200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373982300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Apologies, I misunderstood the issue the Deputy was raising.  I take his point.  We would always come back with the answer that there should be greater competition at the retail level.  I noted a claim by a witness who appeared before a previous meeting of the committee that the Competition Authority had said that everything is hunky dory in the retail sector.  That is not what we said.  We observed that greater competition had caused prices to fall - this was in 2009 when there was a great deal of concern about people crossing the Border to shop and the price disparity between North and South - but we also identified many areas within the sector where there was scope for much stronger competition.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deering asked whether we would describe the grocery sector as competitive.<\/p> <p>One would not generally state that a sector which is so concentrated is particularly competitive.  One would ask how easy it is for people to enter the sector and establish themselves and for suppliers to establish other channels to market.  It seems to have become somewhat more competitive with the entry of Lidl and Aldi.  I will ask Mr. John Evans, who is a specialist in the grocery market, to comment on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373982900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>If one is basing one's assessment on the competitiveness of a sector just on market share, Dunnes Stores, Tesco and SuperValu have approximately 70% of the market and that is a strong indicator.  I suggest that the position is probably even worse than that as a result of the geographic profile of the different retailers.  SuperValu is predominantly based in rural areas, although it does have stores in urban areas.  As a result, there are between two and two and a half big players in the most urbanised areas and really only one big player covering the rural areas.  The figure of 70% probably overstates the degree of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Evans"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373982900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will move quickly on, particularly as Ms Karen O'Leary will want to address a number of the issues raised.<\/p><p>  A question was asked as to why grocery prices are higher.  Ireland is 18% above the food average for the EU 27, 12% above the average for the EU 15 and 4% above the average for the UK.  That is not good.  The price differential has decreased considerably and this is partly due to people becoming more price sensitive and shopping around.  In 2008 we were 34% above the average for the EU 27 and 62% above that for the UK.  We identified a number of reasons for the disparity and these included the cost of doing business - including energy prices, rates, etc. - and consumer incomes and tastes.  At that time there was major resistance to own-brand products and a huge adherence to established brands.  People perceived the former as somewhat inferior.  Two other reasons for the disparity were the level of competition - there certainly could be greater competition in the sector - and regulation.<\/p><p>  One of the most astonishing aspects of the issue relating to horsemeat was how many people were obtaining a cut despite the low prices being paid.  When the matter was investigated and efforts were made to trace those who had been involved in trading this product at some point, what emerged was extraordinary.  This is the reason why the NCA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland must be involved and why strict regulation is required.  There can be no rowing back in that regard.<\/p><p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien inquired about confidentiality.  In the context of the latter, there is a tension between people who want to address the committee and what can actually be done.  If we want to introduce penalties as well as a process of naming and shaming, then matters will end up in court.  This is the difficulty.  People have spoken to us in private and have been prepared to go as far as to say that certain practices have occurred.  However, when it comes to moving matters along, we need to be able to confront people with the evidence.  This has been the difficulty for us.

It has been well flagged that this is an issue about which people are becoming exercised.  Ms Goggin outlined more recent statistics which show that the differential is narrowing.  Forf&aacute;s produced a report on this matter.  The Deputy asked whether it is justified, which is a very fair question.  There are two issues which arise.  First, it has narrowed - which is good - and, second, the justification for it outlined by the industry relates to a higher cost of doing business here.  The latter has been substantiated but not to the extent of the differential.  It is narrowing and what we feel happens in markets of this nature is that there is supplier and retailer behaviour and then there is consumer behaviour.  Where the two actually interact is where one gets the end price.  Ms Goggin also referred to other matters such as resistance to the discount multiples - such as Lidl and Aldi - when they first entered the market.  Something of a stigma attached to these retailers but that has now gone away completely and most of us understand that.  Our research has shown a very big shift in consumer shopping behaviour.<\/p> <p>People are much more conscious about where they spend their money and that is a positive development.  It is one of the factors contributing to the price differential.  Another factor is that we are talking a good deal about this and people are rightly exercised about it.  Even if one accepts that the cost of doing business here is higher than in other countries, that does not explain a price differential that is above that.    <\/p><p> Deputy Deering asked about the horsemeat scandal and food labelling.  When we talk about consumer choice and value in a market, we are talking about products being what it is stated they are.  In theory, if it was indicated on the label on a packet of burgers that they contain 15% horsemeat and one was willing to pay for that product, that is fine, but that is not what consumers were told.  The inclusion of horsemeat in those products constituted fraud in terms of how this has worked out.  Even in a market that is not competitive and where there is not a concern about a race to bottom and price pressures, fraud can still be practised because more money can be made from such practices.  I would like to address the issue that it is perceived it is consumers who are driving this, but I do not believe it is.  It is bad practice that is bred in the supply chain and operators may use that argument as an excuse to do things that they should not be doing.  We would hope that it is concentrated in particular areas and is not a widespread practice.  It has focused consumers' minds on that fact that there are consequences to the way they shop and where they buy their food.  <\/p><p> Most consumers understand that even if they have to be careful in how they spend their money their shopping choices have consequences in the short and long term for the food sector and for the economic recovery of the country.  Most people do not have the luxury of paying more for a product simply because it is Irish but, all things being equal, most people would opt for that product.  <\/p><p> On the question of whether retailers should be forced  to display their profits, we believe that, on balance, it would be better if they were forced to do so.  That  may require legislative change.  Where retailers advance the argument that the cost of doing business here is higher and that is the reason they have higher prices, it is in that context that they should give that information, but if they are not making that argument, that is another ball game.  It would be useful if retailers did this in terms of debate on this area, particularly given the power they exercise.<\/p><p> Labelling is a complex area and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Shine, to speak on it.  The vast majority of food labelling is overseen by the Department's Food Safety Authority but from a consumer's perspective, people should know what they are buying.  It comes down to a question of fairness.<\/p><p> On Deputy Barry's comment on the accuracy of price promotions in terms of the money savings for customers, of the 520 complaints related to pricing that we received last year, some of those related to price offers that did not quite stack up or that were potentially misleading.  The cost per unit of a product must be displayed.  There may be varying sizes of a product as in the case of nappies or washing-up liquid, but the price per unit must be displayed.   Unfortunately, that information is not always clearly communicated.  The writing on the label can be quite small.  We tell people to make sure they check the cost per unit and that can involve a customer having to get down on their hands and knees in front of the shop shelve to check it.  The price per unit should be displayed there but where it is not we can take action.<\/p><p> On the issue of alcohol products, our normal approach when we are asked for a view on grocery issues or policy decisions is that we would give a view in terms of the consumer's choice and value.  When we were asked to comment on this issue, we very consciously said \"No\" because we felt this is not a consumer issue but a public health issue and, therefore, we would step back from that.  In that context and speaking as a parent, I would support that approach.  I will ask Mr. John Shine to speak about labelling. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600009#J03400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373983500,"counter":59,"content":"<p>As was mentioned, food labelling is a hugely complex area.

Our agency is not active in the food labelling area as there is a plethora of specific legislation covering this area  already in place, which is being enforced by the Depart of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, HSE inspectors and so on.

They realise the shortcomings and they know that it will take somebody to stand up to this.  The knowledge of the situation is making this issue much worse in reality despite however much legislation we have on this area.  As one of the witnesses said, unless somebody stands up in court, nothing will change.  It seems that particularly affects many Irish food producers who would be small operators.  Many large retailers would say that they are very pro-Irish and that they want lots of Irish products on their shelves but is that really the case?  While we seek to support and encourage customers to buy Irish and encourage indigenous food production, the moment the producers' products arrive at the retailers, those producers are hugely disadvantaged because they will not be able to compete at a level because they are not operating on an equal footing, as the witness said, with the larger food producers and will not be able to get a fair whack, so to speak.  While I appreciate the authority's dilemma regarding the legislation and the fact that people will not go to court, do the witnesses have any other offering of a solution given that this must frustrate them also?  Clearly, it  frustrates them all day, every day.  Do they have a suggestion of their own or from another country that would help us to deal with what is a very clear issue?<\/p><p>  On Ms Goggin's statement on the statutory code, I carefully read the language she used and it seems that while it is written in a fairly neutral fashion, namely, that such codes are not always fit for purpose and do not solve the problems they were intended to solve, it is quite a weighted comment, and from what I have read, I believe she is unhappy with the prospect of such a code.  Perhaps I am wrong in reading that into the statement.  She said the authority made a submission to the Department but she did not say what response it got from the Department in 2011.  While clearly she is saying that the authority will be diligent in putting this into place if it is asked to do so, I feel her heart is not in it because she does not believe in it, which is fine.  If that is the case, what would she say the authority ought to do?  She said in one of the responses that the authority will wait and see what works and what does not work from what will emerge from the Commission's work.  If she does not believe it will work, what does the authority believe will work?  That is her area of expertise, it is not mine and I do not claim to be an expert on it.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask about a consumer-related matter.<\/p> <p>How would one describe the Competition Authority's response to the horsemeat scandal?  Do the witnesses think that it was robust and strong?  If not, why not, and what lessons have been learned given that it did come as a shock?  What research has been carried out on loyalty cards, vouchers and points which seem to be a very attractive way of gathering people in?  People feel they are getting value for money and something for free.  Is it the case that it is a good thing or are we paying for that loyalty somewhere in the price?  I am sure we are but I do not know what the evidence is.<\/p><p> I appreciate the point Mr. Shine made about labelling and that it is not his area.

It was in the programme for Government.  That decision is done and dusted and it is being provided for in legislation.  If we are collectively given the job we will go for it.  It is not practicable to delay until the European Commission has necessarily done and dusted everything.  I say that because there will be more evidence at that stage about what does and does not work.  That is why we suggested the possibility of building a review period into the legislation because a year or two down the road one might have more solid evidence as to how one would get over these kinds of problems.<\/p><p>  At the time we made the submissions there was no response except that the policy subsequently comes out and is developed.  There are no individual responses to submissions because it is a public consultation to which we were submitting.  We were trying to look at ways of making it more effective and giving it teeth.  Among the suggestions we had was that if we carry out an enforcement under the 2006 Act one could apply for a declaration that a certain practice is illegal and get an injunction to stop people doing it again.  If a private company that is affected by an unfair trading practice takes a court action it can get damages.  We suggested that it be considered that double damages would be given because it would give more of an incentive for people to get over their reluctance.  No retaliatory delisting is likely to be an element of a code of practice.  As Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe said, people use language in different ways and people can describe things in different ways, so there is always a possibility that something might happen and not be identified.<\/p><p>  We looked at the possibility of limiting exposure to costs for plaintiffs in private actions.  One could imagine that for a smaller supplier going up against a much larger retailer or a small retailer taking on a large supplier the cost of a private court action could be substantial.  Another issue that has since been solved under the Competition (Amendment) Act 2011 related to the notion that if the Competition Authority took a case then someone could go straight in to seek follow-on damages without having to prove the entire case all over again.  As the lawyers say, it would be a <i>res judicata<\/i>.  At that stage the suggestions we were making were aimed at strengthening the existing legislation rather than the code of practice.  I am sorry to say I do not have a good solution to the question of confidentiality versus having teeth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600011#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373984100,"counter":72,"content":"<p>On Senator O'Keeffe&rsquo;s comment about suggestions, in 2009 when there was a consultation on the code, the National Consumer Agency made a suggestion to use similar provisions to those in the current unfair commercial practices directive, which is only consumer to business or business to consumer.  The suggestion we made was that it would be reformed in a business to business context because it gives a range of enforcement tools which are proportionate to the breaches.  That depends very much on how it works in the supply chain because when we take enforcement action, as Ms Goggin mentioned, we have a range of tools that we can use which are very powerful.  Going to court is costly and it takes time.  Where it should be done, we do it, but we must be careful about how we assign resources.  We do have some powers to enforce fines and also compliance notices.  Such instruments lead to enforcement and are not costly.  Again, we can do that on foot of complaints.  Once the two organisations are merged and assuming the combined organisation gets a role in a grocery code it is about how to enforce what we need to enforce.  I echo what Ms Goggin said, once we are merged and we have the job, it will be done to the best of our ability.  Our only concern is that it can be done well and that the intention of it can lead to the right impact.  That is what we want to see.  We did suggest that at the time because we felt that it could provide a solution.<\/p><p>  The other point that is interesting is that there is a statutory instrument relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts.  It does what it says on the tin.  It sets out that in <i>pro forma<\/i> contracts where a business gives a contract to a consumer on a take it or leave it basis there is a power imbalance.  Increasingly, consumers are assigning contracts for stuff they did not have to provide contracts for previously, for energy, financial services and telecoms.  We have the power to seek to have some of those terms overturned if, on balance, they are unfair to the consumer.  Using that in a business to business context might also require legislative change.  It would require the introduction of a new statutory instrument.  I was reminded of that when Ms Goggin referred to slapping a 300 page contract in front of someone.  I agree with her that if the code says everything must be in writing, that is fine but it does not address a big player and a small player and in fact it could make it worse for some.  The instrument that is used in order to protect consumers in that context is unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations, which do not mean that every term must be pro-consumer but it means that the totality of the contract must be fair.  It also makes provision for excessive transfer of risk or limitation of liability where the trader accepts no liability even when it should.  Those are two things that might help when we are talking about application.<\/p><p>  In response to the question on horsemeat, two things are important to understand.  The legislation we apply is horizontal as Mr. Shine said.  What that means is it applies to every sector and every practice where it is a business to consumer.  It is quite broad and it is an instrument that can be very powerful in certain situations and in other situations it is not as suitable.  In a lot of sectors there is sector-specific legislation.  Financial services is a big one where the Central Bank has a sectoral role in consumer protection.  Another area is telecoms where ComReg has a certain element of consumer protection within its overall mandate and also as an energy regulator.  The consumer is at the top and one has sectoral regulators.  There are some rules that are specific to food and they are better dealt with under the sectoral regulator.<\/p> <p>What we do not want to do is bump into each other while trampling over the same problem.  That is not a good use of State resources.  I can tell the committee that the acting chief executive at the time - I had not been appointed - wrote to the chief executive of the Food Standards Authority of Ireland, FSAI, offering assistance and asking if there was anything it could do or if there were issues better dealt with under the Consumer Protection Act.<\/p><p> In terms of lessons learned, we genuinely asked what we can do but we came to the view that the FSAI was all over it, so to speak, that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the FSAI had more power than we could apply, that the Consumer Protection Act, CPA, would not help, and that we would get in the way.  We offered assistance and said that if breaches were found with regard to which the CPA would be a better instrument they should call us and we will come in.<\/p><p> On the overall issue, I agree it is a consumer issue but we believe that any agency or organisation, including Government policy, has to have consumers represented on it also.  We do not have a monopoly on it, so to speak.<\/p><p> Regarding loyalty schemes and points, we have not done specific research on consumer attitudes to loyalty schemes.  In terms of consumer behaviour - members should take surveys with a caveat - a friend of mine who has a set of keys has a loyalty card from almost everyone who offers them but it is a loyalty with no loyalty, so to speak.  Consumers perceive they are getting something for it but the question is whether they are simply paying more and getting it back in another way.  There is an element of that, but we have not done research into that specific issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600011#L01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373984700,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Will the agency do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600012#M00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373984700,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Absolutely, we will consider that.

There is a difference between an Irish product and an Irish brand.  For instance, we have several brands of Irish tea but we do not grow tea in this country.  It is a question of what is Irish, and it very much depends on the claim being made about the product.  Potentially that is something that would be covered by the Consumer Protection Act but we will be examining the extent to which consumers are being misled regarding the claims being made about the product as distinct from the brand ownership.  In theory it is an issue the Consumer Protection Act could examine.  It is not an area about which we get many complaints.  Off the top of my head, the complaints we had in recent years related to other products.  For instance, we had an issue in the past regarding hand-knitted Aran jumpers that apparently were being hand-knitted in China.  We would examine issues like that but it very much depends on the circumstances.

That is one issue.<\/p><p>  Regarding our lines on imports, there was a feeling in the tillage industry, which is minor but important and in which I am involved, that if there was enough water in Cork Port, Foynes or any other port we did not need a tillage industry because all the product could come from overseas.  That was the view until last year when we found ourselves in the midst of a fodder crisis.  For many people in the centre of Dublin a fodder crisis would have only hit home when the dog nuts were not available in the multiples.  However, for those of us living in the rural areas it was incredibly important.  We need to protect our native industries, which is not being done.  <\/p><p>  A tipping point will be reached here because food prices may get very high if we do not protect our fragile food industry.  It is fragile because in a sense our agriculture industry has held back a rise in inflation for almost 20 years.  When I got out of milk production almost 20 years ago the price of a litre of milk was 26 or 27 pence a litre or &pound;1 a gallon.  It was still close to that price a while ago.  We cannot continue to absorb those costs.  When this correction is made it will be sudden and painful, and the consumer will pay for it.  Unfortunately, they will not thank us for our inaction at this time.<\/p><p>  Does Mr. Kenny believe there is a place for a legal support agency for small and medium enterprises that do not have the resources for these huge contract documents about which he spoke?  I have come across that in my business.  It is frightening when one has to sit across a team of perhaps six or seven people all of whom are experts in their own areas, they hand one a document and one is wondering what to do with it.  It is another area we need to examine.  I ask Mr. Kenny for his opinions on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600012#M01100","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1373984700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The first question was directed at Mr. Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600012#M01200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373984700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The policy of the authority has been not to confirm or say anything about operations that have not been confirmed by the parties involved.

To an extent, what I am going to say is related to the fact that some of these issues are being examined on a Europe-wide industry level.  I appreciate what has been said but it is important to remember that the Germans, French, Danish and everybody else have the same instinct to protect their native industries.  Given the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, competition law has an important role to play in keeping markets open for our exports.  At the end of the day, we are a small exporting nation and we need access to markets.<\/p><p>    Some things could be of concern regarding one of our large export markets.  If one has a capacity for a lot of co-ordination at producer level, which is provided for in the milk package, one can get a small number of very big groups of producers at that level.  There are fairly rigid codes of practice tying those producers to retailers and one has a very concentrated retail sector.  It is concentrated here but it tends to be concentrated elsewhere as well.  In Germany, four retailers have 85% of the market.  In Sweden, three retailers have 80% while in Denmark there are three retailers with 90%.<\/p><p>  If there is a common European-wide system of regulation, it is important that we should be able to get in there as well.  I am not saying that we should throw the Irish consumer off the sledge, but it is important that our producers can also get access to retailers in other countries.  The system should not be tied up unnecessarily by long-term contracts.<\/p><p>  A legal support agency for SMEs was mentioned, but I have never thought about it.  It is an interesting idea and we would like to go away and think about it.  <\/p><p>  As regards monitoring sectors, we have interaction with sectors on an ongoing basis but we do not have a systematic way of sitting down and talking to people.  I think the Deputy was talking about putting moral pressure on them, but it is difficult to do that when one has an enforcement side going on.  We tend to do one big study every so often.  In 2009, it was groceries, while at the moment we are looking at ports which is obviously an important input cost both for imports and exports.  We are hoping to report on that by the end of the year.  <\/p><p>  We are happy about our resource situation at the moment.  Between 2007 and 2011 we lost a lot of people when our staff numbers went down.  Thankfully, however, we were given sanction to recruit ten extra people, which was great.  They are all on board now.<\/p><p>  We tend to examine one sector at a time.  We can of course consider re-examining the grocery sector but at the moment our interaction with it would be in terms of advocacy.  The kinds of things we are doing now include the code of practice and ongoing enforcement issues which we cannot discuss.  Mergers also arise all the time and there has been quite a bit of activity on that over the last while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600013#N02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373985300,"counter":116,"content":"<p>As regards Senator O'Keeffe's question, I will give some history on the compliance blitz.  The National Consumer Agency was established in 2007 and took over functions from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, plus a host of other new functions given to it by the Consumer Protection Act.  At the time, there was a constant on-the-road inspectorate, which was thought to be inefficient and had less managerial oversight than it could have had.  I cannot take any credit for this because I was not there.  It was pulled back and we thought we needed to ensure two main objectives.  First, it is important for traders to know that we are out there so they are aware that they will get a visit at some stage.  Second, consumers must have confidence in their spending.  Obviously, consumer confidence in spending matters for recovery.<\/p> <p>Compliance allows us to focus on price display legislation.  If prices are not displayed, it is a breach of the legislation.  Another provision is the misleading indication of a price where the price at the till is higher than the price on the shelf about which people, rightly, get annoyed.<\/p><p> We will get complaints about pricing.  Last year, there were 520 complaints made.  We will then send a follow-up letter or telephone call asking what has happened to the store.  Depending on how they deal with us or if they have come up on our system before, we would list them for a visit.  We marry the level of complaints with location and with various retail sectors.  Most of our visits are to grocery retailers because they have more items on sale.  It is a mixture of the large retailers and smaller ones.<\/p><p> As to how many we pick, it is a risk-based approach.  There is also an element of geographical spread.  Even if we have not had any calls from Donegal, we will visit there and make sure our presence is known.<\/p><p> The main constraint to our work is staffing.  Ten years ago, consumer compliance would have been focused on pricing alone.  Our job now is still that, plus product safety legislation.  We have 21 people working in the division, of which 40% are focused on product safety because it is an important area.  When the NCA, National Consumer Agency, was originally established it was supposed to have 80 staff as approved by the Department of Finance.  However, that was in 2007 and now everything has changed.  We got caught by the recruitment moratorium.  When we opened our doors in 2007, we had 67 people.  Now, we have 37.<\/p><p> We are not complaining.  The world has changed.  Businesses are operating with less and consumers are spending less.  We fully appreciate that there were efficiencies and reforms we could implement to make the agency better.  We try to be as clever as we can with the assignment of our resources.  However, if we had more staff, we could be out there more.  Increasingly, we have noted it is not about what has happened on the shop floor but the contract or online.  The latter is becoming increasingly important as the agency is responsible for the e-commerce directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600013#N02600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373985900,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.  It is appropriate the two agencies were the ones that concluded our hearings on the code of conduct for the grocery sector.  They are both involved in protecting the public interest.  This has got a European dimension to it now as there has been a response by retailers for a voluntary code at European level.<\/p><p>  There are still concerns that voluntary will not work.  It seems odd that we accept Fair Trade products benefit the supplier from a less developed country, as well as the consumer.  Why can we not adopt the same approach of fair trade for the domestic producer?  Waters have been muddied by claims that a code will be expensive.  Arrangements, however, can be put in place for dominant players and smaller suppliers.  Retail Excellence Ireland stated smaller retailers are at the behest of the dominant large suppliers.<\/p><p>  While the principle is simple, greed is getting in the way.  Margins are being taken by some involved who pretend they have the best interests of the consumer at heart when it is at someone else&rsquo;s expense.  I know of cases of retailers telling processors what their product will cost.  At all times the margin is kept by the retailer.  This is not addressed by the legislation in place.  It is not in the best interest of the consumer.  Deputy Tom Barry highlighted the case that when milk prices for farmers fell through the floor, the same high prices were maintained in the shops.  There is a milk price war going on.  Another dimension to it is that much of the product is being sourced north of the Border.  The concern is that Ireland may be left without a secure supply of fresh milk.  Considering we export it, there is a certain irony in that.<\/p><p>  On foot of these meetings, we will establish a small working group of committee members to prepare a report and, hopefully, publish it by the end of September.

However, we can lay bare the facts of pricing despite the gloss that is put on the issue at times.  We are not trying to score points with these hearings, just to expose the facts.  We are trying to protect the consumer, the processor and the primary producer at all stages.  It is called fair trade and fair play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071600014#O00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373985900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 July 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","time":1373977800,"counter":120},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 13:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Dara Calleary, Senator Deirdre Clune, Deputy \u00c1ine Collins, Senator David Cullinane, Deputy Michael Conaghan, Senator John Kelly, Deputy Se\u00e1n Kyne, Senator Mary White.

I am joined here today by my colleagues, Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, corporate services, EU affairs and trade policy; Mr. Tommy Murray, principal officer, EU affairs and internal market; Mr. Gerry Monks, principal officer, trade policy unit; Mr. Pat Kelly, assistant principal officer, Office of Science and Technology; and Mr. Paul Cullen, principal officer, labour affairs unit.<\/p><p>  I want to acknowledge and comment on the Department's significant contribution to the recent successful EU Presidency.  I thank the Chairman for his remarks on behalf of the committee and I would be happy to convey those back to the staff.  There were a number of notable achievements under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the jobs, enterprise, trade, competitiveness and innovation area.  Chief among these, for example, was the consensus by EU Trade Ministers on the mandate to enable the Commission to begin talks on an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership, the agreement on the new &euro;70 billion research and development programme, known as Horizon 2020, the agreement on the accounting directive, the signing of the agreement on a Unified Patent Court by 25 participating member states, as well as the agreement on the Commission's new state aid modernisation proposals.<\/p> <p>I will come back to these and the other important Presidency outcomes in more detail but suffice to say that, overall, the Irish Presidency has delivered significant long-term policy objectives and concluded agreements on numerous decisions which will be vital for Europe's future.  We should be proud of the reputational benefits flowing from what has been an efficient, effective and value-added Presidency for Ireland and Europe.  I have set out in an appendix, for the information of the committee, a comprehensive note  on the Department's outcomes and achievements.<\/p><p> Turning to the six-monthly report for the period July 2012 to December 2012, which covered the period of the Cypriot Presidency, I will focus first on the key legislative and policy developments that occurred in the various EU Council formations during that six-month period.  The report covers three Councils that fall within the remit of the Department, the Competitiveness Council, the Employment Social Policy, Health and the Consumer Affairs Council, usually referred to as EPSCO, and the Trade Council.  In relation to matters under the EPSCO Council, while the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is the lead co-ordinator, it should be noted that the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills take the lead responsibility for matters in their respective social, youth and skills policy areas covered under this Council.  Furthermore, it is important to note that the Competitiveness Council has a broad cross-cutting remit, which covers the Internal Market, industry, research and space areas.  While the Department takes the lead on this Council, given the wide range of sectoral issues involved, a significant number of files fall under the remit of other Departments.  During the period of this report the Council met on three occasions, twice formally, under the Cypriot Presidency.  A number of the dossiers discussed at the Councils during the period under review are ongoing while many were finalised during our term of the EU Presidency.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the specific areas.  Under the Competitiveness Council, Single Market Act I and Single Market Act II,<b><\/b>the October Council examined the state of play of the 12 measures contained in Single Market Act I and held a debate on the way forward.  Ministers also welcomed the second wave of the new 12 priority proposals presented by the Commission under the Single Market Act II and Council conclusions were adopted.<b><\/b>On the issue of consumer protection, the Cypriot Presidency successfully concluded discussions with the European Parliament on the proposals relating to alternative dispute resolution and online dispute resolution.  The Cypriot Presidency provided for an exchange of views on European industrial policy and its contribution to growth and economic recovery at the October Council.  Measures in support of the construction sector and the cultural and creative sectors were also considered.  In addition, Council conclusions were adopted on key enabling technologies.  Following significant progress under the Cypriot Presidency, broad agreement on the patents package was secured at the December Council.  The December Council held a debate on the three proposals contained in the package on the modernisation of public procurement policy.  Agreement on a general approach was reached on all three proposals.  In relation to professional qualifications, note was taken at the December Council of a report drawn up by the Presidency on the progress made regarding a draft directive aimed at making the system of recognition of professional qualifications more efficient.  Also, at the December Council delegations noted the progress made on the review and simplification of the accounting rules applicable to EU companies.  An exchange of views at the December Council on the future of state aid policy from the point of view of industry resulted in delegations agreeing on the need to modernise state aid policy by setting objectives that support growth, employment and EU competitiveness.  A resolution approving the launch of an EU customs action plan to combat the intellectual property rights infringements for the period 2013 to 2017 was adopted at the December Council.  A public debate on the Commission proposal for a modernised Union customs code also took place with a view to facilitating a first-reading agreement with the European Parliament.<\/p><p> Turning to the Competitiveness Council, research and development Ministers, and space issues, in October, the Council agreed on the main elements of the rules of participation in projects funded under Horizon 2020, which is the next research and innovation framework programme for the years 2014 to 2020.  It also agreed on the arrangements for incorporating the European Institute of Innovation and Technology within the Horizon 2020 programme.  The Council held a policy debate on the next steps towards the completion and implementation of the European research area.  At the December Council Vice President Tajani presented the EU-European Space Agency communication to the Council and also informed Ministers that the space industry package would be adopted in January 2013.<\/p><p> Turning to the EPSCO Council, the Council held an exchange of views on economic governance in the field of employment and social policy within the framework of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.  In October 2012, EPSCO Ministers agreed a general approach on the electromagnetic magnetic fields file.  An orientation discussion on the enforcement of the posting of workers directive took place at the December Council.  The proposals on the quotas for women on boards were presented to the Council.  The Council was also briefed on difficulties that had arisen in negotiations with the European Parliament on negotiations for a programme for social change and innovation.<\/p><p> Turning to the Trade Council, there was one Trade Council held during the Cypriot Presidency on 29 November. The main trade achievement was the agreement of Ministers on an EU-Japan free trade agreement negotiating mandate.  In addition, the Cypriot Presidency oversaw the conclusion of EU free trade agreement negotiations with Singapore and progress on FTA negotiations with Canada, Vietnam, India, and the southern and eastern neighbourhood countries.  A decision was made to enter into negotiations to conclude a comprehensive and deep free trade area with Morocco, within the context of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.<\/p><p> Turning to Ireland's Presidency from January to June of this year, my Department played a central role in driving the EU policy agenda embodied in the overarching policy theme of &quot;promoting sustainable economic growth and jobs and building Europe's competitive advantage&quot;.   In its Presidency Ireland focused on measures to promote growth and employment in accordance with the compact for growth and jobs as agreed by Heads of State and Government in June 2012.  The Presidency placed a strong emphasis on advancing proposals that can boost the EU's competitive edge globally and add greatest value to jobs, growth, competitiveness and investment.  Within the various Council formations chaired by Ministers and officials of the Department, we also succeeded in attaining agreements on all of the significant funding programmes under the EU's budget, the multi-annual financial framework for 2014 to 2020.  To start with the Trade Council, as I indicated earlier, I supplied the committee with a note of some of the Department's achievements and therefore I will lightly touch on some of the key highlights.  Under our Presidency, we attached great importance to promoting the EU's external trade agenda for the benefit of Irish companies and for the wider EU economy and its exporters.  Trade is essential to job creation; 30 million jobs or 10% of the EU workforce depend on exports.  In June, we reached agreement among EU trade Ministers on the mandate in order for the Commission to start talks on an EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Reaching agreement among EU trade Ministers on the terms of the EU's negotiating mandate was a top priority for the Irish Presidency and I am happy to say that the trade negotiations commenced last week in Washington.<\/p><p> According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership between the US and the EU could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU.  Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800 million per annum in increased GDP, and 4000 new jobs.<\/p><p> Turning to Horizon 2020 which comes under the Research Council, on the agreement on the new &euro;70 billion research and development programme, Horizon 2020, Ireland argued strongly, and successfully, in favour of a greater emphasis on the SME sector.  In addition to new specific supports, such as access to finance and debt and equity facilities, for SMEs, it has now been agreed that the target for SME participation in relevant areas of Horizon 2020 should be increased from 15% to 20%.  This is a significant change given the proposed scale of Horizon 2020.  The programme will use a simplified funding model which means that a greater number of businesses and research providers - small, medium and large - can access the programme with less bureaucracy.  In line with the action plan for jobs, we will pursue funding and other opportunities under EU Horizon 2020 programme for specific sectoral activities of national importance and in line with our national research priorities.<\/p><p> Turning to the Competitiveness Council, furthermore, agreement was also achieved on the &euro;2 billion dedicated programme for competitiveness and SMEs which is known as the COSME programme, which will provide targeted financial support for SMEs.  In particular, the proposed equity facility for growth-phase investment will support the development of the EU-wide venture capital market, as well as the loan facility which will provide direct or other risk sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans for SMEs.<\/p> <p> Regarding smart regulation, which falls under the Competitiveness Council, we worked with member states and the European Commission to agree an approach for the medium term whereby all European regulation would be assessed so as to remove unnecessary costs for business and all end users.  Council conclusions on smart regulation in response to two communications from the Commission were approved by the Competitiveness Council on 29 May, setting out the next steps for the simplification of EU regulation.  The conclusions focused largely on the manner in which outputs would be delivered by the Commission from its various overlapping programmes.<\/p><p> In light of the adoption by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council of Ministers of a recommendation on an EU-wide youth guarantee, the Department is continuing to support the Department of Social Protection in improving its services to unemployed young people with a particular focus on optimising the benefits of the guarantee for Ireland.  The agreement reached by EPSCO Ministers in Brussels in February recommended that member governments should move quickly to implement youth guarantees in their respective countries, taking into account existing national, regional and local policies and objectives.  At EU level, our Presidency had pushed strongly for early production of implementation plans in all member states.<\/p><p> Arising from this agreement, the European Council has approved a youth employment initiative amounting to &euro;6 billion for the period 2014-20 to support measures aimed at addressing youth unemployment and, in particular, to support the youth guarantee for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment.  The June 2013 European Council decided that member states seeking to benefit from the youth employment initiative should adopt a plan to tackle youth unemployment, including through the implementation of the youth guarantee before the end of 2013.  Most funding of measures required to implement a youth guarantee will none the less need to come from the national budget.<\/p><p> The European semester process was greatly improved this year under the stewardship of our Presidency.  The Presidency obtained Council agreement on Council conclusions on the Commission's Annual Growth Survey 2013 as well as adoption of the 2013 joint employment report and a decision approving the guidelines for the employment policies of member states for 2013. The majority of member states supported the country-specific recommendations addressed to them on employment and social policy issues.<\/p><p> Proposals on state aid modernisation were also agreed.  These new state aid regulations will take account of post-crisis structural reforms and industrial restructuring that member states are undergoing as well as the need for better alignment of state aid with Europe 2020 objectives.<\/p><p> A number of important files that were vital to completing and integrating the EU Single Market were also agreed or significantly advanced, including those on recognition of professional qualifications, public procurement and the accounting directive.  With the agreement on these files, some long-standing barriers to completing and integrating the Internal Market have been removed, making it easier to move and work across all member states and lowering transaction costs for SMEs.  The accounting directive will provide for transparency on revenue streams that governments in resource-rich countries around the world are receiving from European companies active in these industries and in the logging of primary forests.  The directive is also important, in that it updates the EU's accounting legislation, improves transparency and reduces red tape.<\/p><p> The signing of an international agreement on a unified patent court by 25 participating member states during the Competitiveness Council on 19 February provides the impetus for creating a genuine Internal Market for those seeking to protect and enforce their patent rights at European level.  It has been estimated that users of the unified patent court could save between &euro;148 million and &euro;289 million per year, given the present cost of such litigations of approximately &euro;1.5 million in some member states.  The figure of &euro;289 million refers to individual patent cases.<\/p><p> Given the diverse range of dossiers covered by each of the Councils, it is only possible to provide a summary overview on the main legislative and policy developments covered by the six-monthly report.  The note on the Presidency, which I have also submitted to the committee, provides a more comprehensive debrief on Presidency outcomes and achievements.  During our Presidency, we worked hard to progress these key dossiers with a view to advancing and contributing to a pro-growth and pro-employment agenda across Europe.  I will be happy to respond to questions or observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373978700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.

I also compliment the Secretary General on his report.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise specific issues.  The youth guarantee may be the most important legacy of our Presidency.  Mr. Murphy mentioned that most of the resources would need to come from national budgets.  What is the EU bringing to the equation?  What will his Department's role be?  He stated that rolling out the guarantee is for the Department of Social Protection, but what responsibility will his Department have in that roll-out?<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Murphy confirm that we will need a referendum in respect of the unitary patent system?  Has there been any discussion of when that referendum will be held?  My understanding is that the referendum is ready, but I have heard no word of it being included among the forthcoming referendums in the autumn.  If so many benefits are to arise from the system, one would assume that the Department would be anxious to move to a referendum as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  Mr. Murphy's comments on public procurement were made in the context of removing blockages in the Single Market.  From this committee, Deputy Lawlor and others, Mr. Murphy will know that our concern about public procurement relates to the manner in which it is being rolled out in Ireland, particularly by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as an anti-Irish SME programme.  Tenders are rolled out in large blocks and Irish SMEs are not given the chance to get involved, losing them job creation opportunities.  Will the developments make it easier for Irish companies to access public procurement, thereby maintaining or creating jobs in Ireland?<\/p><p>  Horizon 2020 and the Programme for the Competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs, COSME, are welcome.  We have one year of influence left in terms of Horizon 2020, given Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn's presence.  What plans does the Department have in place to tie down some specifics?  A great deal of work is under way in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the Department's science wing.  Some good announcements have been made.<\/p><p>  We raised the issue of state aid modernisation with the Minister via parliamentary questions last week.  The activity in what are called \"C\" regions will have a particular impact on Ireland.  Will Mr. Murphy confirm for the record what this will mean?  A great deal of work was done by the Department and the Minister to bring Commissioner Almunia down from the cliff again, given his initial proposals.  Will the modernisation have implications for the way in which the IDA engages in its operations?  It will not kick in until this time next year, but one assumes that the IDA is in preparation mode.<\/p><p>  The Minister has set up a group of what he called seven dynamic people in the sector to advise on the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan.  Will their work feed into our contribution to the 2020 action plan?  In light of the work done by the Cypriot Presidency on the proposal for quotas for women on boards, I wish to point out that only one woman was appointed to the group of seven.  Will Mr. Murphy outline the quota proposals agreed under the Cypriot Presidency and highlighted by him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600005#D00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373978700,"counter":133,"content":"<p>On the youth guarantee, the EU brings a total of &euro;6 billion in additional funding to the table, of which &euro;3 billion will be specific to a youth employment initiative.  A further &euro;3 billion will be added to the European Social Fund, ESF, budget.  The second part of the &euro;6 billion must be matched nationally at a 50:50 rate.<\/p> <p>That sounds like a large amount of money but it is not when one considers the number of unemployed young people across the European Union.<\/p><p> There is a reference in the youth guarantee that it will focus on the regions where youth unemployment is particularly high and Ireland would qualify.  A number of member states in the European Union have significantly higher rates of youth unemployment, particularly Spain and Italy.  As I said earlier, the Department of Social Protection plays the lead role and the Department of Education and Skills plays a significant role when one examines the full range of policies and measures that address further training and education for young people.  In the context of the youth guarantee that means people aged between 18 and 25 and there is quite a range of policies involved.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs also plays a role.  My Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation also has a role and works closely with those Departments.  It tries to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that there is a role for enterprise whether in traineeship programmes or any other initiatives that might be rolled out.  We are anxious to ensure that we get industry and enterprise generally actively involved in these programmes.<\/p><p>   I do not know the precise timescale for this initiative but there is work under way between interdepartmental groups.  I expect that the Minister for Social Protection will want to return the matter to Government in the autumn.  I expect that the Cabinet committee system will be used.  If so, it would enable us to adopt the programme which needs to be adopted by the end of the year and would mean that we could maximise and draw down funds.  <\/p><p> Another important dimension of the youth guarantee is that it is frontloaded for 2014 and 2015.  Is that right Mr. Cullen?  Does wish to add anything on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373979300,"counter":135,"content":"<p>No, just to confirm that frontloading means that the bulk of the funds will be expended in 2014 and 2015.

If we are transferring sovereignty from the Irish courts to an international court then it is not an EU institution and, therefore, is not covered by Article 29 of the Constitution that provides for certain things to be done under the EU rubric.  Work needs to be done on the specification for the court and so on and it would be necessary to have that done before a referendum is held.<\/p><p>  As the committee will know, there are a number of possible referendums, including one that we are certain of this September.  The unified patent court referendum is likely to take place in the latter half of 2014.  Such timing would allow for the degree of certainty that one needs to operate the court.  It would also enable the Government to take a number of decisions that are relevant to the court before the overall matter of the jurisdiction is put to a referendum.  <\/p><p>  We have discussed public procurement issues before.  Deputy Calleary mentioned that the public procurement policy is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recently it appointed a new chief procurement officer.  As I have mentioned here before, there are conflicting policy objectives.  There is definitely a need to ensure we have efficiency in public procurement which often means a focus on saving money, economies of scale, etc.<\/p><p>  The other policy objective that we particularly focus on is ensuring there is as much openness to SMEs and Irish firms as possible in the public procurement market.  We are often quoted statistics to the effect that a very high percentage of public procurement contracts go to Irish firms, most of which are SMEs, certainly if one uses the European definition.  On the other hand, there is a fair bit of anecdotal evidence on particular types of tenders and people feel that the conditions of the tender exclude them.<\/p><p>  The focus of our interaction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been on ways to get better SME involvement.  Let me give an example.  We examine restrictive clauses in public procurement tenders to do with insurance bonds, for example, and things like that.  If the clauses are set at too high a level firms can be excluded.  We also focus on facilitating SMEs in order for them to come forward with innovative solutions rather than over specify what needs to be provided.  We try to encourage people to come forward with solutions.  We have worked with Enterprise Ireland and a range of actors in the public sector to advance that agenda and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>  The public procurement directives relevant to this discussion were about simplifying administrative procedures and facilitating the use of e-procurement.  The EU spends approximately &euro;2 trillion per annum on public procurement which is a huge amount of money and about 19% of EU GDP.  If we are serious about opening up the Single Market then there are significant opportunities in procurement.  We work closely with Enterprise Ireland, for example, and help companies to internationalise, identify and avail of opportunities.  Turnover requirements have been explicitly limited to twice the size of a contract.  Therefore, one should not set very high levels of turnover that SMEs cannot meet, it is possible to divide contracts into smaller lots and there will be detailed monitoring by the Commission on SME participation.<\/p><p>  I understand Deputy Calleary referred to the Commission's definition of SMEs.  Is that less than 500 or 250 employees?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373979300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Fewer than 250 employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tommy Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373979300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>It is 250 employees or fewer.

There is a lot of work going on.  We have focused, in particular, on certain critical administrative aspects of Horizon 2020 that could act as a barrier to participation in smaller countries like Ireland.  Some member states favoured a more complex set of arrangements for funding that would benefit large research institutions at the expense of smaller ones and make funding more difficult.  Let us say one tries to put together a consortium comprising a number of institutes.  In that case we would be anxious to ensure that the funding arrangements are as straightforward as possible to better facilitate smaller member states, Ireland in particular.  There is a lot of work being done.  First, we must maximise our potential for funding under the existing programme that has not finished yet.  Second, we want to be ready to hit the ground running when Horizon 2020 comes on stream.<\/p><p>  I shall respond to the question about state aid modernisation.  Aid in the \"C\" regions is extremely important to several member states, including Ireland.  There are two critical issues.  First, will aid be available.  Second, if so is it only available for new products or enterprises.  A significant part of IDA Ireland's work is to retain, build and help existing multinationals to change their product plans or processes and so on in order to stay ahead of the competition.  Therefore, it was important to get some modifications to facilitate aid for existing enterprises provided it was for new products or processes.  We have achieved significant success in that regard.  Where an issue arises IDA Ireland will have to ensure that it can work with people to develop their proposals in a way that meets requirements.<\/p><p>  Finally, an entrepreneurship strategy was mentioned.  We are developing an entrepreneurship strategy at present.<\/p> <p>We know the rate at which new businesses start up is critical to economic recovery.  We know, for example, that the bulk of new employment comes in the first five years of the life of an enterprise and that after that it tends to go into more steady state environment unless it happens to be in a rapidly growing sector.  The first five years is critical to the creation of employment in the bulk of companies.<\/p><p> We need to increase the rate of start-up and to ensure we have the right mix of policies and measures in place to facilitate that.  There is work being done on a national strategy at present.  In that context, the EU's proposals on women serving on boards was mentioned and also that the Minister had appointed a group recently.  These are two different issues.  We were conscious in developing the action plan for jobs 2013 of the need to do more in the area of female entrepreneurship and we included some specific measures in that regard, on which Enterprise Ireland is working.  The proposal coming from the EU on quotas for women serving on boards refers to major companies, PLCs.  There is division among member states on this.  We have had a policy of trying to achieve a 40% quota on State boards, which is quite difficult to implement as I am sure Deputy Calleary will recall from his time as a Minister of State.  It has not been easy in recent years to find people generally who want to serve on State boards but it is difficult to find women in particular, especially in the enterprise sector.  A number of member states objected to this on subsidiarity grounds, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, countries that would normally be regarded as relatively progressive on matters of social policy and so on, but it is interesting that on this particular proposal there was significant opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373979900,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the Secretary General and his team.  Again I too commend them on their role during the Presidency.<\/p><p>  The overarching theme of the presentation is to promote sustainable economic growth and jobs.  We all accept that and want to see it realised.  There is an obvious relationship between economic growth and job creation.  If we are to reach the very modest job creation targets which the Department has set, we must see improved growth figures in this State and across Europe.  My view is that economic growth has not been great in Europe in the past six months.  It certainly has not been great in this State.  I met the troika on behalf of my party when they were in town last week.  It was of the view that the figures for the first quarter of this year and the early indications of the first half of this year were negative.  That creates a problem.  If we are not achieving real sustainable economic growth, it is unlikely we will reach job creation targets.  That is important.  While growth is the overarching objective, the reality in Europe unfortunately is different.<\/p><p>  In regard to Horizon 2020, my understanding is that the State's overall target for spending was 3% of GDP.  Are we reaching that percentage?  What percentage are we currently achieving?  The Secretary General also referred to Horizon 2020 and that SME participation in relevant areas should be increased from 15% to 20%.  What are we achieving at present?  We need to have the baseline figures so that we can benchmark them against the objectives.  Are we realising our targets?  I believe we should support the small and medium sized enterprises in the area of research and development and accessing EU and global markets.  Much work remains to be done in that area.  If we are to set targets, we need to have a sense of the present position.<\/p><p>  The proposed equity facility for growth phase investment was referred to in the opening statement.  Will this equity facility be over or below the interest rate of current bank lending?  We had a problem with the micro-enterprise loan fund.  Unfortunately, the take-up rate in some regions was low.  From the discussions I had with the enterprise boards across the south east region, among the issue raised was that the scheme was not attractive enough as the interest rates were too high.  We need to get that right.  If we are to introduce schemes designed to help SMEs, they must be attractive and relevant and the take up rate among SMEs should be at a proper level so that they avail of the supports being given to them.<\/p><p>  The youth guarantee is one of the major achievements of the Presidency but we need to see it rolled out and add value not only in regard to training and education but job opportunities for people.  There is a tendency for us to fall back on education and training when the jobs are not there but our focus must be on jobs.  If the youth guarantee is rolled out have we any indication of the time frame for people getting a job and having a genuine career pathway when they participate in a youth guarantee scheme?  I am sure the Secretary General will be aware that this committee published a substantial report on the youth guarantee, as did the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Have the officials studied that report and considered the raft of recommendation we would have made which would underpin the Department's approach to rolling out its programme?<\/p><p>  Is there greater scope for state aid for manufacturing industries?  A related issue is regional aid.  I am aware that the maps and guidelines for regional aid are being re-examined.  I am from the south east and I make no apologies for continuously raising the fact that the region is under performing with high unemployment levels.  When I look at the regional aid guidelines, the south east as a sub-region should be on a par with the BMW region.  Is that being considered?<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the gender imbalance of the delegation, there is a need to do more in terms of women entrepreneurs and do what we can to help and assist them, especially  we need to look at intervention and supports at the early level.  We need strategies to target young people.<\/p><p>  My final point - I made this point to the Minister when he has appeared before the committee - is that the Department must work in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills to look at second and third level education and to foster a spirit of creativity and innovation.  While we are all going for the immediate wins, we need to focus on the long term so as to ensure there is a generation of young people who are geared to innovation and creativity.  There is a role for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise  and Innovation to work with the Department of Education and Skills on this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600007#F00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373979900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issue of gender balance in the Department.

The 40% representation of women is met, but that is not the composition of the delegation today.<\/p><p>  On the targets of the different percentages of GDP, there are a number of different targets for research and development.  The goal we set for the Europe 2020 strategy is to improve the conditions for research and development with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP, which is about 2% of GDP by 2020.  Our national reform programme of 2012 indicates that underlying assumption remains valid and that progress is on track.

The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2011 is estimated at 2.2% of GNP, approximately 1.8% of GDP.  Achievement of our research and development target under Europe 2020 will require continuing government funding and supportive measures, as indicated in the national reform programme, to support the research and development base.<\/p><p> We would have set an outside target of the order of &euro;600 million out of FP7 - the seventh EU framework programme for research and technological development - the existing programme that expires at the end of this year and would already have achieved over &euro;500 of that.  The latest figure I have is from earlier this year and I am very confident we will achieve the target by the end of this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373980500,"counter":149,"content":"<p>This is an EU initiative and it was to be 3% of GDP.

This is not something that will be done in isolation from other measures that are being developed by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  Significant work is being done under the Pathways to Work programme, which operates to complement what we are doing in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Reform and restructuring of employment services is taking place through Intreo and a particular objective is to get better linkages between persons on the live register, employers and other opportunities.<\/p><p>  The intention of the youth guarantee is that it will build on existing measures, including the full range of activation measures in other schemes, to offer eligible categories of education, training or employment.  Significant work is also being done by the Department of Education and Skills in developing SOLAS, the further education and training authority.  The legislation for this was passed recently.  I am going from this meeting to a meeting between the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Education and Skills, where we will look at the strategy that will be developed for SOLAS and the role we envisage for employers so that they are brought into it.  Members may have seen, for example, that when JobsPlus was being launched, it was important that we had employers involved.  In the south east we had an interesting example of this.  There, a new company developed an important programme, in partnership between the employer and F&Aacute;S, to retrain people who had lost their jobs in TalkTalk.  This is the kind of programme we want to consider, along with other initiatives, so that when we are building a range of measures under the youth guarantee, we can ensure enterprise is plugged into that and the programme does not just become a course with nothing following on from it.<\/p><p>  With regard to state aid and the regional aid maps, coverage is a significant issue.  We have managed to retain and slightly increase the proportion of Ireland's population that can be covered under regional aid maps.  The percentage covered will increase to approximately 51.4% of the population.  This is only a marginal increase, but we had faced a potential reduction at one stage.  It is important to avoid a reduction.  State aid is a matter that must be considered and it is a matter for Government to decide on it in due course.  I have no doubt every region in the country will make its case, including the south east.

We have spoken about procurement on a number of occasions.  How much work has been done by the Department with regard to the definition of an SME within Europe?  The figure of 250 employees was mentioned, but here in Ireland we would consider a company with 50 employees as an SME.  In the context of EU procurement rules we must follow, has the Department worked hard to convince the EU of the different set of circumstances in Ireland?  In the context of procurement, will Mr. Murphy comment on the fact that it is a Swedish company that is running the Irish procurement website?  What impact does this have on Irish companies in the context of being able to access some of the tenders on offer?<\/p><p>  With regard to women entrepreneurs, last year a fund was set aside for these.  <\/p> <p>Is it proposed to commence that again this year?  It was very successful last year and was way oversubscribed.  Are we looking particularly at youth entrepreneurs?  Is the Department actively pursuing policies that would allow young people, particularly those under 25 years of age, to access funding through microfinance and so on?  Is the Department putting policies in place for people under 25 who would not have a financial track record, so that such things could be taken into consideration?<\/p><p> What level of funding will be available in respect of Horizon 2020?  The Secretary General mentioned 15% to 20% of the overall budget but what level of funding are we actively pursuing for Ireland under this?  What base of funding are we going to get?  In respect of smart regulation, page 6 refers to setting out the next steps for simplification of EU regulation.  What is the timeframe for this?  How far have we advanced in reducing red tape for our own small and medium enterprises, be they start-ups or existing companies that are coming under pressure at the moment?<\/p><p> The second paragraph deals with the youth guarantee.  How quickly does the Secretary General see us taking up the funding that is being made available?  A pilot project has been set up in Ballymun.  How quickly can we access the &euro;6 billion that is being front-loaded?  We have to obtain matching funding for some of the programmes under the youth guarantee.  How soon will we be able to put that in place?  Will it be part and parcel of our own budget for 2014?  Is there a possibility of leveraging what we might be able to access in additional funding which we used for school buildings and which we got from the European Investment Bank?  We could use that allocation to leverage other funding, apart from our own State funding.  Is that possible?  We could increase the pot significantly as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013071600008#G01600","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373981100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Secretary General and his team here today.

Is there an appetite for relaxation of those rules, considering the jobs crisis, or are they more open to abuse in light of the jobs crisis in many countries?  The Secretary General mentioned the loan facility of the competitiveness council and the targeting of financial support for SMEs.  Can he expand on the operation of this?<\/p><p>  My final question is about the EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  I presume that the agrisector would be included in those trade talks.  The importation of US agricultural products would be a concern because of the different regime that they have in respect of the use of hormones and the use of BST for milk production.  I would be concerned that if there was no proper labelling, we could have food scares that were similar to those which we had in the past.

It will have the job of co-ordinating the preparation of a youth guarantee set of proposals for adoption by Government by the end of this year, with a view to ensuring that we can put the measures in place and draw down the funding.  The portion of the EU funding that comes through the European Social Fund requires matching funding on a 50:50 basis.  Therefore, any measures under that will have to feature in the estimates process in the normal way and will have to be eligible for ESF funding in order to draw down that money.<\/p><p>  The EIB funding to which the Deputy referred is essentially a loan facility, not grant aid.  I do not have the detail of its precise terms.  I do not think they have been worked out yet.  We will certainly be anxious to ensure that they are as advantageous as possible.<\/p><p>  Before he left, Senator Cullinane raised a question about the interest rate available under various loan facilities and whether they are advantageous or high.  The problem with instruments such as the credit guarantee or the micro-finance loan fund is that by definition they are for firms that would not qualify for funding from banks and there is a risk premium associated with that.  One cannot ignore that risk premium because if one were to seek to do so one would be giving illegal state aid so it must be given on a basis that meets those requirements.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked whether there are recent examples of State aid.

We all agree that is of huge importance.  Much of the research and development investment for small companies is coming through the innovation vouchers from Enterprise Ireland.  According to some of the feedback I get that is quite bureaucratic for both the universities and the businesses involved.

How is that going to operate in real life, for example, how will we increase the level of venture capital for somebody running a business?  There was much talk earlier about female entrepreneurship.  There is significant activity in this area, and has been for the past few years.  It may not yet be quantified in reports but Enterprise Ireland has a very dedicated team working for female entrepreneurship and finds it quite challenging.

Although there are figures for the amount of money that will be available, the most important thing is to trial and test a concept that can be adapted to the Irish environment and people.<\/p><p>  The witnesses here today are not on the proposed steering group that has been set up to oversee the implementation of the youth guarantee scheme and, unless that is a mistake in the press release, I would advise revisiting that decision.  Since coming into Leinster House my understanding has been that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation focuses on creating the environment for work to happen and the Department of Social Protection focuses on providing and upskilling the people who will work in that environment.  That is a fine and happy medium but there does not seem to be any bridge between the two.  I do not know what is at play there.  There are two excellent documents, Pathways to Work and Action Plan for Jobs but it is very hard to see where they are intertwined.  For the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to say it will support the Department of Social Protection in the roll-out of the youth guarantee scheme is not enough.  There are talented people in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, six of whom are sitting across from me now, plus many others, who probably have ideas that will not be heard or sought if they are not on the steering group.<\/p><p>  I know that the Department of Education and Skills and the new SOLAS will play a part but the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has an innovative part to play in the roll-out of the youth guarantee scheme.

On the broader point, there is significant collaboration and there needs to be.  Labour activation measures must be complemented by actions taken under the broad rubric of enterprise policy.  They cannot be in two separate silos.  For example, the Action Plan for Jobs specifically cross-references Pathways for Work.  One of the disruptive reforms, one of those measures to specifically change how things are done, is JobsPlus.  At the initiative of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Government has ensured that we identified some significant players in the private sector who will become champions for each of these reforms, including for JobsPlus.  We believed it was very important that enterprise should become more directly involved in labour market activation measures so that these are not seen as something out there for young people or the long-term unemployed and which have nothing to do with enterprise.  We wanted to change that mindset.  Equally, we want enterprise to be more involved in the strategy for SOLAS and in the role of Intreo.  We will pursue this policy further and deepen the connection when we are developing the action plan for jobs for 2014.

At a very strategic level there is a significant difference between the way new enterprises are financed in Europe compared to the United States, for example.  In the United States, while bank funding is important at early stages in businesses, non-bank financing, venture capital equity, for example, provides a much higher proportion of enterprise funding and is a very definite engine of growth.  Bank financing everywhere tends to be risk-averse.  What we have been looking to do both in Ireland - because of our particular circumstances with our banks - but also more broadly at European level, between ourselves and our colleagues in the Department of Finance, is to look at ways in which European financial instruments can support more non-bank financing as well as putting in place guarantee measures and other measures that will facilitate more bank financing, particularly for SMEs.  The capital was increased by &euro;10 billion and part of that is designed to increase the level of venture capital funding.  We already have a range of programmes and Enterprise Ireland is directly involved in many of these.

With regard to the EU Patent Court, is there a concern that we could lose expertise in the country?  It has been brought to our attention from legal experts that if the EU Patent Court is based in the UK and not here, in the long run this could become difficult for Irish businesses wishing to access the expertise required to challenge a patent ruling or to register a patent.  If the Secretary General wishes, he can provide the information later.<\/p><p>  I compliment the work done on the youth guarantee scheme and Pathways to Work scheme.  It is important that the enterprise side of the Department should play a role in this regard.  The committee recognises the speed at which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has brought this issue to European level but a cross-departmental initiative is needed in order to make it work.  It is clear that the pilot stage will need to be completed in order to draw down the funding for 2014 and 2015.  Certain projects may need to be reclassified, renamed, in order to come under the guarantee.  The focus must be on youth.<\/p><p>  There is a necessity for the business community to link in with Intreo.  I am concerned that this is not really happening as yet.  There have been delays in the opening of Intreo offices because of accommodation issues.  The Pathways to Work document is excellent when taken in conjunction with the action plan for jobs but these projects need to be driven and pushed.  Businesses must be encouraged to tap into those projects through the influence of local chambers of commerce.  We need to have business engage with social protection.  This is not happening, in my view.  Perhaps the Department could encourage and drive that connection.  We are often told that local businesses are unsuccessful in finding employees.  However, I accept that on investigation there is not always proof of this statement.  We need to tell businesses that we expect them to engage with the services.  I commend the JobsPlus scheme.

There had been significant divergence between member states and between member states and the European Parliament on the length of time of the rotation period.<\/p> <p>Some in the Parliament were suggesting it should be a couple decades, while others pushed for a much shorter period.  As the Irish Presidency left it, an initial trigger point for rotation would be approximately ten years.  We suggested various possibilities for extensions, such as five years or potentially even an additional two or three years on top of that depending on whether, after the ten-year period, the company had gone to market and it was valid, through a normal procurement process, to reappoint the existing auditor.  That would get a company from ten to 15 years.  If the company was mid-merger or something like that, there might be a business case for retaining the auditor for an extra year or two.  Variants of the ten years plus five, or ten years plus five plus two or three, are floating around under the Lithuanian Presidency.<\/p><p> The other major issue related to the limit that should be imposed on audit firms in regard to audit and non-audit related income from the audit client.  The suggested approach was, on the one hand, to develop a so-called blacklist of activities which an auditor cannot provide and, on the other, to consider designating certain audit ancillary activities the audit company could do for the client while limiting the income to be earned in this way.<\/p><p> The other major question related to how the auditing profession might be overseen at European level, whether by a single institution or a network of national regulators.

I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise the witness also that the opening statement and any other documents the witness has submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.<\/p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Mr. Newman to the committee to discuss the work of the Heritage Council.  Mr. Newman has been designated as chair of the council.  It is not his first term and therefore he has a particular experience in that regard.  I look forward to the interesting exchange he will have with the committee.<\/p><p>  I note from the Heritage Council website that it takes an integrated approach to heritage, with responsibilities that include both its cultural and its natural aspects.  I would like Mr. Newman to expand on that and give the committee some insight in terms of the way that mission statement can be extrapolated.  The website states also that the heritage Acts provide a definition of &quot;heritage&quot; and its spread is truly comprehensive as it includes monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects such as art, industrial works, documents, genealogical records, architectural heritage, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes and seascapes; the list is almost endless.  It is a wide range of responsibility on which Mr. Newman can expand in terms of the resources available to the council and what that means.  We are in an era where we are almost driven demented by fiscal-speak in terms of constraints on resources but it is important that we take stock of our heritage.<\/p> <p>This weekend, I had a beautiful experience on the beautiful island of Garnish off the coast of west Cork.  It is a reminder of what is good about our country, how resilient we are and what we have to offer not just in terms of heritage but in terms of the tourism product, which is seeing a revival in terms of our economic fortunes.  That is something of which we can rightly be proud.  All too often in the public sphere, we can be critical of public administration and policy and how it is executed by Governments or various arms of the State but every now and then, it is important that we take stock and remind ourselves of what is good about that.  I now ask Mr. Newman to address the committee and afterwards, we will go to a questions-and-answers session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600003#B00200","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373980500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to address them.  In particular, I thank the Chairman for his opening words.  I could not have put it better myself.  As the Chairman mentioned, I have been chairman of the Heritage Council for the past five years so I have an intimate knowledge of it.  In summary, I have steered it in the past year and a half through a successful critical review.  The Heritage Council, along with quite a number of bodies, was reviewed thoroughly by the Department and we have come out of that with a clean bill of health.  Perhaps most importantly in the context of today's meeting, I have steered the Heritage Council through the development of the current strategic plan which runs from 2012 to 2016 so, in a way, my fingerprints and those of the board are all over the strategic plan and it is perhaps not a bad place to start.<\/p><p>  Before we begin, and I will develop some of the themes the Chairman has asked me to develop as I go through my presentation, I will introduce myself more directly to the committee.  I am a senior lecturer in archaeology at the School of Geography and Archaeology at NUI Galway where I have worked since 1996.  My main interests include the archaeology of royal sites and landscapes, most notably Tara, and I am currently co-directing an international project on the life and legacy of St. Columbanus, not to be confused with St. Columcille.  Columbanus is the saint who made the major foundations in France and Italy at Bobbio where he died in 615.  The Chairman was on Garnish Island recently, while I have recently been in Bobbio.  There is a very strong sense of the permanence, durability and impact of Irish culture not just on our shores but elsewhere.  The Heritage Council is very aware that this is part of our public face or &quot;shop window&quot;.  Archaeology is one of the cornerstones of heritage in Ireland with the result that my day job at NUI Galway and my position at the Heritage Council converge to the benefit of both.<\/p><p>  The Heritage Council pre-dates its establishment as a statutory body in 1995 by about six years and so has played a central role in Irish heritage management, development and promotion for almost a quarter of a century so it is very much on the landscape.  It has been a privilege to be associated with it for the past five years and to be considered for re-appointment.  What I find so interesting is how the Heritage Council has managed to shape itself to the different ways people express, celebrate and value their heritage and to its extraordinary diversity.  The body I was appointed to five years ago seemed at first sight to have evolved in a way that appeared quite organic but which I came to realise was actually very deliberate.  It is a bottom-up organisation that has carefully mapped itself onto the phenomenon of living history.  There is almost a tautology in that living history is like a contradiction in terms.  It makes it very special and peculiar because of the nature of past and present converging in what we call heritage.  For a phenomenon that is so ethereal, the strength of the ties between people and their heritage is remarkably strong and resilient, as the Chairman noted, probably because they are so personal and speak to communal values.  Our common heritage is what makes us who we are when we meet together as communities.  Yet it is also a remarkably fragile phenomenon and requires a light and sensitive touch, which is why the bottom-up approach is so important.  Perhaps we can develop this later on in the questions-and-answers session.  The Heritage Council has developed networks and support mechanisms that allow individuals and communities to care for and promote their own heritage not just in line with international standards but regularly setting them.  For example, in the past six months, a major delegation from Kosovo came to visit the Heritage Council with a view to replicating it in Kosovo.  At the time, I was supervising a Master's student from Kosovo who was funded by the European Commission as part of its efforts to help them rebuild their heritage infrastructure in war-torn Kosovo.  It is quite interesting to see that the Heritage Council is an organisation that other countries are looking to replicate.  As the Chairman mentioned at the start, one of the unique attributes of the Heritage Council is the combination of natural and cultural heritage.  The fact is that they cannot be separated.  The man cannot be taken from bog but I would argue that the bog cannot be taken from the man.  We shape the landscapes around us and they in turn shape who we are.  It is that combination that makes a visitor to our shores very aware that they are in Ireland.  It is not just the people and their accent and language.  It is the entire ambience that is created by the place we have created, warts and all, good and bad.  The Heritage Council is one of the most networked statutory bodies, reaching into every parish in the country.  That networking and the need for that type of networking given the phenomenon that is living history was one of the things singled out for commendation in the critical review.  It was recognised from the start that this is eminently suited to the peculiarities of heritage.  It is not an approach that can be replicated at Departmental level.  In other words, a civil service <i>per se<\/i> would find it difficult to replicate that type of networking.  Our connections go from other State bodies right down to individuals.  That grouping of associations makes the work very interesting but complex and specialised at the same time.<\/p><p>  Networks aside, one of the functions of the Heritage Council that I regard as particularly important is the development of policy.  The Heritage Council has been an engine room of policy development concerning Irish heritage since its inception and I am glad to see that the critical review identified this as a core function.  In respect of the wide purview or gaze of the Heritage Council, the Chairman mentioned the almost dizzying amount of things that can be categorised as heritage.  Standing back from that and with that as its remit gives the Heritage Council a perspective across natural and cultural heritage and a type of expertise that is unique.  It positions it really well to develop and recommend policy initiatives.  One that the committee has undoubtedly been aware of is the development of a national landscape strategy.  This is urgent because it speaks to a type of joined-up thinking about every aspect of the Irish landscape.  If we achieve this, and I have every confidence we will, it will be a major milestone in the maturation of the governance of the Irish landscape and will be a box ticked in terms of our commitments as a signatory to the European Landscape Convention, which is a very important document.  Many other countries are ahead of us on this curve and have developed what are called landscape observatories.  This is something the Heritage Council is developing as I speak.  I have already said that I have a particular in landscapes albeit archaeological ones but it is not possible to distinguish archaeological landscapes from all the other types of landscapes.  Consequently, my interest specifically in landscape has meant that over the past number of years, I have been heavily committed to and involved in the development of the proposals coming from the Heritage Council in the direction of landscape feeding into the national landscape strategy.  We are developing a viewer which will capture all the basic data that decision and policy makers need on the landscape - the state of the landscape - and I expect that this will be delivered within the next year.  <\/p><p>  One of the pitfalls of being so networked, however, is dissipation of profile.   Due to the fact that the Heritage Council's philosophy focuses on support and capacity-building, so much of the work of the council occurs below the radar screen.  Success for the Heritage Council is when a community identifies an aspect of its heritage that it wishes to promote, revive, enjoy and share and if we can help it achieve that, that is a success for us.  They are small building blocks but they make a big difference to people's lives.<\/p> <p>As a consequence we are very much behind the scenes.<\/p><p> This creates a vulnerability because it is too easy to lose sight of the fact that the Heritage Council's ability to assist is based on behind-the-scenes structures we have put in place and networks we have established and nurtured.  Our ability to maintain these and support the communities they service has been sorely dented by massive cutbacks in our funding over the last five years from approximately &euro;20 million in 2008 to just under &euro;7 million in 2013.  As a result, last year we were able to fund only 250 projects, and only modestly at that.  This represents just 26% of the total number of applications for support from the Heritage Council.  Approximately 75% of our applicants went away disappointed because we did not have the money to support them in doing what they do in their home localities where their heritage is visible and where they want to make something of it, make it more attractive and sustainable.<\/p><p> A key message from the Heritage Council just before I signed off as chairperson at the end of May was that if the grants are re-instated, at a cost of &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million, 250 to 300 communities around Ireland will benefit again.  This is a priority of ours for 2014.  This year, as a result of the cutbacks, we have had to cancel our grants programme and that was a very difficult decision to make.  Many communities around the country were disappointed by that.  They understand the circumstances in which we work but the situation is unsustainable and we must claw back that ground as a matter of priority.<\/p><p> It is ironic that the State spends millions of euro every year promoting Ireland as a tourism destination, with the usual emphasis on monuments and iconic landscapes, yet is cutting back wholesale on maintaining and developing those assets and the scientific research and on-going monitoring that is vital to the well-being of the Irish heritage resource.  We must reverse this disconnect, particularly because today&rsquo;s heritage tourist to Ireland is savvy.  Notwithstanding the amazing weather we have at the moment, people tend not to come to Ireland for the weather but for the culture and landscapes.  As a result of the evolution in thinking among people generally, a tourist coming to visit a place or object, such as the Book of Kells, is often as interested in how it is being cared for and looked after into the future and the science of that as he or she is in the object or the place itself.  We call this shared stewardship, the sense that everybody has to roll up their sleeves and take some measure of responsibility for looking after the heritage assets we have.  It is all over this morning's news that Fingal County Council had to fill 3,000 plastic bags with rubbish off the beaches in Portmarnock.  Everybody has a role to play in this and the Heritage Council is one of the agencies of the State that is trying to get that message across.  I will return to this later.<\/p><p> I spoke earlier about structures and networks, and these represent a nascent sector.  The Heritage Council sees the need for a sectoral profile and identity for heritage in Ireland and to this end the Heritage Council networks the bodies under its wing, such as the National Biodiversity Data Centre, the Discovery Programme, the county heritage officers and the Irish Walled Towns Network.  The Heritage Council tries to harness them together and make them greater than the sum of their parts.  The professions we associate with heritage such as archaeology, genealogy, place names and ecology are all professions in their own right and can operate in their own professional bubble.  However when one applies the word \"heritage\" to them it changes that because they have to start working in tandem and in partnership and reimagine themselves in this broader context of heritage.<\/p><p> Although heritage is an old word and concept, it is comparatively new in terms of the management of what we would previously have called monuments, buildings and special areas of conservation.  It includes our landscapes.  Trying to get a sufficient number of practitioners in each of these disciplines to see themselves as operating under the umbrella of heritage is a way of creating a sectoral identity.  That is important for everybody because it results in a much closer proximity and dialogue between the general public and practitioners and makes the heritage and the language more accessible.  As a result it begins to engender a sense of shared stewardship and people begin to feel this is their own heritage and they can participate in its well-being and enjoy that process.  It has taken time to build up this structure, and protecting it and the 70 mostly non-public sector jobs has been our priority in making that decision concerning our budget distribution last year, but, as I said, our priority for 2014 is to re-establish the heritage grants.<\/p><p> So many of the benefits of heritage are immeasurable, and rightly so.  Local heritage projects around the country generate tangible and intangible benefits.  Sometimes the way they support local jobs is visible, sometimes it is not.  This makes it difficult to ascertain the value added by investment in heritage.  Two years ago the Heritage Council commissioned research into one of the more measurable aspects of heritage, namely built heritage, meaning historic buildings, houses, castles etc.  The results demonstrate that approximately 37,000 full time equivalent employees exist around built heritage alone.  Some 24,000 people are directly supported by the built heritage of the country alone.  Irish tourism benefits to the tune of about &euro;700 million out of a total of &euro;1.5 billion to the nation&rsquo;s gross value added.  These are serious figures that highlight the economic importance of heritage and the jobs associated with it and tell us it has not reached capacity.  If I leave the committee with no other message it is that there are employment opportunities around heritage, directly and indirectly.  If the money is there and is invested carefully in a sustainable way we can deliver more jobs on the back of this amazing resource we have been gifted by history here in Ireland.<\/p><p> Perhaps it is because I am a university lecturer, or perhaps because I am a parent, that I see the wonderful classroom at hand that is our heritage.  It takes a gifted teacher to hold the attention of a child, or even a third-level student, for ten minutes in the classroom.  If that classroom is a seaside rock pool, castle, worm farm, tenement re-enactment or hedgerow in full bloom and humming with insects, it is hard to drag them away from it.  I wanted to finish by talking about education lest I leave the impression that I see heritage primarily as a tourism resource.  I do not believe that is the case because first and foremost it is ours to benefit from and share.  If we do not look after it nobody will.  We can harness so much from it.  It is a huge outdoor classroom available to us and we need to exploit that.  The Heritage Council does to an extent through its heritage in schools programme.  This has reached capacity, not in terms of the number of schools asking for it but in terms of the budget available to us to develop it.  We need to be able to pump more money into the heritage in schools programme because everybody is benefiting from it.  It is creating jobs for the people who deliver it and really interesting and lasting educational opportunities for children.<\/p><p> Heritage Week is coming up at the end of August.  There were approximately 1,600 Heritage Week events last year.  A few weeks ago the co-ordinator told me she had turned Heritage Week from an event into a campaign.  She meant the spirit of shared stewardship and partnership permeates every event so that the hundreds of thousands of people who attend Heritage Week events are not just entertained but leave with a better understanding of what heritage is.  That is why it is important to look after it.  It grows every year.  The success of Heritage Week speaks louder than any other voice of the importance Irish people attach to their heritage and the Heritage Council plays a role in making that voice heard.  It would be an honour to remain part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Newman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373981700,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Newman, who has a very impressive CV.  It is quite difficult to pin down one aspect because the remit is so wide, so I will just ask some questions to tease out the issues.<\/p><p>  Mr. Newman referred to the Heritage Council's sectoral role and the heritage network.  I am very interested in this because, clearly, some aspects are very fragmented.  Mr. Newman would obviously have a role in terms of the archives.  Anyone having experience of either formal or informal records can see there is a huge missed opportunity in this regard.  For example, even the railway records are a substantial set of records which are maintained by a voluntary archivist, and then there are the major archives maintained by the General Register Office, GRO.  How would Mr. Newman envisage pulling all of that together or is this possible?  Would money be available from the Ireland Fund of from philanthropy?  This is not just about our heritage for those living on the island but it is also very much that those records belong to the people who emigrated and who want to reconnect with that sense of place that can be created when they find a location to which they are connected.  There is a huge opportunity but we are not exploiting it, except in a piecemeal way.  For example, the GRO records could be a very good census substitute if they were searchable online, and this is an opportunity that could be cost-neutral.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the work of the Irish Walled Towns Network.  The history of the walled towns is fascinating but it has largely gone unnoticed up to the recent past.  Does the Heritage Council have other initiatives which would be packageable in the same way as that network?  It is useful to see what can be done but what we have not been able do because of the lack of funding.  I am shocked by the reduction in the amount of money available to the Heritage Council as I had not realised it was that much.<\/p><p>  With regard to the area of planning and the national landscape strategy, during the Celtic tiger madness it was a rearguard action to try to keep things that were worth keeping, and I found myself in that position on several occasions.  In terms of getting people to buy into the landscape strategy, how does the Heritage Council develop policy whereby people actually value something in its own right before it gets rezoned because there is a lovely landscape or a gorgeous building?  Will there be engagement in that policy formation in a wider sense?  Clearly, if one develops a landscape strategy, there will be limitations, and it is these limitations that often come into conflict.<\/p><p>  I was very impressed with the number of people employed.  When one thinks of the Guinness Hop Store and the Cliffs of Moher centre in County Clare, we can see why there would be both private and public sector employment.  I am curious about the engagement with philanthropy and the prospects for the Ireland Fund, as well as the potential for developing the sectoral role to a greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600006#E00100","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1373981700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Newman the very best in his new role.  From his CV, he appears to be eminently qualified.

I know they did outsanding work in the past and I would like to see them retained, so I hope every effort is made to do that.<\/p><p> Heritage Week is a fantastic opportunity for the wider public to think about their heritage.  With regard to the schools, we have perhaps lost a little of the value that should be placed on our heritage and perhaps our young people do not value enough what we have.  What are Mr. Newman's thoughts on how we move forward with this, rather than just teaching history, given there is so much more to it?<\/p><p>  The national landscape strategy should have been published by now.  What are the reasons for the delay?

On the future of the archives, Ireland has a very mixed track record of looking after its archives, and some of them are literally rotting before our very eyes while others are in an excellent state of preservation.  We are fortunate we live in an age where digital technology allows us to digitise so much so much of our archives, and in particular to digitise them in searchable ways.  For example, a number of projects are going on in the Digital Hub or with regard to digital humanities.  At this stage, the technology is available to us and it is a question of personnel and resources, which obviously boils down to money.  We need to be able to harness those in a way that does not damage the archive itself but turns it into a digital format in a way that is accessible.<\/p><p>  There are obviously difficulties with the integration of all of those different digital formats.  For example, we all have old computers and disks at home that we can no longer use because of their obsolescence.  It is an ongoing commitment.  Digitising an archive is not the end of the job; in fact, it is the beginning of a long-term commitment.  If we are going to go down that road in Ireland, which we already have done to some extent, we have to do it with our eyes open as to the long-term commitment.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right to point out the interest in the archives of all kinds of bodies, from the religious orders down to organisations like railway societies and so on.  There is an extraordinary compendium of information out there and an amazingly diverse audience of interest all over the world.  It is ironic that people often become more interested in their roots and history when they leave these shores, as they are at the moment in their droves, than when they are on them.  There is an opportunity there for philanthropic investment in archives.  The Heritage Council is actively looking at this at the moment.  We have just established a working group to look into the whole area of alternative avenues of funding, partly as a reaction to the huge cutbacks we have suffered in recent years but partly also because it is a way of getting a bigger buy-in from a wider audience.  If I have not fully answered the Deputy's question, we can come back to it.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Murphy for mentioning the Irish Walled Towns Network.  It is a network of towns in Ireland that started life as, or at least at one point in their history became, walled medieval towns.  We tend not to think we have them in Ireland, and we tend to visit them when we are on holidays in France.  However, we have walled towns in Ireland, including some quite spectacular ones.  It is very important they are looked after and even creating a network in and of itself has raised the profile of towns and what it is one has to do to preserve the sense that one is in a walled town.  A walled town has a very particular sense.  There is a sense of being outside it, because one is extra-mural, and then inside it.  The way that spatial development and planning happens both inside and outside the walled town is terrifically important to the maintenance or recreation of the ambience of a walled town.<\/p><p>  Deputy Murphy asked whether we have other rabbits in the hat, as it were, that we can pull out and that would be networked in that sort of way.  At the moment, no, we do not, although I am sure the Deputy is aware of the pilot project in Rindoon, County Roscommon, which involves an extraordinarily well-preserved deserted medieval town.<\/p> <p>Using a slow sustained approach we have put it on the map and it attracts tourists.  A body of people is interested in these deserted medieval villages and it may well be something we could consider for the future.  When the Heritage Council identifies a motif such as the Irish Walled Towns Network we try to develop a number of pilots which lead to a template which others can follow, so rather than a bunch of communities waiting for the Heritage Council to arrive on their doorstep and deliver it for them, they learn how to do it from others and share the experience.<\/p><p> The question on getting buy-in to the national landscape strategy is very apposite.  As I stated during my presentation, this is with regard to the incredible delicate phenomenon of living history.  People have interesting and complex ways of attaching to their heritage and expressing these values.  These values are not static; they constantly evolve and change as we re-examine history and look at it from today's perspectives with new insights.  The key to getting buy-in is a combination of time and humility.  The worst one can do is arrive and state we will solve everything, tell a community it has brilliant heritage, what that heritage is and how to manage it.  Immediately the community will stop listening and will become slightly divorced from its own heritage because the people no longer feel it is theirs because it is being spoken about it in unfamiliar language with values which are also unfamiliar.  The key to the national landscape strategy is giving it time, listening to people and using the opportunity for education.<\/p><p> The question was asked as to whether education <i>per se<\/i>is valued enough and it was stated there is more to heritage than simply history.  This is correct, which is why I stated the Heritage Council would like to achieve a sense of sectoral identity, but this is management talk which forgets our sense that heritage is something in and of itself and is a combination of many things.  In Ireland we need to move from a situation where heritage is a minority interest to where it is more common and routine for people to speak of it, and understand that heritage speaks to an integration of various value systems and areas of interest and that we educate people about this.  The heritage in schools programme is very valuable but it is still at the mercy of school teachers and whether they are interested in having an expert speak to the children in the classroom.  If possible we would like very much to introduce it as a more routine dimension in the curriculum at primary and second level, so whether the pupils continue to third level education or not they emerge with a sense of what it is to belong to this country and the way it works.  They would have a sense of the plate to which they need to step up to preserve and maintain the values they have inherited, and see it not as the chains of history but rather steps on a ladder to a brighter future with an Irish gloss.<\/p><p> The submission from the Heritage Council to the national landscape strategy emphasised repeatedly the importance of public consultation and public buy-in.  It will not work if the public is not on board.  It cannot be rushed.  It is quite correct to ask why it has not been published but I cannot give the answer.  The Heritage Council has pushed for it.  Much progress was made two years ago and then we went into a critical review process.  I understand the development of the national landscape strategy was held in abeyance until this process was complete because the same office was carrying out the critical review and it was simply a question of not being able to do everything at the same time.  It has kick-started again and it will be interesting to see how it emerges.  My desire is that the national landscape strategy will have at its core the principle of public engagement on an ongoing basis, and not just public consultation, which is easy, but public engagement with a sense of ownership.  This is because in Ireland we desperately need a sense of ownership of the landscape with a sense of generosity rather than being closed.<\/p><p> I briefly mentioned philanthropy in respect of the future of our archives and the Heritage Council is looking into this at present.  Typically philanthropists are interested not in funding day-to-day running costs but in funding particular projects.  When the group meets in the Heritage Council one of its jobs will be to examine specific projects which might be able to attract the attention of external and philanthropic funding.  The type of projects likely to succeed are particular conservation projects or heritage motifs of which a philanthropist can see the beginning, middle and end, and its configuration.  One of the council members, Dr. Henry J. Lyons, who will leave the Heritage Council next week as his term has come to an end, has much expertise in philanthropic funding.  He is one of the people behind the Jeanie Johnston project and the restoration of the Blennerhassett windmill in County Kerry with which some committee members are familiar.  All of this was funded through philanthropic funding.  We hope to be able to avail of Dr. Lyons's expertise in this regard when we reconvene.<\/p><p> I share Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's praise for the heritage officers.  It is a most extraordinary network and they are an amazing bunch of people.  We need more of them.  We do not have a heritage officer in every county.  I am not as concerned as the Deputy is about the future of heritage officers because local authorities really value them and over the years they have developed a strong sense of the value of having a heritage officer on board.  Some counties are big and complex enough to merit more than one heritage officer and I would like to see the numbers increase.  I cannot see it happening in the short term but in the medium and long term we ought to think about it because as the sense of public ownership of heritage evolves there will be a greater demand for local authorities to roll up their sleeves even further in this respect.  The Heritage Council is fully committed to maintaining the heritage officer programme.  Funding is probably what the Deputy considers to be the one item which is likely to be a threat to the future of the programme, and all we can do is remind the House of the value of the heritage officers and the amazing work they do in local communities.  It is something we simply cannot afford to reverse and it needs to be grown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Newman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373982300,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Newman and wish him well in his new role as chairperson of the Heritage Council.  There has been an interrelationship between people and the landscape since the earliest times and regrettably many monuments, such as ring forts, have been destroyed in some parts of our country.  The management of our heritage depends very much on public awareness and education giving people an insight into what should be preserved and how to properly conserve our landscape.  Mr. Newman spoke about Heritage Week, which has been a great success and has been running for the past ten years.  However, it does not seem to change.<\/p> <p>Many artifacts relating to the folklore and so on of areas are stored in damp rooms around the country, particularly in this city.  They should be returned to communities so that they could create a greater awareness of their areas.  Perhaps this possibility could be considered during Heritage Week, as could the possibility of making available grants to support heritage week.<\/p><p> When I was growing up, there were 26 or 28 thatched houses in my locality.  This number has reduced to three because they are expensive to maintain and rethatch.  The grant for thatched houses has not increased in line with inflation.  It remains at &euro;2,000 plus.  This issue needs to be examined as soon as possible.  Otherwise, thatched houses will be a thing of the past and will only be seen on postcards, in magazines, etc.<\/p><p> We also need more heritage trails.  Walking has become a wonderful pastime for people in recent years.  By publishing brochures and selecting built and cultural heritage sites along routes, this sector could be developed.<\/p><p> We need a holistic approach to the development of the River Shannon, which is Ireland's central heritage monument.  The River Shannon callows are important to our natural heritage and should be viewed along the same lines as set-asides, in that farmers should be compensated.  Their lands are often flooded during the winter and they should receive grant aid to leave them unused.  The Heritage Council could work with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on this suggestion.<\/p><p> I wish to discuss an issue that has been raised with me concerning the council's website.

In some cases, bureaucracy and excessive regulation are applied to local communities that are undertaking projects.  Local councils' heritage officers do a great deal of valuable work, but there are many areas that they do not reach.

Deputy Bannon referred to how, notwithstanding the success of heritage week, monuments were being destroyed around the country on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>The only answer is public awareness and education and placing a greater emphasis on conservation in the course of schooling.  The implication of what the Deputy said is that our generation was not exposed enough to such thinking.  I mentioned in my written presentation - although I did not read it into the evidence - that we could all benefit from returning to the classroom to learn about the vulnerability of monuments.<\/p><p> Some monuments appear to be more vulnerable than others.  As the Deputy mentioned, ring forts are being destroyed on a regular basis and part of the problem is the definition of monuments.  He asked how does one define a monument?  I shall segue and ask why is no action taken when a monument is destroyed?  In this regard I cannot answer the Deputy's latter question.  I do not know why more punitive action is not taken when monuments are destroyed.  We have a poor track record for doing so.  The Heritage Council is not the regulatory body and, therefore, it is not our function to rap people on the knuckles for destroying a monument.  It would be nice to see the regulatory body, the National Monuments Service, being encouraged to be more proactive in terms of punitive interventions in the case of reckless destruction.<\/p><p> The solution is difficult because often the people who are involved in and responsible for the destruction are not going to be changed.  These situations must be handled carefully because we do not have the people power to monitor the monuments and landscape all of the time.  Even national monuments are not monitored on a 24-hour basis.  As the committee will know, a couple of years of ago the Lia Fail standing stone on the Hill of Tara was damaged with hammer blows and, again, nobody was monitoring the site.  Trust and faith are greatly important principles behind the preservation of monuments and landscape but they must be underpinned by education.  The Heritage Council is trying to provide such education and the State services could lend more weight to that agenda.<\/p><p> Deputy Bannon suggested that more local material should be made available to local museums and so on.  That scheme is evolving but slowly.  The Heritage Council introduced a museums standards programme quite a number of years ago.  Local museums can go forward for accreditation and are chaperoned and tutored through the process of improving every aspect of their offering as a museum.  That includes recording, security and emergency measures, lighting and all of the different things that make up a certifiable museum.  The success of the programme has resulted in better museums being distributed around the country and, therefore, the national collection being accordingly distributed to those museums.<\/p><p> The National Museum of Ireland is the primary repository of archaeological material.  With the standards of museums improving it is more willing to lend material.  The worst thing that can happen is that objects are lent or given to museums that are not in a position to look after them so they can be lost or whatever.  These are the things that we need to be careful about.  I agree with the Deputy that every county should have its own museum which should be the primary port of call for people living in and visiting the county who want to get a sense of its history and vernacular.  It is a subject where the Deputy and I would share common ground.     <\/p><p> Like the Deputy, I live in an area that has thatched houses.  They are disappearing bit by bit.  It takes a lot of commitment on the part of the owner-occupier to preserve them.  I agree with him that we need to spend more money on preservation.  The Heritage Council has very little money but we match the grant provided to cover the cost of thatching.  The council has its own rubric.  It wants vernacular thatching designs and techniques used so that a project does not just look like a thatched house but has genuinely been thatched in the manner that is appropriate to its region and county and also, as far as possible, local materials are used.  Our insistence of that does not just keep authenticity but generates employment.  As the Deputy will probably know, quite a lot of the reeds are imported from Turkey.  Ireland is capable of producing its own reeds and there is a small nascent industry developing in the River Shannon callows, particularly down the south east aspect where people are harvesting and growing reeds, in so far as one can grow a natural product.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is right.  Thatched houses are also a concern of mine.  I would hate to see them reduced to just photographs on John Hinde postcards because that would be the last of them.  They are part and parcel of who and what we are and they are beautiful.  The Heritage Council is very aware of the problem.  One of its newly appointed members is Dr. Fidelma Mullane and she is an expert in vernacular architecture and thatching and has been an inspector of thatching for a number of years.  The Deputy can be confident that particular ball will not be dropped by the Heritage Council.  If we can promote and develop it then that is exactly what we will do.  <\/p><p> Deputy Bannon also called for more heritage trails.  We do need more access to the Irish landscape.  We have had a couple of really shining success stories in recent years.  For example, the Newport-Mulranny cycle track that has now been extended to the Westport-Achill cycle track.  It has opened up a big chunk of the landscape and part of it utilises a disused railway line.  A lot of visitors have used it.  I have cycled it twice and my daughter has cycled it three times.  If one goes to the Headford Road, near where I live, on a weekend one can see that every second car driving in the direction of Mayo has bicycles strapped on its back or roof-rack.  Mr. Manchan Magan has written eloquently on the economic benefits to be gained from the cycle track.  Galway County Council, for instance, is planning to extend the cycle trace the whole way around Lough Corrib and back into Galway.  The plan is afoot as we speak.  That is just one example.  <\/p><p> People have a great appetite for accessing the landscape.  Many of the applicants to the Heritage Council are developing trails and now forms part of what they approach us for.  Of course the more money that we have then the more trails can be developed in a sustainable way.<\/p><p> Sustainability is one of the things that we need to be careful about, an aspect I mentioned in my presentation.  If we are going to spend so much money advertising Ireland as a tourism destination then we must ensure that tourist activities are managed in a quiet way so they do not destroy the very thing that they come here to see.  Bringing a bit of science and research to bear on trail development and so on is very important because it will protect it into the future.<\/p><p> The committee may be familiar with Croagh Patrick, which I climbed last year.  The trail of destruction along its side is of genuine concern to everyone who lives there.  We must figure out ways to allow people have as much access as they want while preserving the site.  That involves a bit of science which in turn involves investment, both of which we need urgently.  We cannot tart up places and bring tourists in but let them act as agents of erosion and destruction.  For example, I see the erosion and so on at the Hill of Tara on a daily basis.<\/p><p> Deputy Bannon suggested that we adopt a holistic approach to the River Shannon and I agree with him.  If I could I would give him a job in the Heritage Council because he speaks our language and has raised our exact concerns.  A couple of years ago I attended a conference on the management of its river basin.  About 15 local authorities are responsible for different areas of the River Shannon.  County boundaries run down its middle so different local authorities are responsible for opposite river banks.  Consequently, the way the River Shannon and any major river is managed must be holistic, draw on the entire catchment area and be integrated.  The Deputy also mentioned the Shannon callows, which is a valuable tradition.<\/p><p> A couple of years ago those of us who live in the west became aware of what happens when one mismanages water and there was massive flooding all over the countryside.  That speaks of a lack of and forgetfulness about looking after groundwater.  Allowing groundwater to do what it normally does is all part and parcel, not just of our heritage, but our engineering and survival into the future.  The Deputy and I speak the same language on this issue as well.<\/p> <p> How does one define a national monument?  One will see a definition of a national monument in the National Monuments Act 1930.  However, fewer monuments today are being declared a \"national monument\".  It seems from my examination a couple of years ago, that there was a rush to declare monuments as a \"national monument\" around the decade of the foundation of the State.  Some of the monuments on the list of national monuments would find it much more difficult to qualify as a \"national monument\" nowadays.  I think we raised the stakes a little bit too high, but in some sense there is this part of me that thinks we should not declare artefacts to be national monuments because that focuses too much attention on one thing to the detriment of other things.  I take a more holistic approach which is to encourage the evaluation of everything without special attention to any particular one thing.  That is the better way to go because once one designates something as a \"national monument\" one is automatically stating that something else is not.  That can be alienating for people who feel a sense of attachment to the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600008#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Newman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373984100,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Deputy Bannon has already spoken for six minutes and the reply extended to 12 minutes, giving a total of 18 minutes.

Should the committee decide to dedicate a day to that visit, it would be music to our ears.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan raised concerns about the funding of the Heritage Council.  We are also concerned because our funding has been drastically cut.  We lost a great deal of ground in 2009.  Our budget was cut by upwards of 70% in 2009 and we have not recovered.  Part of the reason we have not recovered is the background economic crisis in the country.  As I have mentioned in my presentation, the problem is that we are beginning to lose ground.  If one looks at the natural resources in Ireland we have a mosaic that we have not looked after with the degree of urgency we need to.  The Heritage Council has a very small staff and a modest budget, with which it does amazing work.  I say that as a private individual not biased by my role as chairperson.  We need more funding in order to be able to continue the work we are doing.  There is an enormous appetite among the public and we are not able to service it.  If there is anything this committee can do to help lobby for more funding - the reinstatement of our grants programme for 2014 would be a major step forward in that regard - it would be very welcome.<\/p><p>  The Hunt report on Further Education and Training was raised.  I mentioned already that we need to introduce heritage as a concept in and of itself.  The integrated thinking that is represented by the word &quot;heritage&quot; itself is something that we need to bring into our education system.  As a person who works in the third level education sector, one of the things I see among first year student coming to college is that they tend to think in silos, they think in terms of biology as distinct from history as distinct from English.  They do not cross-pollinate that knowledge in the way that is needed at third level, and not just at third level but as a society we need to be able to cross-pollinate from things we know in one arena into another so that we do not make the mistakes that we have made in the past.<\/p><p>  I live near Athenry which has a famous medieval festival.  They are important and there is a company that specialised in equipping people with all the gear, right down to the weaponry they might need.  They will also rent out a horse for the day.  They are very important and they are part and parcel of what the Irish Walled Towns Network is trying to promote.  They are good for people and are good for tourism.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coonan was interested in the preservation of bogs and the importance to our heritage of our peatlands.  The Heritage Council has made a presentation in this regard to the National Peatlands Strategy in April 2011.  We speak from the perspective of heritage and we rely on others to speak from other perspectives <i>per se<\/i>.  To come back to the adage, &quot;You can take a man out of the bog, but you can't take the bog out of the man&quot;, we have some extraordinary peatlands.  Our ancestors have had to deal with peatlands in lots of different ways, both from a cultural point of view, from a religious and mythological points of view.  There is enormous archaeological potential in our peatlands that we are not looking after to the extent that we might.  There is of course the living heritage of the bogs.  It is terribly important that we do not lose sight of that.  While there is a biodiversity imperative, and the management of the water base and so on is of great importance, but so also is the living heritage of our peatlands as well.  A balanced approach which recognises the heritage value but also the biodiversity and scientific value of our peatlands is the way forward.<\/p><p>  My answer will be similar to the answer I gave in respect of the national landscape strategy, it will take time.  This is something that will have to be thought about, people need to educated much more about what the peatlands are.  When people talk about biodiversity and ecological services, one may ask what does that mean?  Every third mouthful of food we eat has been pollinated by an insect.  When members are driving back to their homes, count how many insects are plastered onto the windscreen of the car and I wager one will find that it is a fraction of what it was ten years ago.  We are losing our insects because we are losing our habitats.  Insects pollinate the fruits we grow.  This may sound like a green agenda, but my point is that biodiversity is actually critical to our species.  We cannot differentiate ourselves from the natural ecology.  We rely on it.  Our bogs are very important in that regard, to the extent, that a group of people in Holland use their own personal finance to buy Irish bogs and donate them to the Irish people.  I am not sure if members are aware of that.  All the bogs in Holland have been lost and these people know the consequences and they know we have bogs in Ireland.  They research them, they buy them and then present them but with conditions that they are to be enjoyed but are not to be tampered with.  <\/p><p>  I was asked if heritage overlaps with too many different things and whether better value for money could be gained if excessive regulations were relaxed.  That is a complex debate and I am not sure we have the time to go into this issue.  Let me return to the principle of shared stewardship, which is very important.  It is very important to have regulation.  The authenticity of the heritage resource, and the preservation of that authenticity is very important, it cannot be a facade but must be truly authentic.  That is why professionals are brought to bear on this.  Not all of it is rocket science and consequently I would like to see a situation evolve over the next decade or so where there is greater public participation in the conservation of our heritage.  If that were the case, then we would find ourselves in step with the most recent of the European conventions on cultural heritage, the so-called Faro Convention, which is a short document.  Its appeal to professionals lies in its acknowledgement of the fact that their work in cultural heritage is public property and consequently if one is privileged to be qualified to work in it one must do so in a way that the public good, which involves participation, is manifestly clear.  <\/p><p>  I was asked about how I would like to be remembered.  I would like to be remembered as the person who might have been able to claw back some of the financial losses that the Heritage Council has suffered during the course of the past five years so that we can begin to reclaim some of that ground and service the communities around the countryside.  One of the things I have found most extraordinary in the past five years of travelling around the countryside, wearing my hat as Chairman of the Heritage Council is the number of people in every second townland who has benefited from the work of the Heritage Council.<\/p> <p>It has provided an extraordinary legacy and it is painful to see that we are being compromised in our ability to pursue that, particularly because we have created momentum and appetite among the public for the work we do, but are not able to fulfil that to the extent we want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600010#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Newman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373984700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We also get some money from the National Parks and Wildlife Service in respect of the operations of the national biodiversity data centre in Waterford.  Our funding situation is critical.  As I mentioned, we had to cancel our grants programme for this year, but we cannot sustain that.  Our priority for 2013 was to try to preserve the infrastructure we had put in place, such as the national biodiversity data centre discovery programme and so on.  If we lose those, we will not see them back in our lifetime.  Also, there are 70 jobs directly associated with that.  It is much more difficult to calculate the number of jobs that are influenced or affected by our grants programme.  We felt the grants programme could probably, just about, withstand one year of cancellation, but not two.  Otherwise, we begin to lose people's confidence and momentum.  We cannot afford for that to happen into the future.<\/p><p>  With regard to local authority heritage officers, we have a tug of war of love between the county councils and ourselves because we pay part of the salary of the heritage officers, on a sliding scale.  When a county council takes on a heritage officer, we pay the bulk of the salary, but as the years pass, the ratio changes and eventually they become funded 75% by the county council or local authority and 25% by the Heritage Council.  Most heritage officers have been in place for a number of years now and they are well embedded and regarded by the county managers.  Any of the county managers I have met over the years have nothing but praise for their heritage officers and the work they do.  They are a very committed bunch of people and have an interesting range of qualifications, everything from archaeology to botany.  There is also an anthropologist among them.  They work well as a group and we are very careful to ensure they have ongoing training at the Heritage Council and that they get together regularly so they can exchange ideas.  I think the future is very bright for the heritage officers.  We are deeply committed to that programme and would like to grow the portfolio if we could.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013071600011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Newman"},{"type":"speech","time":1373984700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>That is great.

On behalf of the committee I am delighted to welcome to the meeting Mr. David Kitching, policy adviser at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, FEPS.  Mr. Kitching has travelled from Brussels to be here with us and we are very grateful to him for that.  FEPS is a leading Brussels-based think tank which aims to develop progressive thinking and strengthen the socialist, social democratic, labour and democratic progressive ideas in the European Union and indeed throughout Europe.  It is close to the Party of European Socialists, PES, of which many of us here are members, but it is nonetheless an independent body.<\/p><p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is another in a series on the issue of the future of the European Union.  In recent months we have debated widely on how to secure democratic legitimacy and accountability and we are keen to explore with Mr. Kitching the views of the FEPS on how national parliaments can underpin democratic legitimacy in the European Union context.<\/p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing ruling to the effect that members should not comment on or make charges against a person by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>  I invite Mr. Kitching to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600003#B00800","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373983200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to come and speak here.  While I represent the Foundation for European Progressive Studies I happen to be an Irish citizen too.  As a result I take this meeting very seriously and hope that I can offer a perspective that might be of some use to the committee.  I will begin by addressing matters of economic, budgetary and fiscal co-ordination, followed by the political angle.  If it is acceptable to the committee, I will save the commentary on the situation of the United Kingdom until the discussion afterwards.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the committee&rsquo;s invitation made direct reference to the European semester process, a cycle of economic and fiscal policy co-ordination in existence since 2010.  The objective is to ensure sound finances, foster growth and prevent macro-economic imbalances.  Even this process raises issues about legitimacy and accountability in terms of the lines that can be crossed by partners in areas such as surveillance and other kinds of intervention.  Indeed, many proposals for budgetary co-ordination cite the potential for central authorities to veto certain national legislation.  This is often linked to the restrictive rule that national deficits should not exceed 3% of GDP.  Adherence would be maintained through a mix of financial sanctions, default mechanisms and debt mutualisation as a carrot.  When it comes to the use of mechanisms such as eurobonds, national governments need to decide the level of control they are willing to cede in the interests of efficiency.  The economic structures of the European Union are affected by sensitive political questions regarding the most legitimate level of co-ordination for each type of legislation.  As one would expect, there are radically different perspectives on where these lines should be drawn.<\/p><p>  Decision-making on economic, budgetary and fiscal co-ordination requires the appropriate institutional mechanisms.  At present, the ECB is very limited in its capacity to improve things due to its focus predominantly on monetary stability.  Monetary targets focus on inflation but the ECB needs real targets, with a focus on economic and social outcomes such as tackling unemployment.  A more active ECB with the ability to issue bonds to cover state debt could be a huge help in this regard.  Monetary stability is vitally important but it should be accompanied by a more ambitious strategy for full employment and increase in demand.  To achieve this, the ECB and the EU require significant structural and institutional changes in the long term.  In particular, it is time to make the ECB politically accountable, thereby removing its independent status.  The European Investment Bank is another facility whose lending scope could be widened.  It has great potential to increase employment and demand through project bonds and targeted investment.  Many of the proposals for a stronger political union require a larger EU budget and even the potential for the creation of a supranational finance ministry.  Once again, the corresponding loss of fiscal control at national level might be a bridge too far in many member states.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, it is necessary for us to develop a coherent perspective on our institutional preferences in the European Union.  I understand the considerable effort that went into the referendum campaign on the fiscal compact treaty and the political pressure to pass it.  At the time FEPS research indicated that the treaty could prove damaging in the long term because it narrowly constrains the capacity of national governments to use fiscal policy as a counter-cyclical mechanism at times of crisis.  When we need to boost public investment we may not have the necessary tools in future crises.<\/p><p>  I will turn now to political integration.  Suggestions for integration initiatives abound in Brussels.  The most noticeable proposal of recent years, in media terms at least, has been the introduction of a directly-elected President of the European Commission.  Of course, the secrecy in which the president is chosen must end.  At the moment it is more akin to a papal conclave than an electoral process.  On a continent dominated by parliamentary democracy, a US style presidential election seems slightly incongruous.  A more realistic option could be indirect elections through the process of the European Parliament elections.  In this sense, in next year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections, following a proposal from the Party of European Socialists in 2009, the main European political parties have agreed to select top candidates or their preferred option as the Commission president and they will campaign with them on the ground in the member states, in an effort to give a broader political mandate to, and link between, the European Parliament and the Commission.  Other proposals from Brussels, such as transnational party lists or others, aim to deepen political integration but they require significant treaty changes for measures that are merely cosmetic.<\/p><p>  In Brussels, I have always argued that treaty changes can be difficult but if they are unavoidable, we must make them count.  Measures to enhance living standards across the EU are bound to have more legitimating outcomes than fanciful daydreams.  Any suggestions proposed by FEPS would require new treaties, especially those requiring institutional transformation, such as changing deficit rules or a proposed employment and stability pact.  It is also very important that the politicisation of Europe is evident at member state level.<\/p> <p>Europe is often presented as a monolith where one is either pro or anti-EU.  It is not always readily apparent that there are diverse and conflicting ambitions for EU integration.  In this sense, legitimacy depends on being given a political choice and European political parties have a vital role to play in this regard.  In recent years, populist voices have grown louder as the politics of grand coalition and consensus invite charges of cosy elitism.  Furthermore, the tendency for governments to hide behind the EU when implementing unpopular measures has damaged the credibility of the European Union in certain member states.  On the question of how far integration should go, the gap between the inherently ethical nature of public decision-making and the utilitarian nature of much of modern debate in many parts of the world has pushed a wedge between citizens and their representative institutions.  Political discourse is limited.  Alternative paradigms are rejected and unconventional thought is dismissed.  Taken to the European level, the constraints imposed on fiscal policy by ideological positions upheld in the treaties have put into law the idea that there are no alternatives.  The net effect has been suspicion of further integration.  <\/p><p> There are very significant benefits from further integration, but only if it is on appropriate political and economic terms.  Citizens need to see their public institutions as symbols of power held in common.  In Europe, this means adhering to the community method, giving the appropriate role to the European Parliament and linking this to the national parliaments in a constructive relationship.  <\/p><p> Democratic legitimacy and accountability can be enhanced in a number of ways.  In economic, budgetary and fiscal matters, the Foundation for European Progressive Studies advocates a politically accountable ECB and the use of the European Investment Bank as a means of stimulating investment in the real economy with a focus on job creation.  Further political integration must be linked to the idea of improving citizens' living standards.  Therefore, the legislative framework of the EU needs a link to preferred social and economic outcomes.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its kind invitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600003#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Kitching","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373983800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kitching and I thank him for his presentation which is immensely stimulating and one of several we have heard in recent weeks which hopefully will be of benefit to us all as Europeans and as Irish citizens.  It is important to examine what has happened in the past 50 to 60 years in an attempt to identify the positive aspects which may be of value in the future.  There is a tendency to throw away the things of the past and to start from scratch as if the institutions had failed.  Many institutions have failed not by virtue of the institutions themselves, but because of the people who worked in them.  That is not a reference to Mr. Kitching's institution.<\/p><p>  Mr. Kitching referred to the transnational party lists, which in my view have a distinct disadvantage for a small country such as Ireland.  I do not like the list system anyway at the best of times and I have a problem with transnational party lists.  <\/p><p> The European Parliament has gained in strength and influence and national parliaments are allegedly gaining in strength and influence in the framing of future European policy.  How can those two points be reconciled?  A growth in the power and influence of national parliaments will strengthen renationalisation which is not in the interests of European progress or integration or the progress of the European project.  At the same time, the influence of the larger countries is strengthening considerably in the European Parliament, both in numerical strength and influence, by virtue of the gains deriving from the Lisbon treaty.  Where do small countries stand in that situation?  For example, Ireland will lose another MEP even though we have a small number of them.  The loss of one or two MEPs would have a minimal effect in the case of a large country - even the loss of ten MEPs would be minuscule - except when it comes to votes in the Parliament.  Where does this leave Ireland?  We need to be cautious about setting aside what has served us well over the past 50 years.<\/p><p>   I refer to the need for economic stimuli in the current climate.  We must be prepared to recognise the sacrifices made by people in this country and also throughout Europe.  All European people have suffered as a result of the economic downturn.  However, what is now deemed to be Keynesian economics was found in the 1930s and 1940s to lead to inflation which was a significantly undermining feature in the development and stabilisation of economies.  Is this the right time for such a policy?<\/p><p>  This is not intended as a political point but in 1977, in the midst of an economic crisis, it was deemed appropriate to re-inflate the economy, put more money in people's pockets and generate spending in the commercial sector, in order to lift the economy.  In fact, this was the wrong policy because it had the direct opposite effect; it broke the economy and set back its recovery by at least ten years.  That re-inflation of the economy caused unnecessary inflation.  House prices alone inflated dramatically during that period to such an extent that the Government of the day decided to remove house prices from the consumer price index.  <\/p><p>  Keynes was supposed to be the hero of the 1930s and 1940s but it was Galbraith who came forward with the suggestion that strict price controls were essential to control inflation which would swallow up any stimulus and drive an economy deeper into the red.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600004#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373983800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kitching for his presentation.  I have been privileged to meet him and to hear him speak on a previous occasion.  I belong to the school of thought in the debate on further and deeper economic and monetary union which is firmly of the view that economic and monetary union is not possible until social union is achieved, that there must be a social pillar to support economic and monetary union.  Otherwise, as Mr. Kitching said in his presentation, people's living standards will be at risk and citizens will be treated merely as consumers.  The notion of achieving a truly social union is the only way to ensure a political commitment from the citizens in order to bring us towards the deeper economic and monetary union.  As Mr. Kitching points out, the European Investment Bank could be a significant player in the effort to stimulate investment.  Ireland is hoping to avail of the European Investment Bank to fund education projects.  Even when EIB funding is available, it is still offset against our deficit and our expenditure.  In order for Ireland to use EIB funding to leverage social investment, it must be regarded as a social investment rather than expenditure.<\/p> <p>It would mean offsetting that against the deficit rather than including it in the fiscal targets and fiscal consolidation that are required under the rules and regulations laid down by the European Union.  It is one very feasible way in which we could work towards achieving social union and investing in people.  Social investment means trying to avoid problems before they emerge.  It means investing in areas such as child care, education, health care and elder care.<\/p><p> Another important aspect of the social pillar of economic and monetary union is the question of automatic stabilisers.  Members might be aware that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament discussed this issue last week.  The idea is that every employee would make a social contribution to a stabilisation fund.  Where unemployment in a particular member state reaches a certain designated level, automatic stabilisers would kick into place to assist it in meeting its welfare bill.  It is about ensuring there is true European solidarity and that all member states come to the rescue of the one experiencing major economic problems.<\/p><p> I am interested to hear Mr. Kitching's view on an issue that is of particular interest to me.  As we discuss the European budget and seek to finalise the trilogues in areas such as the European Social Fund, I am very concerned about the whole area of macro-economic conditionality in regard to EU funding.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  National parliaments might have to step in and demand that funding which is targeted towards dealing with the least well-off citizens is not put in jeopardy because of the fiscal rules on consolidation.  This is of particular relevance in the context of the youth guarantee fund, an issue on which I have campaigned very strongly in the European Parliament.  Countries which are due money under the youth guarantee must ensure they maximise their potential and there is no macro-economic conditionality in terms of their ability to draw down funding.<\/p><p> Finally, I concur with what Deputy Bernard Durkan said regarding the loss of one of our seats in the European Parliament.  It is a major loss to Ireland and a significant problem in the context of democratic accountability.  There are 26 committees in the European Parliament and we will now have only 11 MEPs to cover them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373984400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kitching to the committee and thank him for his presentation.

Has he identified regional as between, for example, northern versus southern blocs or eastern versus western blocs in terms of the choices to be made?<\/p><p>  I concur with previous speakers regarding the reduction in the number of MEPs.  I appreciate the need for a cap, but does Mr. Kitching believe there is a danger that a reduction in a member state's contingent of representatives in the European Parliament, particularly in the case of small countries like Ireland, might lead to a corresponding reduction in the relevance of Europe for citizens, or at least a perception thereof?  On the question of democratic accountability, would Mr. Kitching say that national politicians have a tendency to blame too many of our ills on Europe in the context of various directives, regulations, policies and so on?<\/p><p>  The Chairman indicated that Mr. Kitching is from the socialist or left side of the political spectrum, which is fine.  Given that so many countries have experienced major economic problems in recent sides, regardless of their governments' political stripes, would Mr. Kitching agree that the problems we are facing, across Europe and indeed across the world, transcend the broad left-right divide?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600005#D00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1373984400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Mr. Kitching talked about the fiscal compact and the difficulties of engaging with the electorate on it.

There have undoubtedly been major achievements.  The point I was making, however, is that one can see a certain ossification of the project in the sense that there is a level of complacency within what might be called the Brussels bubble.  People there are far removed from the realities of everyday life in their member states.  Their discussions are all with people who broadly agree with them, even across political divisions.  It is a cosy consensus way of living.  It is also very dangerous because it creates a huge chasm between the people who work within the system and those who are subject to it, namely, citizens across the European Union.  Unless we address these fundamental issues of elitism and the counter-reaction of populism, the entire project is in grave danger.<\/p><p>  It is in this context, that I am focusing on the social and economic elements.  When we consider the problems of inflation that occurred in the past we can see that there was a significant change in policy direction from the 1970s onwards.  The policy priorities moved away from employment and social initiatives towards the maintenance of stability.  Some commentators have linked the shift to the problems which followed the Maastricht treaty, when there was a huge speculative attack on the British pound and the lira, in particular, which led to the reliance on the Deutsche mark as the basis of the euro.  As a result, the German preference for the social market economy came to dominate and, with that, German fears of inflation, which are more severe than in most other countries.  As a result, we have seen slower growth, less job security and higher levels of unemployment, particularly among young people and the less skilled.  These are issues which endanger the overall achievements of the European project.  If we have that level of dissatisfaction, there is eventually going to be a backlash.<\/p><p>  The issue was raised of the relative strength of the European Parliament compared with national parliaments and how that might play out in the coming years.  The ideal situation would be for each national parliament to have a certain degree of oversight in terms of how the legislative process is conducted.  There is a trade-off, however, if we want to ensure legislation is efficient and effective in a Union of 28 member states.  The principle of subsidiarity within the European legislative process has been broadly successful in that every point of legislation is decided at its most appropriate level within the overall system.<\/p> <p>This is a matter for the European Parliament and national parliaments to decide between them.  The problem of late has been the dominance of the Council, which brings with it the dominance of larger member states.  I see this as a greater problem than, for example, the distribution of parliamentary seats.  The loss of these seats is detrimental to small member states but the tendency among larger member states towards big power plays has been more pronounced at Council level than in the European Parliament.  Part of the objective of the Parliament is to politicise the European public sphere and, ultimately, to have elected representatives as members of European political groups.<\/p><p> Ms Emer Costello, MEP, referred to the social pillar being linked into economic and monetary union.  Some of the research the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, FEPS, has had carried out would concur with what she said, namely, that any investment by the European Investment Bank, EIB, should not be offset against austerity measures within individual member states.  Such investment is meant to have a specific outcome.  One of the proposals put forward was for project bonds to be issued.  An example in this regard would be directing such bonds towards graduate start-up schemes.  In areas of the workplace where there is high gender disparity, there are specific measures which might ameliorate matters.  The youth guarantee might also be usefully linked to project bonds.<\/p><p> In the context of Deputy Kyne's points, a difficulty arises in the context of the overall discussion on democratic legitimacy and accountability.  As a small country, Ireland faces a conundrum.  It is not entirely democratically legitimate to exclude someone from the role of Commission president because he or she comes from France or another large member state.  I understand the point the Deputy is making, however, particularly in the sense that the US Senate provides an extra layer of representations for smaller states in that jurisdiction.  There would be a necessity to have some kind of mechanism in place to ensure that representation would not be lost and that the voices of small member states would not become lost in all the noise.<\/p><p> The Chairman inquired about next year's European elections.  I am quite concerned with regard to the issues on which those elections will be fought.  The European parties will have platforms on which they will wish to campaign.  In addition, they will want to bring forward certain policy proposals in order to show how they would improve the position during the lifetime of the next European Parliament.  I do not know if people will vote on those issues.  Ireland is not the only country with a huge level of disaffection.  There has been a major rise in the number of populist and extremist parties in countries such as Hungary and Greece.  There are indications that it is also happening in France and many other countries.  While many of our problems are systemic and will not be remedied overnight, it is extremely difficult to predict the outcome of the elections.  I would envisage a rather fragmented European Parliament following next year's elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Kitching","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373985000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.  I misjudged the traffic and was delayed as a result.  I have been able to interpret the thrust of Mr. Kitching's presentation from the questions which have been posed by members and the replies he has provided.<\/p><p>  If the Chairman will indulge me, I wish to offer my warm congratulations to our colleague, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has been promoted to the position of Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  The Minister of State is a person of outstanding ability and integrity.  He certainly has the capacity to do the job he has been given.  Commitment will not be an issue for him.  I also wish to pay tribute to and thank the former Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, for her absolute commitment and dedication to this committee.  I also thank her for the thoroughness of her presentations to us and the painstaking lengths she went to when providing replies to our questions.  Deputy Creighton performed outstandingly well before this committee and her work with us merits commendation.  We trust that what she has done will set the template for Deputy Donohoe in his new Ministry.<\/p><p>  Does Mr. Kitching see his foundation having an involvement, either in terms of carrying out research or from the point of view of direct intervention, in dealing with the threat relating to the United Kingdom leaving the EU?  If the United Kingdom leaves, it would have grave implications for the European project in the context of its various social and political objectives.  Such an eventuality would also have grave implications for this country on foot of its special relationship with the United Kingdom in the context of trade, culture, etc.  The United Kingdom leaving would be bad news for Ireland and the EU.  It would also be bad news for the United Kingdom itself.  Can FEPS produce any useful research which might inform the debate on this matter and tilt it against withdrawal?  Is it in a position to have a more active involvement and how does it read the situation as it currently stands?  Has the foundation carried out any initial research on the matter?<\/p><p>  I agree with all of the points made in respect of the EIB, particularly that which states that up to now we have been concentrating on stabilisation, recovery and regaining ground that was lost.  It was quite reasonable that this should have been the position for a number of years but it is vital that we should now move to the job creation and stimulus phase of the EIB's work.  In that context, the youth guarantee is important.  In the future, the way the EU will be evaluated by the UK, which is currently contemplating withdrawal, and by its citizenry will be how it deals with the horrific problem of unemployment across all member states.  There is no greater indictment of the European project than the level of unemployment which obtains at present.  This matter must be addressed and the youth guarantee and the various job initiatives are extremely important in that context.<\/p><p>  Ms Emer Costello, MEP, made a point with regard to the social pillar and care of the elderly.  I am of the view that there is tremendous potential to create employment in this sphere.  It is clear that the population in this country is ageing and that there is a need to make provision for elder care.  One would not need to carry out market research or any other form of analysis to discover that older people prefer to be treated, live in and access services from their own homes.  We also know that they want to live in their homes either with their families or independently.  Carers can play an enormous role in this regard.  If steps were taken across Europe to make the job of carers more attractive and have it classified as a valued and respected profession, this would assist us in achieving a number of objectives.  As a result of such a move, older people could remain in their homes, the pressure on care institutions and the cost for states would be reduced and unemployment could be tackled.  I am aware of many people who are in low-paid jobs who would love to stay at home and care for their relatives.  If they were allowed to do this, it would give rise to vacancies in various areas of low-paid employment.  The people to whom I have spoken about this matter are not all in low-paid employment but invariably that is the case.  There is massive potential for allowing people who want to care for their elderly relatives to remain at home, thereby creating vacancies in the labour market.  This is the type of project the EIB could reasonably pursue or support.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Kitching comment on the concept of a banking union?  I am aware that he considers this matter from a socialist perspective - which is not a difficulty and which gives matters an extra dimension - whereas we tend to see it from a slightly different one.  Is he of the view that banking union is achievable and would it offer a panacea for many of our ills?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600006#E00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1373985600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kitching for his presentation.

I am the first to admit that, in our attempts to examine democratic legitimacy and accountability in the EU, as parliamentarians we must start to look at our own legitimacy and imagery in the eyes of the electorate right across Europe.  It seems to me that we are trying to address the issue of legitimacy and accountability not only for the European Union but also for our own national parliaments.  In Europe, we have the swinging pendulum electoral process.  Whoever is in gets knocked out and whoever is out gets in.  That does not seem to be based on sharp political analysis but on an instinctive human desire to have a better quality of life which national governments are not providing right across the board.<\/p><p>  The question is whether we should start trying to make the European Union more legitimate in the eyes of our constituents or if we have to do it in reverse.  Do we have to get our constituents right across Europe to understand the role of the national parliament in its relationship with its citizens in order to ensure support for the greater parliament, namely, the European Parliament?<\/p><p>  That brings me to the point of the election, which might be controversial.  In the past we looked at France and Germany and the United Kingdom to some degree as the big strong boys, and the perception was that everyone who was smaller in terms of population or economic strength was inferior in many ways.  We must build the trust of all the economically weaker, smaller countries to attain equal status throughout Europe.  The reason I say that is because sometimes people in small countries think that the big boys are always bad.  In this country, the Germans are seen as the big baddies.  It is easy to speak through a megaphone on a platform and shout that it is all the fault of the Germans when people conveniently forget the role that is played by the national parliament.  It is not all the fault of the Germans.  In fact, it is questionable how much of the fault lies with Germany.<\/p><p>  As to how we create a link between the electorate in this country, Spain or anywhere else when it comes to an election for European parliamentarians, MEPs, I invite Mr. Kitching to elaborate further on the current thinking.  We in the Labour Party will put forward Ms Costello as our candidate.  She will be represented in the poll as a Labour Party candidate seeking election.  There is a gap in the thinking then as to whether she behaves as an independent Irish Labour Party MEP.  She does not.  There is an important role that should be developed within the European context.  We must be exposed more in these elections to the party affiliations, the role of parties, Commissioners and others who represent us in Europe.  We need to identify faces.<\/p><p>  UKIP is one political group that engages in Irish politics and further afield.  It comes to this country and seizes the limelight.  There are other oddball individuals whom I will not mention who take a particular stance.  Why is there not a <i>quid pro quo<\/i> from the European political elite to engage more with the national electorate on issues such as this?  We tend to cry wolf.  I note that 12 EU member states have lost one seat each, so we are not alone, and that Germany has lost three seats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600007#F00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1373985600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Byrne.

The United Kingdom&rsquo;s relationship with continental Europe has historically been complicated.

That tendency still exists.  One thing that worries me about the current development of the UKIP narrative on the idea of British independence is how short-sighted it is.  The demographics do not quite hold up in the sense that people who adopt the UKIP angle on issues with which it concerns itself, namely, euroscepticism, immigration and certain types of welfare, tend to be more towards the older end of the scale.

In terms of intergenerational conflict in the UK, this seems to be the last sting of the baby boomer generation.  I am not trying to be nasty, but it was the generation that benefited from the most benign economic conditions that ever existed in the UK in terms of new educational opportunities, employment and the food people were fed.  It is a generation that transferred a huge amount of debt onto subsequent generations.  Now there is the potential that the baby boomers will remove Britain from the whole European project, although in whatever capacity it might stay in the European Economic Area.  However, it will not be so easy for the UK to get back in.<\/p><p>  In terms of this country and how we fit into the whole narrative, I do not know if they have even thought about the effect it would have on Northern Ireland.  When people look at what went on up there, one refers to PEACE funds and the cash cows that came in.  I have often wondered about the comparison of the Sunningdale agreement with the Good Friday Agreement.  The latter was described by the SDLP as Sunningdale for slow learners.  Sunningdale was written at a time when both countries had just become members of the EEC and did not have much experience of the concept of shared sovereignty, of borders being more porous, and of sovereignty not following the Westphalian concept of the absolute border.  If we take that forward to 1998 when one had two countries much more at ease with such concepts, I do not think one can decouple that from the experience of European Union membership.  I wonder what effect a United Kingdom withdrawal from Europe would have on Northern Ireland even though there are strong eurosceptic elements in Northern Ireland as well.  There are many other aspects of internal British politics that would be malignly affected by any such move.<\/p><p>  The European Union itself would lose out because my experience in Brussels is that British officials who buy into the European project tend to be some of the most practically minded policy makers one meets in Europe.  Brussels itself would lose out on the manner in which it conducts its business.  A huge number of them would lose their jobs because one cannot work in the Commission unless one is from a state which has membership of the European Union.

It is targeted predominantly at a British audience.<\/p><p>  Regarding Deputy Eric Byrne's comments, legitimacy is not only an issue at European level.  There is a problem of malaise and disillusion with institutions at every level from local democracy to any type of international institution.  Part of me wonders if the sense of a political narrative is gone from politics.  People describe dysfunction in terms that are misleadingly ethical.  A harsh welfare cut is described as a hard choice.  A tax evader is an innovator.  The way in which language is coloured and the way political discourse has been reduced to spin and a game of public relations is hugely damaging to politics.  <\/p><p>  I wish to quote from the late Tony Judt's final book.  In a highly critical piece on political leadership since the 1990s, he stated: \"Convinced there is little they can do, they do little.\"  There is a feeling of impotence and the idea that politics has been superseded by unaccountable elements, whether that be from financial institutions or, even at European level, the technocratic image of the European Commission and other agencies.  All the members have mandates directly from their constituents but if people believe that is superseded by something that is unaccountable - a mysterious market or a technocratic official - it will damage it.  That is not just a question for people in Brussels; it is a question for every capital across the world.<\/p><p>  On the big strong boys, so to speak, and putting trust in weaker countries, there are mutual interests among smaller states when it comes to certain institutional matters but these have often been superseded by short-term interest.  The smaller triple A countries will go along with the preferences of the larger countries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to personalisation and people needing to see the faces of Commissioners rather than those of UKIP members.  It always helps to be able to put a face to the people who make the decisions that affect their lives.  The point I was trying to make when I discussed the problems of elitism in certain quarters in Brussels, and this is not universal, is that it appears there has been a level of disengagement.  That might be due partly to the fact that in media terms there has not been the evolution of a sufficient European public sphere in the sense that comments can sometimes be made in Brussels and aside from in one's own member state, they will not go back to other people.  Someone from the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament elected from a list in Austria can say something and no one in Ireland will hear about it, unless it is specifically to do with Ireland or is controversial at a wider level.<\/p><p>  In terms of those type of links between national parliaments and the European Parliament, one of the conundrums is that while people are directly answerable to the local electorate, which is positive in terms of democratic legitimacy, there is little incentive to talk about Europe.  When any member is interviewed by journalists as they go about their business here, it will not always be relevant to their overall prospect to talk about Europe.  That is understandable but I do not know how to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071600008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Kitching"},{"type":"speech","time":1373986200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It is proportional representation.

I, along with parents of children with cochlear implants, am here to discuss the topic of bilateral cochlear implantation in Ireland, particularly with regard to children born with hearing loss.   A cochlear implant is a technology that provides people who are born with hearing loss, or who have damaged hearing nerves in their inner ears, through tiny hair-like fibres that transmit sounds into brain waves.  It is implanted into the inner ear and enables people to regain a level of hearing that allows them to speak and to hear what is being said to them.<\/p><p>  Ireland's implant programme was set up in 1995 and is linked to a group of 28 cochlear implant centres located between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK.  The centres are governed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE, medical guidelines.  In 2009 the NICE issued a report that supported the provision of bilateral implantation as a minimum standard for implant recipients.  As of today, Ireland's cochlear implant centre is the only one of the 28 centres that does not provide a bilateral implantation programme.<\/p><p>  The standard practice of bilateral implantation stretches beyond Ireland and across the world.  To put the matter in perspective I shall give an extensive list of some of the countries within Europe that provide a bilateral programme.  These include the UK, Norway, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium and Spain, as well as countries further afield such as Iceland, Australia and the US, and, in particular, as near as Belfast in Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The NICE guideline recommendation in 2009 included a request to review the bilateral programme.  A review was completed in 2012 and its results were issued in April 2013 which favoured a bilateral implantation programme.  The most evident results were in the areas of sound localisation, speech perception and a general higher quality of life.<\/p><p>  Let us consider a child trying to distinguish what his or her teacher is saying in a noisy classroom and, as an adult, moving to a working environment yet still struggling to localise or perceive sounds.  For a child to progress and reach his or her potential, enter employment and give back to the State, a second implant is very important.  The issue is about more than simple hearing.  It is about providing these children with the opportunity to reach their potential, integrate into mainstream society and make a positive contribution to the State.<\/p><p>  The April results highlighted the urgency with which second implants should be provided.  Children will gain the greatest benefit if they receive a second implant within the first four to five years.  That is critical because the hearing nerve must be stimulated.  A single implant stimulates the hearing nerve on one side but the hearing nerve on the other side may become redundant.  The benefit to be gained from a second implant within four to five years reduces with each passing day.  A person can go from an ability to distinguish what people say word for word to just hearing a mumbled sound, so time is of the essence.<\/p><p>  I am speaking here about sequential implants, where one follows the other.  Simultaneous implantation means two implants are provided at the same time.  The easiest thing to do would be to roll out a simultaneous implantation programme and ignore sequential implantation.<\/p><p>  I wish to point out that sequential implants are very important.  At present, 350 children qualify for sequential implantation and it is expected that between 200 and 240 may avail of it.  The remainder fall into a number of different categories.  As I said before, adults may not want a second implant because their window of opportunity has passed and they will not benefit from the procedure.  Time is not on our side.<\/p><p>  On many occasions the lead consultants for cochlear implants in Ireland have requested support for the roll-out of a bilateral programme.  Due to longer waiting lists and an increased number of families involved, parents have voiced their concerns and support.  I am glad to say that the consultants, Dr. Laura Viani and Dr. Gary Norman, together with senior members of the HSE, led by Ms Laverne McGuinness, have engaged positively with parents and have worked  towards a solution.  That is significant because three different parties were involved and conflict can arise when multiple parties are engaged in negotiations.  However, in all of the meetings that we had with the HSE and the consultants, everybody agreed that the programme needs to happen and move forward.<\/p><p>  Following the meetings a business case was compiled based on a report.  The HSE agreed to bring over two specialists from the UK, Professor Gerry O'Donoghue and Ms Julie Brinton, who assisted in the roll-out of the UK and France bilateral programmes.  They have ratified what Irish consultants have said and identified what needs to be done.  The business case has been submitted.  My group has come here today to lend our support.  We want action taken as soon as possible.  We also wish to highlight the urgency of the programme.  The backlog will continue to grow as long as the matter is not addressed.  Staffing levels in Ireland's implant centre are a fifth of those in a comparable implant centre in the UK that covers a similar headcount.  Equipment is being provided by parents through private fund-raising.<\/p><p>  Recently the HSE rolled out the successful newborn hearing test screening that will identify children with hearing loss.  I know how effective the scheme is from personal experience.  My six-week-old daughter was born on a Friday and underwent the newborn hearing test the next day, Saturday.  It is important to follow the test with follow-on care in order to give children an opportunity to move forward and reach their potential.  There is no point in identifying them today but leaving them to enter an inadequate system.<\/p><p>  The solution is simple and everybody wants to reach the same destination.  We need the committee to lend its support to the business case and secure approval and funding in order to allow consultants to get on with what they do best, their job.  There is the statistic that 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents and each child will probably be the first deaf person his or her parents have met.  Therefore, one can be sure those parents will raise this issue continually.  After I leave this office they will be back here knocking on the door.  <\/p><p>  Deafness can happen to anyone.  Little did I know three years ago that I would be seated here to talk about cochlear implants to the committee.  These are normal children with a sensory loss that can be treated.  A cochlear implant is a wonderful piece of technology and the children have an opportunity to receive them.  An implant is a wonderful gift that the Government can provide to children.  I ask the committee to lend its support to the business case and push it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071600003#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shay Kearns"},{"type":"speech","time":1373992200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kearns for his presentation.

I hope the delegation will be able to confirm that the funding is still on track following its meeting with the Minister a short time ago.  We want to be sure that our efforts have complimented those of the delegation.  If it has concerns or fears that it has not had certainty that its needs will be met then the committee needs to reflect on that, and we will.  We must focus on delivering the funding and the business plan as soon as possible. <\/p> <p> The list of questions I had prepared was whether all necessary preparations were in place to ensure the business plan is considered and factored into next year's health budget.  All the indications we have are at least positive.  How is it proposed to deal with the backlog of cases - for example, those who have had a single implant - in addition to the children presenting who will be seeking an implant in both ears simultaneously?  Have the consultants in Beaumont Hospital indicated a sense of how the programme will work?  Are the human resources adequate to cater for the backlog, which I understand will take up to 18 months to deal with?  Given the numbers involved, is that a reasonable timeframe or will it go beyond that?<\/p><p> Have the witnesses any concerns about the resources that will be provided to deal with the backlog in a reasonable period?

I am trying to imagine how long a child must wait for the implant.<\/p><p>  A mailing to members outlined the case of a girl who had an implant which failed and then had to undergo surgery to remove the failed implant and have it replaced with a new one.  This mother spoke of her daughter being traumatised and not allowing her out of sight.  That left her in silence for at best five weeks.  We know that one can only switch on the implant four weeks after surgery.  We also know that a child must readapt to all the sounds, as the electrodes will not hit the exact same point.  What a person may know as the sound of a bouncing ball behind him or her is now a sound that he or she must relearn.  I had not realised that.  I am very conscious that of the children with a single implant, a failed implant or none, many are living in silence.  I would like to hear a more detailed response on this issue.  I am getting more sceptical and I wonder if there is a clear plan to deal with the backlog and ensure the children will get the implants they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071600004#C00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1373992800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

They want to clear the backlog and they feel uncomfortable that best medical practice, as outlined in the medical guidelines, is not being carried out.  There are various options, such as travel and time.  The issue of time is significant, particularly for children.

A question every parent asks is whether this is the best option.  This decision must be based on the information to hand.  Stem cell technology may never get to a point at which it can be offered widely to patients.  Therefore, at the moment, a cochlear implant is the best solution for hearing loss for anybody.
