Members will have received copies of my speaking notes and copies of the report itself have also been provided to the committee.  I am the principal officer for PRSI policy in the Department of Social Protection.  I am accompanied by Patricia Murphy, principal officer for pensions policy, Paul Morrin, principal officer and statistician, Aideen Mooney, assistant principal for PRSI policy, as well as Joanne Roche from KPMG.<\/p><p>  Section 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 requires the Minister for Social Protection to carry out actuarial reviews of the financial condition of the SIF.  The purpose of these reviews is to determine the extent to which the fund may be expected, in the longer term, to meet the demands in respect of payment of benefits and other payments, having regard in particular to the adequacy or otherwise of the contributions.  The review also examines other matters the Minister considers relevant in terms of affecting the current and future financial condition of the fund.  The Minister is obliged to ensure that actuarial reviews are carried out at five-year intervals.  On completion of the review a report is to be provided to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas within six months.<\/p><p>  Following a tendering process, the third actuarial review of the SIF, as of 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.  The review covers a 55-year period from 2011 to 2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 actuarial reviews of the fund.  The scope of the 2010 review was to update the results of the 2005 review taking account of policy, economic and demographic changes, with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as break-even contribution rates.  The review also considered the effects of various policy options, existing Government commitments and planned reforms.<\/p><p>  The SIF is the core of the social insurance system.  Social insurance, or PRSI, contributions from employers and employees are paid into the fund to finance a broad range of short- and long-term social insurance benefits for employees.  A lower rate of PRSI is paid by the self-employed into the fund, which provides them with access to long-term social insurance benefits.  The long-term schemes cater for retirement, survivor and maternity benefits, while the principal contingencies covered by the short-term schemes are illness, incapacity, unemployment and maternity.<\/p><p>  The fund operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the Exchequer acting as the residual financier where there is a shortfall between PRSI contributions received and the cost of social insurance benefits paid.  Exchequer subvention was the norm for over 40 years up to 1997.  For example, in 1985 the Exchequer contribution was almost 29% of SIF expenditure.  However, no Exchequer contribution was required over the period 1997 to 2009, inclusive.  In 2008, the current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit when expenditure exceeded income by &euro;255 million.  In 2010, the need for Exchequer subvention arose for the first time since 1996 as the surplus carried forward from previous years was eliminated.  The Revised Estimates for the Department provide for a deficit of nearly &euro;1.82 billion in 2012.<\/p><p>  The report of the 2010 actuarial review projects the financial sustainability of the fund based on a set of agreed assumptions and a series of projections of the fund's income and expenditure for the period 2011-66.  While the effective date for the review is 31 December 2010, the review took account of budgetary and legislative changes affecting benefit and contribution levels, particularly the range of changes provided for in the national pensions framework. <\/p><p>  While, as stated by the consultants, long-term projections by their very nature are unlikely to be borne out in practice, the report emphasises the trends which emerge over the period.  In terms of sensitivity, the results presented, when expressed as a percentage of GNP, are not particularly sensitive to alterations in macro-economic variables.  The projections presented are, however, particularly sensitive to the approach used to index benefit payments by reference to either national average earnings or the consumer price index and the future population profile, which is affected by increasing life expectancy, fertility rates and migration flows.<\/p> <p> I will now cover the findings of projected shortfalls in the review.  In the absence of any action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The provisional 2011 deficit of &euro;1.5 billion will double to &euro;3 billion by 2019 and will have increased to &euro;25.7 billion by 2066.  These figures refer to the projected annual deficit in the particular year in question.  The figure quoted recently in the media of &euro;324 billion refers to the sum of all annual deficits up to 2066, expressed in current terms, assuming no action is taken.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the shortfall is projected to increase from 1.1% of GNP in 2011 to 2% in 2019.  It will further increase to 6.4% of GNP in 2052 before gradually reducing to 5.7% by 2066.<\/p><p> In the absence of reductions in expenditure levels or increases in PRSI income beyond those planned changes to May 2012, which have been factored into the projections, significant Exchequer subvention will be required to meet ongoing expenditure requirements.  Exchequer subventions will need to more than treble from 2011 levels by 2030 and increase by a factor of almost eight by 2040.<\/p><p> There are various drivers of changed fund outlook.  The main driver of the increase in overall projected expenditure is pension related expenditure.  This is attributable, to a large extent, to the projected aging of the population over the 55-year period.  Another factor contributing to the projected expenditure increase is increased labour force participation with consequential increased numbers qualifying for a contributory State pension and at higher rates.  This is mitigated to some extent by the 2012 changes to the qualification conditions and payment rate bands and by further changes to be incorporated under the national pensions framework outlined in the appendix.<\/p><p> In recent years there has been a significant increase in expenditure associated with short-term schemes.  This is influenced significantly by the poor economic environment which has severely affected PRSI contribution income.  In the longer term when the economy is projected to return to a more stable and typical scenario, it is anticipated that these financial pressures will dissipate owing to reduced numbers accessing these short-term schemes in the future.<\/p><p> In the medium to long term, pension-related expenditure is projected to become the predominant component of fund expenditure.  Long-term pension-related expenditure will increase from 57% of total expenditure in 2011 to 85% in 2066.  The significant increase in pension-related expenditure is attributable to Ireland's rapidly altering population structure and in particular the large increase in the over 65 year old population.  The over 65 years cohort is projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and further to 24% in 2060.<\/p><p> Simultaneously the pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over 65 in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060.  The pensioner support ratio relates to the number of people of working age from 20 to 64 relative to those over the pension age of 65.<\/p><p> I will address the value for money indicators.  The value-for-money findings on a range of individual scenarios are consistent with those of the 2005 actuarial review.  The principal categories for which social insurance offers better value for money are: those on the lower part of the income distribution; those with shorter contribution histories; and the self-employed.  For those at the higher end of the income distribution, the fund is redistributive and these individuals generally get back less than they pay in.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for inviting us here today.  My colleagues and I would be very happy to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348132200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy for the detailed report.  I have not dealt with these reports as they have been made every five years in the past.  Ms Kennedy said that significant Exchequer intervention would be required in the future unless certain things happened.  One of them is obviously a reduction in expenditure and the other is an increase in PRSI contributions.  Given the condition of the country at the moment an increase in PRSI funding is quite difficult because people are not working and businesses are struggling.  One of the key ways to address some of the problems with the fund is to return to the near full employment of the Celtic tiger years.  Am I correct in saying that even if that happened there would still be a shortfall in the future and there is a need for substantial changes to the contribution from businesses in the long term?  The sustainability of the fund needs to be addressed with more extensive action, part of which Ms Kennedy has addressed here.  For instance, last year the Government reduced some of the employers' PRSI contributions which seems to be contrary to a need to ensure the fund was getting at least as much as it is as present.<\/p><p>  Do we need comprehensive tax reform in order to increase the Exchequer take from income tax and PRSI?  What is the suggestion on employers?  When compared with other European countries, Ireland's PRSI rate seems quite low.  We have the standard rate of 10.7% and the lower rate of 4.25%, whereas in Austria it is 21%, Belgium's is more than 30% and it is also higher in Finland.  Is Ms Kennedy suggesting that we need to go to that level?  Unless the cost of living reduced substantially I do not believe anyone could suggest reducing the amount people get in return - the expenditure element - unless there is any other aspect to expenditure that could be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092000004#C00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348132200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The purpose of the report is to supply all the information necessary to make decisions.

I would like to take the time to study it in detail.  I will speak from a more practical point of view.  Some people were against the changes made to pensions this year and voiced their opposition to them, but I thought it was good because I found that someone who worked for ten years and made PRSI and tax contributions but did not work for the following 40 years and drew unemployment payments and got a credit stamp was entitled to exactly the same pension as somebody who worked for 47 years and contributed regularly.  I agree with the changes made and I believe that if people who do not pay as much do not get as much back it will ease the burden a little.<\/p><p>  I have dealt with many self-employed people who find themselves in dire circumstances.  They tell me they would have no problem paying an A rate of PRSI so they could avail of the benefits if they needed them.  Has bringing the self-employed into the contributions net at the same rate as PAYE workers been considered?  This would mean the benefits would be available to them also when the time came.  From what was stated, it seems a subvention from the Exchequer was the norm for 40 years and it was only during the bubble that the subvention was not needed.  Obviously we need to revert to the subvention.  We cannot apologise for this because it always was the norm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092000005#D00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348132800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>One of the items the report examined was extending other benefits to the self-employed, and the report gives costings and the level of contribution that would be required if one were to provide jobseeker's benefit or invalidity pension to self-employed people.

As contained in the request for tenders, the measure of the risk of poverty was the survey of income and living conditions.  According to our observation, the current rate of the contributory State pension, some &euro;11,976 per annum, is above the risk of poverty threshold of &euro;10,831 per annum.  Given that our base case assumes the pension will keep pace with earnings growth, the pension should remain above the threshold, which has been defined as 60% of median income.  Section 10 contains a number of figures and tables that set out the scenarios.  For example, table 10.3 provides a good example of the CPI link.<\/p><p>  We considered uprating the pension as high as 40% of national average earnings.

When one looks at the ethos of credit unions, they are very much voluntary and democratic, and not for profit.  The ethos is that they want to part of and give back to the community.  They do not want their money sitting in the large financial institutions that make millions of euro for speculators.  How important is that aspect in this legislation?

In the context of our dealings with banks and credit unions, we are obviously dealing with a large number of distressed borrowers at present.  We have a debt management protocol in place in respect of voluntary arrangements.  We have been involved in working with members of the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, on this in recent years.  We have now extended this protocol to the utilities.  We are in discussions with the credit union movement at present with regard to putting in place a similar protocol in respect of its members.

I know from the figures I receive from the Department of Finance that many managers at senior level, including some of the most senior people in Anglo Irish Bank, continue to be employed by their institutions.  At the last count, 22 out of the top 50 people were still employed.  It is amusing for them to ask for the same type of regulation to be applied to a voluntary, democratic and not-for-profit organisation, where directors are not remunerated in return for the time they contribute to ensuring their communities receive a dividend.  I find this surprising and I do not understand why the IBF has come forward with this suggestion.  Is it a lack of understanding of how the credit union movement works or is it that it wants the credit unions to become banks?  One of the failings of the existing legislation is the lack of understanding of the unique ethos of the credit union movement.

Certainly the role of the auditors in auditing the banks in recent years is something that could be called into question and could be the subject of a separate inquiry given that they failed to highlight the risks that were clearly building up in the banking system.  In the case of financial institutions and credit unions, the bottom line is the risk to members.  We need to ensure that all of these bodies are being operated effectively and that members are protected.

She has not given us her opinion of the legislation in her written documentation so perhaps the organisation does not have an opinion on this.  The legislation deals with a three-tiered strategy based on asset size.  As a result, there will be different requirements and governance in respect of the credit union and tiers one, two and three.  There is a two-tier structure in the other part of the island under the SFA but it is based on risk and complexity.  One of the arguments put forward at the meeting of the committee yesterday concerned the best approach.  Should we be looking at a tier structure under asset size alone so that one has the same type of regulations for a smaller, highly risky credit union with the same asset base or one with low-risk products but in a large urban area so it has a large asset base?

We would like more detail in the legislation around how this would be put together, in particular on the risk weighting of assets.  The main assets in credit unions would be loans, investments and fixed assets.  We believe that if there was more detail embodied in the legislation it would provide a safeguard for credit unions that there might be caps in particular areas and different capital requirements which apply to different types of assets.<\/p> <p>That would give us something we could work with.

We have no issue with such concentration of lending, as they are easy to implement.  We have no difficulty with a straight restriction in a particular area.<\/p><p>  It is different if the concentration of lending gets a bit more detailed and takes in a term like \"per employer\".  There is a definition in the Credit Union Act 1997 of \"family or connected party\" and there have been previous issues with the Central Bank in the restriction of lending based on a connected party.  There have been difficulties in that definition.  To take the definition of a \"connected party\" in the Credit Union Act 1997 and implement a lending restriction based on it would be very difficult because it is so broad.  It would take in a spouse, partners, first cousins or grandmothers.  If the Central Bank imposed a restriction of lending on that basis, it would be very difficult for us to say that if a person's first cousin got a loan last week, the person in question cannot get one this week.  There is a practical element in that regard.  We have no difficulty in terms of restrictions on size or particular classes of loans.

Our fear is that if the restrictions are continually tightened, it will affect our income on an ongoing basis.

On the issue of levies, the draft scheme provides for three separate levies.  What will be the impact of that provision on Mr. Hosford's credit union in terms of its viability?  There is a concern that levies are open-ended and that there is no indication of a likely liability.  It could result in some credit unions becoming non-viable.  This is separate to the restructuring and consolidation that will inevitably happen within the sector.<\/p><p>  I am interested in the different perspectives contained in the submissions.  We will deal with the submission from Mr. Owens, in respect of St. Mary's, presently.  Mr. Hosford appears to be taking a positive view of the Bill and saying he does not see a major difficulty for the operation and governance of the Gurranabraher Credit Union whereas the representatives from St. Mary's Credit Union are saying the Bill will strangle the life out of credit unions and that there is no attempt to preserve that which is good about credit unions.  These are different perspectives and perhaps that is related to the circumstances of individual credit unions.  Perhaps that will emerge over the course of our discussions.<\/p><p>  Regarding term limits, what practical difficulties will it cause if the credit unions must rotate board members along the lines proposed in the general scheme of the Bill?  Will it cause direct difficulties for Mr. Hosford's credit union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000011#M00700","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348135800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Regarding the board and its rotation, we do not see any difficulty.  The board is quite happy with the fact that the term of a director is limited to nine years and the term of executives is limited to three years.  The view of the board is that governance is essential and best practice is very important.  It is a voluntary position and if one has completed nine years it may be time for someone else to take on the mantle.  People on the board are voluntary directors.  The credit union should not be their top priority in life and if one gives nine years of one's life, perhaps one has done enough.  It is a time-consuming role.  Nine years is enough and perhaps we should allow others to come in and take on the mantle.<\/p><p>  The board does not have an issue with the rotation of the executive positions on the board.  In certain credit unions, the chairman has been the same person for 25 years.  That is not to say that the person is not very capable but it is not best practice to have the same person as chair of the board for that length of time.  The board has taken the view that this is a positive step.  One is not precluded from being involved if one is not a director.<\/p><p>  Another question concerns the impact of the levies.  As a larger credit union, this year we have a surplus of &euro;2 million and levies may amount to 10% or 20% of the operating surplus.  It is a more serious situation if a credit union does not have a surplus as the imposition of levies could push a credit union into deficit.  Difficulties arise in this situation because the credit union must use its reserves, which affects its capital levels.<\/p><p>  Regarding the overall perspective, different credit unions have different views and size is a major factor.  We are not a very big credit union, with &euro;85 million in total assets and 16,000 members.

One of the issues credit unions have had is that because they have only offered one loan, big ticket items, such as home improvements and car loans, have got mixed in with the day-to-day borrowing requirements.  The consequence of that is that if one borrows for a car loan and six months later one requires a small Christmas loan, a holiday loan or whatever, that all gets mixed into the one loan so, effectively, one is putting short term credit over a longer period of time.  We would see this as a safeguard for people that they are separating out their short term needs from their long-term needs.  The safeguard would be that there would have to be a limit which could only be increased if one did a full review of the account.

We can discuss the broad philosophy in the draft but he goes as far as saying the Bill makes no attempt to preserve what is good about credit unions or to enshrine their ethos in legislation.  He is concerned the ethos is undermined by draft legislation and it reproduces a standard banking model that is not appropriate.  He agrees, however, that a transparent regulatory system is required and targets should be set out but that is not what the Bill does.  The governance standards required are not appropriate to credit unions and should not be the same standard as those applied to multinational financial institutions.  Mr. Owens also expresses concern about volunteerism being threatened by some of the provisions of the draft scheme and about the requirement for credit unions to merge.  His advice is the entire legislative process should be postponed for 12 months because it is being rushed.<\/p><p>  I want to dispose of the specific points as well but I wanted to make sure we put this in context because Mr. Owens is critical.

The regulation should be linked to risk and asset base is only one measure of risk.  The more assets that a credit union has, if they go bad, the greater the damage, as we have seen in the country in general.  That is not the only measure of risk but to bring that aspect into the legislation, the present tiers, as suggested by the commission, particularly that between &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million, are much too broad.  A credit union with assets of &euro;12 million is a different operation from a credit union like that of Mr. McConville, with &euro;90 million in assets.  St. Mary's parish credit union has &euro;49 million in assets so we are in the middle.  We feel that it is fine for credit unions up to &euro;10 million, but there should then be tiers of &euro;10 million to &euro;30 million, &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million, &euro;60 million to &euro;100 million and then over &euro;100 million.

A credit union with an asset base of &euro;49 million might not have the resources to offer some of the services the larger credit unions could offer but we are going to be subject to the same level of regulatory interaction as them.<\/p><p>  Even from the regulator's point of view, it makes sense to have tighter bands.  We would suggest the regulator has already embraced this concept with the prism model that has been introduced for regulation of all institutions in the country, which categorises financial institutions according to the level of risk they pose to the national economy and regulates them accordingly.  They have already embraced the concept in their overall operations and we are saying it should be embraced for credit unions, which should be regulated according to tighter bands.<\/p> <p>There are two or three other issues.

To make a comparison, a qualified accountant will contribute much more to an accountancy firm than a trainee accountant.  As one develops, one becomes more involved in the role.  We must remember that credit union volunteers would be prized in other organisations that are looking for volunteers.

The regulator will have absolutely no engagement with that person because it will not recognise him or her.  The fact that credit unions are about and start with their members has been lost in all of this.  We have a serious concern that members are being sidelined during the rush to ensure this legislation is put through on time, which is being done to meet other requirements.  That is why we are concerned about the removal of the direct link between the member and the finances of the credit union.  I could present the accounts at an AGM without a problem, as I deal with them every day.  I am well aware of all the accounts and could answer all the questions members would have.  Perhaps that would be seen as a good thing in some cases.  We certainly believe that by electing a board to run the credit union on their behalf, the members are imposing certain duties on them.  The most important thing for a credit union is its finances.  That is the most important thing the board of a credit union is charged with running.  We understand there is an official view that all the directors of a credit union are equally responsible for its finances.  There is a concern that if one director was nominated to take sole responsibility for the finances of a credit union, it might give the other directors the \"get out of jail\" card of saying \"it is the treasurer's job and nothing to do with me.\"  We do not believe that is the case in the existing structures, or will be the case in any future structure.

As the meeting proceeds, I am learning a great deal about issues affecting the movement.  I have great sympathy for the views being expressed by Mr. Owens.  If I understand his argument correctly, the one-size-fits-all approach to credit unions, which essentially amounts to over-regulation, could undermine the fundamentally democratic ethos of the movement.  That is a compelling argument.<\/p><p>  On the question as to whom we trust to regulate the credit unions, I am happy to have the State step in and regulate the banks much more thoroughly than was previously the case.  It appears, however, that the credit unions are about to suffer a backlash arising from what the banks did when they were not subject to regulation.  Despite not being guilty of the types of reckless behaviour in which the banks engaged, the credit unions are being placed under serious threat.  While it is preferable that the State regulates the banks rather than having the banks regulating or failing to regulate themselves, as was previously the case, I would prefer the credit union members rather than the State to regulate credit unions because I trust the former more than the latter to perform this function.  I need to be convinced of the need to regulate credit unions or permit the State to interfere in them in such a way that may undermine the democratic control of the membership.  I am very sympathetic to that point of view.  The arguments made by Mr. Owens are extremely compelling. <\/p><p>  The other issue that appears to arise is size.  This is partly an issue of defending the principle of members exerting democratic control over their credit unions.  However, it also appears to be the case that a different perspective is taken depending on the size of the credit union in question.  I have sympathy on the need to address the issue of conflicts of interest because it is one which arises.  Again, however, are credit union members not the best people to decide on this matter?  If there is a potential conflict of interest, I presume the issue can be raised by members at the annual general meeting.  Are members not the most appropriate people to make a decision on such matters?  If one chooses not to allow members to make such decisions, it may not be a major problem for larger credit unions which have larger pools of people but in smaller credit unions it could have the inadvertent effect of hampering their ability to function because they cannot draw on a sufficiently large pool of individuals to allow them to engage in rotation.  The point about maintaining experienced people in the credit union is a valid argument because one must build up skills and knowledge.  I am also sympathetic to the idea that ordinary people can decide to elect people who they believe to be competent and those who they elect can then educate and train themselves in the relevant area and build up a skills base. <\/p><p>  Does Mr. Owens agree that the credit unions are suffering a backlash arising from the actions of the banks?  The irony is that the credit unions could become more like banks as a result, which is the last thing we need.  We need the credit union model to continue because credit unions provide the type of financial services we need as opposed to the chaos we had in the for-profit banking sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000016#R01400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1348139400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Kevin Humphreys.

The credit union managed by Mr. Owens is at a figure of &euro;47 million, while those of his colleagues are approaching the figure of &euro;100 million.  The State has a responsibility to regulate this sector.  A small number of quite large community credit unions have run into difficulty owing to the lack of regulation.  As colleagues have said, we need a clean sweep.  There is a role for regulation.

Based on the comments and submissions made yesterday and today, particularly by the two larger credit unions, there is broad support for the Bill and its motivation.  The focus of discussion is on a small number of sections.  It will be interesting to see if our guests argue or make incendiary comments such as that the Bill is a \"backlash against what has happened\" or \"endangering the credit union movement.\"  The motivation of the Bill is to protect the credit union movement; it is certainly not a backlash as suggested yesterday when it was said that at the end of this process, the 3 million credit union members would be out on the streets with placards.  That will not happen.<\/p><p>  One of the issues raised yesterday by the Irish League of Credit Unions which we have not yet discussed was the issue of social finance.  While there are disputes between the ILCU, managers and the other association about tiers and regulations and for how long people can serve on boards, it appears there is no real argument against allowing credit unions lend money for social benefit projects guaranteed by the State.  This proposal from the ILCU has huge merit.  Is there a reason clubs seeking sports capital are precluded from applying for credit union loans?  Many clubs applying for sports capital are getting some money from the State, using some of their own money and borrowing the rest.  However, they are precluded from applying to credit unions.  Why is that?  Should the Credit Union Bill be amended to allow Government-backed schemes to become customers of credit unions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000017#S00400","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1348139400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>There is no question but that volunteers have played a huge role in the credit union movement and that it is very important that we protect them.

With regard to the role and responsibilities of the treasurer, as Mr. Owens said, the credit union movement has changed during the years and the treasurer's role was defined when credit unions were at a different stage of development and most did not have professional staff.  However, that is no longer the case.  It might be said credit unions have become victims of their own huge success.  The same has happened with regard to the role of manager during the years.  Clarity must be provided and the role must be defined clearly in order that in the overall framework of corporate governance we have accountability and responsibility.  Treasurers and managers must also be accountable to credit union members.  It is important that the roles of manager and treasurer are clearly considered, defined and provided for in the Bill.

There has been much talk about democratic control.  To give the committee some context here, we have 16,000 members but only 160 turned up to our annual general meeting last year.  In essence, only 1% of our membership turned up to vote.  We are struggling with democratic control ourselves.

Even after that, they can still be involved in the credit union in other roles, even if they are not elected members of the board.<\/p><p>  On the issue of restructuring, the reason the credit unions have survived so well in recent years is that we are all independent, limited companies.

However, restructuring is required.  Our view is that disorderly restructuring could cause difficulties.  The Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, and the provisions being set up there will facilitate orderly restructuring, which will provide the mechanisms for the credit union movement to be more sustainable into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Hosford"},{"type":"speech","time":1348140000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McConville, Mr. Hosford and Mr. Owens for contributing to the discussion.

I perceive there is an underlying and fundamental risk and vulnerability present in the credit union movement and I am not satisfied that this has been fully addressed, possibly, by the work of the commission.  I am a little concerned about the extent to which it is reflected in the heads of the Bill.  To put it succinctly, my suggestion is that the emphasis is on capital adequacy and a position is set for a minimum reserves amount - there is no real maximum amount but an optimum amount is suggested.  My point is that a small credit union which does not have even 7% of reserves but with a very broad and diverse saver base, in our experience in our work, seems to be in a stronger position than even a very large credit union that suffers from a savings concentration, even when that larger credit union has a good degree of capital adequacy of 10% of reserves or greater.

Sometimes the best way to strengthen a credit union is to allow it to shrink rather than grow.  If a credit union gets itself into the situation where it has excessive amounts of surplus funds for which it does not have loan demand, then there are a couple of dangers which are immediately obvious.  One danger is that it becomes some sort of savings or investment club.  At the time of the foundation of credit unions, the credit union movement pioneers expressed grave and justified  concerns about the development of two classes of credit union members.  Today we have three classes of credit union members.<\/p><p>  I will elaborate on that point.  There is a very large number of members with very little savings who tend to do very little or no borrowing.  The middle group consists of the borrowing cohort with typically, modest levels of savings but doing the bulk, if not all, of the borrowing.  The tiny group - I have set 3% as a good bar for understanding the extent of the problem - are at the other side of the graph.  The examples I have cited are focused on 3% of members holding 33% and greater of the assets of the credit unions.  Those present who are credit union personnel and those who are familiar with credit unions will know well that this is setting the bar quite low, actually.  Even if one applies that 3% as a starting point, there are potentially 3 million members, notionally, in the credit union movement - we will not talk about that today, hopefully.  If one takes that 3 million membership as an example, it means that approximately 90,000 people between them are responsible for upwards of &euro;3 billion.  That is a risk which, in my view, has not been fully understood, identified or addressed but we are aware of it through our work.  We undertake this fundamental analysis with every credit union we work with. To put that in context, we have worked with upwards of 60 credit unions over the past ten years in this frame and at this technical level.  Therefore, I think we have credibility in raising the flag on this issue.  As to how the problem is to be addressed, it must be accepted that if credit unions are to be understood and accepted as voluntary member-owned and member-run organisations, then there are great swathes of things they must be allowed to self-determine.  However, if they are to be allowed to do that, then in effect, we are asking them to set their own appetite for risk.  By setting their appetite for risk, in turn, this will trigger the degree of regulation and supervision that is required to protect the savings of not only the small group of people but all the members and also the functioning of the credit union for the very large number of group of members who do not own the wealth but are in dire need of the services. <\/p><p>  We advise that starting with self-determination, they should be allowed to set the appetite for risk,that they should be regulated and supervised accordingly and a very good weather eye is kept on how things progress.  By all means, credit unions should be required to operate within certain intelligent parameters.  I would dearly love if we had the opportunity to sit down the people who set these things and suggest some of those parameters, based on our experience but I do not know if that can happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000020#V00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1348140600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Another way of putting it is that this would be setting a limit on the growth of credit unions.

Alex Laidlaw is a credit union guru and I will paraphrase his advice.  He advised credit unions not to grow for the sake of growing either; to keep it realistic to the needs and wants of the members in the bond.  I will list the very simple ways this problem can be addressed.  One way is to remind the credit unions, in a gentle but persuasive manner, that only part of their job is to make funds available for access to credit.  I refer to section 6, subsections (<i>a<\/i>) to (<i>g<\/i>) of the Credit Union Act 1997, which lists the objectives of credit unions and refers to their remit to educate people about the wise use of credit.  The big aspect in the commission's report and the heads of the Bill which we tend not to talk about too much is the promotion of thrift.  I know this is deeply unfashionable and untrendy but I am unapologetic.  We cannot make people better off or more financially independent or autonomous by lending them money.  This can actually become more dependent if we continue to lend them money.  The only way to make people better off is by increasing their store of wealth and their autonomy, by them having savings.  That is the other half of the job.  It is not a question that we are worried about cutting the big savers out of the picture; we are quite happy to keep the big savers, Chairman, but what we would like to do is to give credit unions sufficient operational flexibility to allow them to create and craft products that incentivise savings.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of time but I will give an example.  Many people are bringing their debt problems to the credit unions.  They want to get better value from the credit union than they currently get from other lenders.  Those loans are seen as quite risky and they necessarily need to be approached with a degree of caution.  We could craft a product that allows us to charge, for example, the 12% allowed by law - the normal percentage for that credit union rate of charge might be 9%, these are all nominal figures, not APRs, to keep it simple.  If we decide this is a debt loan which is riskier - it is a debt consolidation - we will recognise that fact and we will price in the risk, something the Central Bank has been encouraging us to do for a long time.  We will charge 12%.  If that loan is repaid correctly over the full period the difference between the 12% we have charged and the 9% we would have liked to charge, will be owned by the member by way of savings.  Instead of giving it as a loan interest rebate at the end of the year, it is given as a lump sum - complete with any accrued interest or dividend that would have happened in the meantime - to the member for his or her own use.  By the same token, if the member has not repaid the loan in the correct manner and there is a problem of arrears or delinquency of some sort, then the credit union retains those funds and writes them off against the outstanding principal on the loan.  That is a simple solution and not difficult from an operational perspective but that would need to be enabled in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000020#V00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1348140600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I am sure members will have questions about that.  If I may ask a question on the other net issue, the proposed amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997, in respect of the permission to withdraw one's savings.  As I read it that is a proposal to liberalise the position, in a sense, compared to where matters currently stand.  I believe Ms Motherway has a concern about that.  I ask her to tell us about the proposal and then to state her concern.  I think I am right in how I have described it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000020#V00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348141200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Yes, although I can see how it seems counterintuitive for somebody like me to be concerned about this.  As it stands, where a credit union member wishes to withdraw his or her savings, the latter are held, notionally and in most cases actually, against any outstanding loan.  The member must apply to the board for permission to withdraw and permission may be granted up to a level of 25% of the contingent liability, that is, the member's own liability or any guarantee for which he or she is responsible.  The proposal in the heads of the Bill is to remove that requirement in order that, in effect, a member can withdraw shares that are put into play after the loan is issued.  In other words, the shares at the time the loan is issued may be attached to the loan and cannot be withdrawn, although anything that comes in afterwards may be.  Our concern in this regard is that a relatively liberal arrangement is being exchanged for something more restrictive.  Take, for example, a person who owes &euro;4,000 in principal and has &euro;6,000 in shares.  The loan, in other words, is covered and everybody is happy.  Under the existing arrangement, if the member needs access to these funds, he or she can request a withdrawal up to 25% of the contingent liability.  Under the new proposal, however, the shares attached to the loan at the time of issue cannot be withdrawn.  That is a cause of concern to us.<\/p><p>  Our second concern is slightly more esoteric.  As I said, part of our job is to promote and incentivise savings in order that people can build a store of wealth and thus live more independently.  The credit union does so by encouraging a model of saving while borrowing which facilitates members in setting aside even modest amounts in savings at the same time as they are repaying a loan.  The proposed prohibition in terms of attaching shares to the existing outstanding loan balance removes the credit union's capacity to mitigate risk and could hinder it in doing its job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000021#W00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1348141200,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for attending.  Ms Motherway has made several interesting observations.  On the issue of the funding imbalance, if I am correctly interpreting what she is saying, the risk is essentially one of an over-concentration of the deposit base among a relatively small percentage of savers.  There are clearly risks inherent in this because if these savers move their money out, the funding base is undermined.  Likewise, the loan-to-deposit ratio at an overall level within the credit union would be impacted upon.  Are there controls or rules governing this situation as it stands?<\/p><p>  Ms Motherway expressed the view that a small credit union with a low level of reserves might be in a better position than its larger counterpart with large capital reserves but an over-concentration of depositors.  That is an interesting observation.  However, the function of the reserves is to act as a buffer for absorbing losses and any bad debts that might emerge.  There is an increasing trend in that regard.  Surely, therefore, depleted reserves present a greater risk than an over-dependence on savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000021#W00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348141200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The other factor that comes into play is liquidity.  Where there is this type of savings concentration, a credit union must watch the liquidity position very carefully, but that is not reflected strongly enough in the heads of the Bill.  To the best of my knowledge, the main control in this regard is the requirement under the existing Act that one member cannot have more than 1% of the assets of a credit union as shares or deposits.  The issue is the difference between 1% of a small number and 1% of a large number.  Consider an example of what the commission referred to as a medium-sized credit union with, for example, 35,000 members which amounts to a large member base in itself but &euro;100 million in assets which places it squarely in the middle of the range.  While, for instance, 3% of the member base amounts to some 1,050 members, the restriction means they can hold up to &euro;33 million out of a total asset base of &euro;100 million.  That is the degree of concentration about which we are talking.  In the case of a credit union with fewer members, say, 30,000 but more than &euro;200 million in assets, the corresponding figures would be some 900 members accounting for approximately &euro;66 million.  This is an actual as opposed to a potential problem which represents a grave underlying risk.<\/p><p>  The question then arises as to how to address a situation where a credit union with smaller reserves might apparently be in a stronger position than a counterpart with greater reserves.  From an operational perspective, we spend a large portion of our time seeking to assist credit unions to ensure they are compliant.  It is not a very difficult task because most of them perform well in this regard.  The bottom line, however, is that if there is a savings concentration problem, even if the union is very liquid, and if a sufficiently large chunk of the money wants to move, that credit union is in trouble.  In fact, its capital reserves would not even come into play in that scenario and this is where we see the main risk.  A factor to consider in this regard is that while one might assume it is older people who have worked and saved hard all their lives who hold most of the shares, our analysis shows that, in fact, the greater portion of members are people at the upper end of the economically active age bracket, that is, workers in the 45 to 60 years age bracket.  Without wishing to be indelicate, the problem gets worse over time as members start to die.  There is no guarantee that the next generation of a member's family will retain his or her money within the credit union.  There are several good products on the market - I hate to advertise them - offering wonderful returns, notably the Exchequer-type products from An Post.  If part of the job of a credit union is to do the best for its members, it could well be argued that we should be advising members who have a great deal of money invested with us that they could be getting a far better return elsewhere.  In other words, if we do our job properly, we will make the problem worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000021#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carmel Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1348141200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Ms Motherway referred to the difference in interest rates.

In the case of a debt consolidation loan, for instance, where a person is paying an interest rate of 16% or 18% on a credit card debt, he or she will make an immediate gain by transferring that debt to the credit union.  In some cases, however, people are paying lower rates on a portion of their outstanding debt such as mortgage-type debt at 6%, 5% or even better, or car loans from finance sources at 8%, 7% or even better.  One must always look at the individual's repayment capacity and never go beyond it.<\/p><p>  We generally seek to avoid stretching out a loan over time because doing so incurs a greater cost of credit for the member.  He or she might be paying less interest but over a longer period of time, it will stack up.  In essence, we seek to balance two imperatives in our work.  On the one hand, we have the credit union ethos which obliges us to look after members and avoid making loans that are not good for them.  On the other, there is the practical and business sustainability side.  One can be ethical until the cows come, but if one's operations are not sustainable, one is in trouble.  That is the balancing act in which we are constantly engaged.  We must set the rate at a level which makes sense for the broad membership and the particular member.  When a member is sitting across from us requesting assistance, he or she is the only member in the world.

I arrived during a very interesting part of Ms Motherway's presentation when she was referring to solvency, the spread, stickiness and depth of the deposit, etc.  The credit union movement began as a mutual savings framework for, effectively, lending on an unsecured basis.  In those early days, the banks tended to be the province of wealthy people and businesses.  I refer to landed people, those who owned assets or businesses and individuals with cheque accounts in this regard.  Then there were the building societies, which were the mutual, long-term saving and borrowing institutions.  The next cog in the machine of finance was the credit union movement.  Credit unions understood the working capital requirements - short-term and unsecured in nature - of households.<\/p><p>  The economy has developed and we have moved through inflation, deflation and stagflation.  All those contexts determine whether there is a viability for the sectors - banking, mortgage-lending on a mutual basis or credit union lending and saving - to which I refer.  The risks relating to funding these organisations have changed as a result of the maturities of the funding sources and the breadth of what is involved.  Ms Motherway made a very good point in respect of the generational stickiness of the money.  At present, &euro;66 million is held by 900 customers.  That is &euro;75,000 each.  As Ms Motherway indicated, these individuals are probably in their retirement years and are not seeking competitive advantage in the context of the return on their investments.  A vulnerability exists in this regard because &euro;66 million is a shockingly large proportion of an overall deposit base of &euro;200 million that is funding the short-term, unsecured loans to which I refer.  That is both the problem that exists and the reality which needs to be expressed in order to get the relevant framework and legal and regulatory mechanisms in place in order to govern this area of activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000022#X01100","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348141800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I completely agree.

If, however, it is felt that there is a need to merge them, then this should at least be done in an organised and controlled manner in order that the credit unions involved can be encouraged to address the savings or funding imbalance prior to any merger taking place.  It is probably our primary concern that the ReBo work would kick in and that this might happen without anybody becoming fully aware of that underlying vulnerability.

Deputy Donohoe's second question relates to self-determination in the context of risk appetites.  He needs to get ready for this: we have these instruments called credit policies.  The credit policy of a credit union, its share policy and some joined-up thinking in the context of the credit control or collections policy are what constitute the risk appetite of that credit union.  Effectively, certain things suggested in the heads of the Bill would go into that territory and would reduce the flexibility credit unions currently have in the context of setting their credit policies.  As a result of the fact that we can only deal with those who are members of the co-op and because of our operating forum's co-operative structure, there should be some degree of comfort for the members of this committee, as legislators, in that the knock-on effects are confined to that co-op in the event of its failing.  However, I would be the first to agree with what the Central Bank is doing on the prism side of things in the context of its reference to impact of a failure, even at a low-risk firm.  There are may low-risk firms and they will not have that big an impact.  There are only 400 or so credit unions and everybody involved with them knows everyone else.  One of them has a big impact.

At present, this service is realised on a paper-based medium.  In other words, if a member goes to his or her credit union and hands over &euro;2, he or she will get a paper savings stamp in return.  We have been made aware of a number of issues in this regard, including loss and theft of savings stamps, a risk in the context of fraud and money laundering and the lack of an audit trail.  At present, there is no information which links a member to any stamp which he or she purchases.<\/p> <p> In regard to the savings service as a whole, we as a company have taken it from a paper-based medium to a digital medium.  Instead of members getting a paper-based stamp, they get a tamper-proof card and information on it is linked to the database.  From a loss or theft point of view, the card cannot be copied.  For example, if I were to lose my card, a photograph is linked to it if it were to be handed into the credit union and there is also PIN protection on it.  Therefore, those provisions solve those two issues.<\/p><p> In terms of fraud and money laundering, some paper-based stamps are issued from a machine in the banking hall, which removes staff from being involved in that service and there are no controls in place in that respect.  If I were to purchase such stamps in the credit union, there would be a lack of an audit trail.  I do not have a member number in that respect and there is not a name attached to those stamps, therefore, the system is open to money laundering in that respect.  There is no audit trail in place and no reports available on stamps.

That section allows any credit union, at its own discretion, to establish a special fund and such a special fund may be applied to a number of prescribed purposes, including community development.  To give some background information on this, I lived in London in the early 1980s and I joined a credit union the week I moved back to Ireland.  I have been a credit union member ever since, for almost 30 years.  I have been a teller, a volunteer supervisor and stood for election to boards.  Therefore, I am an active credit union member.  I wrote a paper on the matter in 1993.  I was searching at the time for a local investment clause in credit union legislation and I was very happy in 1997 when the Credit Union Act included a local investment clause but it is an enabling clause and not a mandatory clause.  I was very disappointed in the 15 years since then that the clause has not been used.  One credit union, namely Tullamore Credit Union, has created a fund and I was involved in that process in 1999 but, to the best of my knowledge, it has not used it.  I am looking to the committee and the Oireachtas to find a way to encourage credit unions to apply the section 44 process to create special funds.<\/p><p>  The Oireachtas has an instrument available to it in the matter of tax expenditures.  All credit unions gain from tax expenditures, even credit unions that serve relatively small numbers of relatively affluent people.  By virtue of being organised as a credit union, they gain from tax expenditures.   The gain that credit unions get from tax expenditures has not been quantified on either side.  The lack of information on that is regrettable and it  would be better if it were quantified.

Credit unions have been enabled to put funds into a section 44 fund for the past 15 years but they have not done so.  In the eight years after the section 44 provision was enacted, as Mr. Brendan Logue gave evidence to an Oireachtas committee in May 2010, credit unions got very much involved in investing in exotic financial instruments, perpetual bonds, instruments that yielded losses something exceeding 100%.  It is a pity that happened in the eight years after the provision was made for a local investment clause and there was no local investment whatsoever.  That must inform the approach taken in this regard.  Where there are dormant balances I emphasise that they would be better applied to some local development use outside of the credit union itself.<\/p><p>  I have a quote from S&eacute;amus P. MacEoin, whom I consider to be a sort of intellectual pillar around whom the credit union idea took shape in this country from 1951 to 1956.  Before we had any credit unions he was sculpting the idea out of the notions of Alphonse Desjardins and Raiffeisen.  One of S&eacute;amus P. MacEoin's final legacies to the movement was to drive the adoption by the Irish League of Credit Unions of a set of operating principles.  To quote briefly: <blockquote>The credit union vision of social justice extends to both the individual members and to the larger community in which they work and reside.  The credit union ideal is to extend services to all who need and can use it.  Every person is either a member or a potential member and appropriately part of the credit union sphere of interest and concern.  Decisions should be taken with full regard to the interests of the broader community within which the credit union and its members reside.<\/blockquote>That is an operating principle but it is very difficult to travel around this country and look at magnificent credit union premises and have it clear and manifest that the credit union within those doors is operating that particular principle as a priority.  The opportunity is there and that is why I make this submission on the widening of the dormant accounts fund and a greater focus on creating special funds under section 44 at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000024#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Gunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1348143000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gunning.

As far as I understand it from my informal inquiries of credit union board members, who are cautious and discreet people, a mid-sized credit union with about 35 years in business, dating from the 1950s on would expect to have between 2,000 and 10,000 dormant accounts.  A lot is down to the personalities of boards, management and their turnover.  It would vary quite a bit.  Anyone I have asked agrees with me that if it is there it is in the general reserve, as likely as not, and it would be better if it were documented.<\/p><p>  The third question Deputy McGrath asked me is to what purpose funds might be put.  There are two parameters in that regard.  One is the discretion of the credit union and the other is legislation.  Even as it stands, a section 44 fund where established can be used for social, cultural or charitable purposes, including community development.  The establishment of such a fund at present is entirely a matter for decision by a majority of the members.<\/p><p>  To return to the evidence given by Ms Motherway, it is for the members to decide, but Mr. Logue, who is a former regulator, said in his testimony to the committee on regulatory affairs in March 2010 that the democratic system of credit unions has broken down.  It is a dramatic statement but from my observations I tend to agree with him for the reason that we just heard about, namely, that if I have a large amount of money on deposit in a credit union I have a huge incentive to be on the board of the credit union but if I am getting on with my life and I have a loan out for a few grand that I might clear off or get re-financed, I am probably less likely to be highly motivated and focused on being on the board of the credit union.  Based on analysis, one will see from Ms Motherway's evidence that there tends to be a greater than average proportion of people representing the group identified.  That affects decision making, so when it comes to a decision to establish a section 44 fund, one is asking perhaps the more conservative and older cohort of the credit union to make the decision on behalf of the credit union, which is a challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000024#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Gunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1348143000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

That means one could have an interest roll-up for 15 years because it would not require the customer to intervene.  People hold prize bonds for 20 years and 25 years but they are by no means dormant.  Balances on deposit at a credit union or even in an old-style mutual building society for 15 years are far from dormant.<\/p><p>  I suspect that perhaps directors might not have large balances at all.  People go onto boards of directors of various types for different reasons than for protecting the investment they might have.

A material example that occurs to me is that I live in a city area and we do not have any market facilities in the area where I live.  There is no public open market and to have one one would need a hard stand, water risers for market traders to have access to water, and power points.  If the credit unions were on board with a section 44 fund under the community development heading, with local authority backing one could develop designated stand space, hard stand it and, with some cash from a credit union section 44 fund, develop a market stand which would be a commercial outlet for traders and also a civic space and a place of recourse.  That is an example of how a section 44 fund could be turned into something material.  The expenditure side would be immaterial.  It is the other end of the spectrum from the idea of shipping a cartload of money to an international finance fund management firm in Frankfurt or wherever.  Section 44 money is to spend in the locality on items that people can touch, smell or hear.<\/p><p>  The impact of that is to bring more people into a friendly association with the credit union because while I celebrate all the wonderful credit union buildings throughout the country, and I saw them all going up, they are a little intimidating at the same time.  Most credit unions are supportive of organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and that is catching on the tail of things, so to speak, but a fund that is developmental and oriented towards the infrastructure will bring more people into a friendly association with a credit union and help address the sort of generational issue touched upon in an earlier submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000025#AA02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Gunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1348143600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gunning.

The centre held an interesting conference a week or so ago on credit union services organisations and some of the supplementary documentation we have attached is from the speakers who attended the event.  Their conclusion in respect of the idea of mergers is that while they will work in the short to medium term, they do not work in the long term because one merely ends up merging entities, retaining the same model and moving assets around the place.  Consequently, in ten years time or whatever, one will end up with the same kind of issue.  Their view on the idea of credit union services organisations, CUSOs, is that it allows the credit union to keep local the important relational aspects, that is, the interface with the member.  However, one can collaborate on and cluster together some back-office operations to cut down on one's costs or potentially to create another source of income or whatever.  The interesting point about the west Cork model is the four co-operatives concerned, namely, Bandon, Drinagh, Barryroe and Lisavaird, are strong on the ground.  It actually is a very efficient model in that Carbery deals with and concentrates on the global stuff, while the co-operatives such as Bandon and Barryroe focus on the local.  In a way their entire orientation is towards the local, which means they get involved in interesting projects such as onion production or renewable energy.  For example, Barryroe is involved in pig production.  The model allows for this because such co-operatives are looking to the local, while Carbery deals with the global scenario.  Moreover, representatives of the aforementioned co-operatives of course also sit on the Carbery board.  The west Cork co-operatives have been highly successful in respect of milk prices and so on and have beaten many of the other co-operatives.  Their structure facilitates this because they are so member-focused.<\/p><p>  The phrase, \"local presence\", has been thrown around a lot over the past two years or so.  However, what does \"local presence\" mean?  It does not simply mean an office or whatever.  There is a great difference between having an office and having a board at which all the decision-making is made.  A student at the centre is conducting some research at present on a credit union that was merged.  He is finding that while the credit union is able to provide some additional services, the members say it does not outweigh the loss of the relational aspect and so on because when the members now approach the credit union, the decision is made somewhere else, which makes a huge difference.  Another feature of having a board in a credit union is there is someone who is walking down the street and picking up ideas locally.  All that entrepreneurial and innovative stuff is gone and basically while one retains a local, flag-flying presence, in a sense it is an empty shell.  I consider such a local presence to be a key competitive advantage of the credit union and it is only later, when one starts to erode it, that one will perceive what was lost, by which time it is too late as there is no going back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000027#CC01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noreen Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1348144800,"counter":539,"content":"<p>This is even more of a factor at present, with bank branches closing nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000027#CC01300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1348144800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Each of the four submissions has been enormously informative.

In every other jurisdiction in which credit unions operate the term \"supervisory committee\" and its role is clearly defined.  No one has ever sought to change that title or role.

This would simply be a case of the piper calling the tune because there would be no independence of stand back in terms of the operation of the credit union.  In addition, where an internal audit function identified any issues of concern to the credit union these could be swept under the carpet.  We have had evidence of internal audits within our banking structure not being taken seriously.  We welcome the introduction of the internal audit function.  It is good housekeeping in any commercial organisation to have an internal audit function.

If the Chairman will forgive me, I would add a minor clarification.  First, a table, on page 96 of the commission's report, sets out the three bands and it is clear that the table is illustrative.  It was never set in stone that way.  We simply acknowledge that the middle band, from &euro;10 million to &euro;100 million, is a broad band and another one can be put in there.<\/p><p>  If I may expand a little on the idea of the tiered approach by way of clarification, our understanding and interpretation of it is that it is not trying to punish or restrict anybody, particularly smaller credit unions.  What it is trying to do is ensure that there are appropriate levels of regulation.  If one looks at it, the middle tier is very much the current position.  The idea is that the smaller credit unions would have less onerous responsibility and regulation foisted upon them and other credit unions that wanted to grow and develop their services would have additional requirements to meet.<\/p><p>  Another minor point probably worth noting is that there is nothing prohibiting a credit union in a lower level which wants to provide more services for its members from applying for that higher level but it would have to be willing and able to meet the higher levels of regulation.

Our understanding of the draft general scheme is that it does not prohibit a board from nominating one of its directors as treasurer.  Our interpretation of the Bill is that it tries to distinguish between what we would describe as executive functions, that is, management and operations, and non-executive functions in terms of overall governance and strategic direction, which would be the primary role of the member elected board.  It is good to see that the role of manager is being properly recognised and specified, although that in itself comes with a number of challenges for the holders of that role.  We have found from experience that stronger and well run credit unions exhibit a positive relationship between manager and treasurer.  It is essential that every member of the board understands the fundamentals of the business.  The preparation and presentation of accounts are functions for the manager, but there is nothing to prohibit a board from nominating a director to take a lead role in financial matters.  The commission&rsquo;s report recommended that at least one member of the board should have financial experience.  We have seen examples of finance committees working very well in a number of credit unions.  We certainly welcome the proposed role for managers.  These provisions simply formalise what already obtains in many credit unions, as well as placing a responsibility on managers to perform.<\/p><p>  Credit unions can participate in credit union service organisations, CUSOs.  The Credit Union Development Association is a CUSO because we are owned by a number of credit unions and have been established for a specific purpose.  We exist to deliver value to our credit unions and, in fairness to them, they challenge us to deliver value at least once per year.  There is nothing to stop a credit union from participating in a CUSO, but its nature depends on where it is regulated.  CUSOs are regulated by different parts of the Central Bank according to their nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000032#HH01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1348148100,"counter":614,"content":"<p>As there are no further questions for Mr. Johnson, we will proceed to the Credit Union Managers Association.

The Credit Union Managers Association is the representative association for professional credit union managers in Ireland.  Our membership comprises approximately 260 credit union managers.  The function of the credit union manager is to work at the coalface with credit union members on a consistent daily basis and to liaise with our voluntary boards.  As Mr. Kevin Johnson has already indicated there is a very strong and healthy relationship at the moment between credit union managers and credit union boards of directors which we would like to see continue.<\/p><p>  The Credit Union Managers Association felt there was an absolute need for new legislation on credit unions.  We are acutely aware of the difficulties credit unions are experiencing in the current economic environment.  Much of the discussion in the past two days has centred on what I would consider to be minute matters considering the major difficulties for all financial institutions and, in particular, credit unions.  Mr. Kevin Johnson alluded to the forthcoming personal insolvency legislation and its potential impact on credit unions.<\/p><p>  Credit unions have sustained themselves throughout the economic storm the country has faced in recent years.  It is a credit to the volunteers and the credit union members and staff that we have managed to do that.  However, we are by no means perfect.  It is commendable that credit unions are still lending and have not sustained the levels of losses of other financial institutions.  However, it would be remiss to say we are perfect - we are not perfect and have our faults.<\/p><p>  In September 2010 the Registrar of Credit Unions said that without proper systems of accountability, risk management and control, credit unions would continue to struggle to meet the demands of an increasingly sophisticated member base in which they operate.  In most cases, problems arising in credit unions can be traced back to poor governance.  Historically where there are problems in credit unions in many cases those problems have been caused by poor governance.  We are delighted the draft Bill reflects the commission report's recommendations on proper governance.  As a credit union manager representing credit union managers, I can say that we believe all aspects of the draft Bill reflect the changed economic environment and increased levels of regulation, and that it is balanced and proportionate.<\/p><p>  I have some concerns over some of the comments about the proposed tier structure for credit unions.  Members should recognise that the tier 2 structure for the &euro;10 million to &euro;100 million-credit unions will not change how we are regulated at present.  It is important to clarify that point because people might be under the impression that if the Bill is introduced all sorts of weird and wonderful things will happen in regard to regulation.  We are being regulated and will continue to be regulated in regard to tier 2 credit unions.  As Mr. Johnson has said, tier 1 credit unions with low risk levels might be regulated less severely which is positive.  Obviously it is important from a prudential perspective that credit unions with an asset base in excess of &euro;100 million should have stronger regulation.  Credit union managers have no difficulty with that.<\/p><p>  The other aspects of the Bill have really not been discussed in the past two days.  They deal with matters such as the central rulebook.  We welcome this because it provides clarity to us when we are doing our jobs.  In order to find out what is wrong with the HSE it is necessary to ask the nurses and doctors, who are doing the job of dealing with patients on a daily basis.  We are dealing with members who are under severe financial difficulty and we are acutely aware of these difficulties.<\/p><p>  We welcome the fitness and probity regime.  We believe it is appropriate for credit union volunteers, managers and staff to have the appropriate skills, capacity and competency to look after members' money.  Protection of members' money is the most important thing.<\/p><p>  I will deal with the role of the manager.  We welcome that the function of credit union managers is being recognised as separate from that of the board.  I wish to clarify any ambiguity as to why these changes are being promoted.  The commission's report recognises that the manager and staff are responsible for the operation of the credit union on a daily basis.  The board is responsible for the governance and future strategy of the credit union.  It is important to have clarity on those two distinct roles and we welcome those changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000033#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Gilleece"},{"type":"speech","time":1348148100,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gilleece for her submission and presentation.

Would Ms Gilleece see a benefit in widening the tiered approach to have another tier between the &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million?<\/p><p>  I believe Ms Gilleece is in a unique position to comment on a matter dealt with earlier - the requirement for the auditor to step down after six years.

The Deputy asked if we thought there should be an additional layer or tier included in the current proposed three-tier structure.  I have listened intently to some of the arguments on the proposed tiered system.  Yesterday there was considerable debate on promoting the UK two-version model.<\/p> <p>It was certainly indicated this would be a preferable approach with regard to credit unions in Ireland.  I want to ensure Deputies are very clear on the alternative proposal.  Credit unions in the UK have 1% market penetration and &pound;1.6 billion in assets as opposed to more than &euro;13 billion in Ireland.  The credit union is a relatively new phenomenon in the UK whereas the credit union movement has been in Ireland for 50 years.  Version 1 credit unions in the UK are required to have a reserve level of only 3% and version 2 credit unions are required to have an 8% level, whereas in Ireland credit unions are required to have a minimum reserve base of 10%.  It is inappropriate to tinker with what is being proposed.  As was stated yesterday, credit unions in the UK want to emulate what is happening in Ireland.<\/p><p> As I outlined, tier 2 credit unions will continue to be regulated as they are at present and this is a very important point.  Tier 1 credit unions, which are those with less than &euro;10 million, will have slightly softer regulation because of the reduced risk.  I use the word \"softer\" although it is probably not appropriate.  Tier 3 credit unions, which have a wider range of investments, risks and activities, will require stronger regulation.  This is appropriate because it is about saving and protecting our members' money and we do not have any difficulty with this.<\/p><p> With regard to the terms of office for the auditor, credit union managers work with auditors more closely than anyone else in the credit union, with annual and interim audits being conducted.  We have good and strong relationships with our auditors.  The commission has stated it is appropriate for a credit union to seek to replace its auditor at the end of a six year term and this new auditor should not be from the same practice.  We believe this is good governance.  It reduces the risk of over-familiarity and, as Deputy Mathews stated this morning, it allows the accounts to be seen by a fresh pair of eyes.  The suggestion of passing on information from one auditing company to another when an order is being replaced is very good and is best practice.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the development of a protocol with MABS.  Credit unions recognise it is important to have such a protocol, but we have difficulties with the fact that at present credit unions working with members in arrears are categorised by MABS as less important than other creditors.  Credit unions were responsible for founding MABS 20 years ago and many of us have been involved in the management committee of MABS during the past 20 years.  It creates a difficulty for us when MABS approaches us that credit unions are towards the end of the list for repayments.  We have seen instances where catalogue companies have had priority over us.  We need to work with MABS on a protocol.  Other financial institutions have signed up to a protocol with MABS.  We see the impact of the mortgage arrears resolution process on credit unions.  We have always worked with MABS and wish to continue to do so, but we need to be very careful because personal insolvency legislation is being introduced and we do not know what its impact will be on credit unions.  We do not even know what shape it will take or how it will apply to our members.  If we want to protect our members' money we must be very careful in our relationship with MABS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000033#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Gilleece","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348148700,"counter":619,"content":"<p>What about Dundrum Credit Union's flexi-loan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000034#KK00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348148700,"counter":620,"content":"<p>We welcome new initiatives.

It should be taken into consideration.  Deputy Heather Humphreys referred to it in her question on replacing directors.  Although it might seem that a small nucleus of people are incessantly involved, they are the core.  It is the same with clubs in rural areas.  If the core people are removed, there may not be many replacements.  The same applies in the case of auditors, in that a rural area might have only one or two people with the necessary skillset to look after credit unions.  Has this matter been taken into account?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000035#LL00800","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speech","time":1348149300,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

The legislation on personal insolvency provides for debt relief certificates for people who are in severe financial difficulty.  This will impact on credit unions.  The legislation also provides for other facilities including agreements between debtors and creditors.  I appreciate what the Chairman has said and as such will not go into detail now on the issue of debt arrangements.  However, these will also impact on credit unions.  We are currently trying to quantify that impact and are looking at innovative ways of preparing for it, in terms of setting aside reserves specifically to deal with the impact of personal insolvency when it hits.  It was in that context I was referring to personal insolvency.<\/p><p>  I will try to clarify the reason it appears we are poles apart from other organisations in regard to governance.  The clarity of roles is a hugely important issue for the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA.  As I have already explained, the function of a credit union manager is to operate the credit union.  The word \"operate\" is defined in the commission report.  Our function on a day-to-day basis is dealing with members and staff and carrying out the policies of the board.  The function of the board is governance.  The treasurer of the credit union is defined under the Credit Union Act 1997 as managing director of the credit union.  It is the treasurer's responsibility under that Act to ensure preparation of the credit union's accounts and so on and their presentation to the board.  It is also the function of the treasurer to present those accounts to the members at an annual general meeting.  <\/p><p>  The impression was given earlier that the treasurer is elected by the members and is, therefore, as treasurer accountable to them.  The treasurer is not elected by members - he or she is elected by the board of directors from within the board following an annual general meeting.  It is important to clarify that matter.  The treasurer is accountable to members through the board.  Under this Bill, the manager is given specific functions, including the preparation of the accounts.  In reality, the manager of a credit union prepares the accounts.  That is what we are paid to do.  The Bill is, therefore, reflecting the actual reality in credit unions.  The Bill requires that the manager will present those accounts to the board of directors and that the board, or someone designated by it, can present the accounts to members.  This is appropriate as it ensures a manager, who has a contract of employment with the board, who does not do his or her job or is not, for some reason, performing can be fired.  The position of the treasurer is not so clearly defined because the members appoint the board.  As such, members, if they wish to, would have to remove a member of the board.  It is appropriate, if it is the case that the manager prepares the accounts for submission to the board on a monthly basis and has various other responsibilities in the credit union, that this, as opposed to something that is not happening, is what is defined.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000036#MM00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Gilleece"},{"type":"speech","time":1348149900,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Perhaps Ms Gilleece would quickly dispose of her response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions and move on to Deputy Humphreys' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000036#MM00900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348149900,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett also asked if credit unions are experiencing problems as a result of poor governance.

This is repeated in previous statements by the Central Bank.  It is an issue in credit unions.  I cannot go into detail on the matter now.  However, if the Deputy requires more information it might be worth his while asking the Central Bank the reasons it believes poor governance has caused problems in credit unions.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Humphrey's question - this also addresses Deputy Boyd Barrett's concerns around terms of office - it is unfortunate that we appear to be poles apart from other organisations.  However, we believe it is appropriate for a board member to step down after nine years, which is a long time, but to continue if he or she so wishes as a member of the audit, credit, credit control or other committee.  There are many committees within the credit unions and a huge amount of work to be done.  We are suggesting not that a board member step down after nine years and leave the credit union but that he or she step down after that period, upskill and become involved in other areas within the credit union and, if he or she so chooses, to take up a position on the board again after six years.  I do not understand why this proposal is at issue.  The person will continue to volunteer and give his or her service.  We are not in any way seeking to undermine the work of the volunteer.  We are simply seeking to reorganise, to improve and upskill and ensure that the board and nominations committee canvass within their common bond to get new people involved in credit unions.  It may not be popular to say this but many of the people currently on credit union boards have been there for 35 or 40 years.  The proposal being put forward seeks to change this and to bring in new people and skills.  We do not have any difficulty with that and cannot understand the reason anyone else would have a difficulty with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000036#MM01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Gilleece"},{"type":"speech","time":1348149900,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Mr. Johnson wishes to add a postscript.

The person may have no need for the money but it is in the account for a specific purpose that in the event of the person's death, the money saved will be automatically doubled, and the person may want to leave the money to children, a spouse, etc.  If we start fiddling with that and requiring credit unions to take out money that is considered dormant, that insurance is gone.  There are many credit union members who save because the additional insurance exists at no cost to them.

Deputy Humphreys mentioned electronic funds transfer, EFT.  There are currently 68 credit unions providing either EFT or automated teller machine facilities.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned governance.  We are interpreting and accepting the legislation as trying to attain a balance between the evident passion that exists for delivering value to members and their communities with ensuring the competence exists to steward the business.  In other words, the business is the only source of income and capital.  It is the only way to fund the delivery of benefits to individual members, families and communities.  That is why it is so important to attain that balance.  Although the processes are there, some of them have never been set out, so we welcome the great clarity this legislation will bring.  As we indicated earlier, people will operate much better in an environment of certainty.<\/p><p>  With regard to personal insolvency, the key message we try to emphasise is that the credit union model is very simple.  Members put money into a union and other members borrow it.  There is no third party of access to capital anywhere else.  When a person gets a loan, the commitment is to the fellow members and the duty of the credit union is to get it back for those members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000037#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150500,"counter":655,"content":"<p>It is not for bondholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000037#NN00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348150500,"counter":656,"content":"<p>There is no one to be burned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000037#NN00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150500,"counter":657,"content":"<p>A social bond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000037#NN00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348150500,"counter":658,"content":"<p>That is why it is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092000037#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150500,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I am anxious to move to Mr. &Oacute; Cearbhaill, who has been sitting patiently for quite a while.

I welcome this opportunity to appear before them to discuss the Department's Statement of Strategy 2011-2014.  I am joined by colleagues from the Department - Dr. Fergal Lynch, deputy secretary general, Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary and Mr Tony O'Brien, director general designate of the HSE and also a member of the MAC at the Department.<\/p><p>  The statement of strategy 2011-14 sets out the high level aims and objectives of the health system for that period.  It also states the Department's functions and responsibilities in leading health service reform and identifies our strategic goals and programmes for improving health outcomes.  This three-year period will be a time of very significant change for the health services. The programme for Government commits to the development of a universal single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, providing access to health services based on need rather than income.  We must ensure that patients access care in an appropriate setting, which will require the improvement and development of community-based services through the primary care system.  New models of care will be introduced across all services which will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the lowest cost.  These ongoing initiatives will inform the most appropriate structure, staffing and organisation of services and also deliver greater productivity.  Increasing efficiency and productivity will require changes in how, where and when people work.  It will require greater flexibility in work practices and rosters to maximise the efficient delivery of services. This scale of reform combined with our financial and economic circumstances will present many and difficult challenges for the health services in the years ahead.  <\/p><p>  The statement of strategy sets out the process by which the Department will deliver on its role and strategic goals within this context.  Total current expenditure for the public health service is being reduced by nearly &euro;1.1 billion over the period 2011-2014 under the national recovery plan.  However, in order to meet unavoidable pressures and Government commitments, in excess of &euro;2 billion will have to be taken out of the health budget over the same period.  The number of health service staff has been reduced from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to fewer than 102,000 now, with a further 6,500 to depart by 2014.  While this scale of financial and staff reductions has put pressure on the health system, the system has responded by delivering more with less.<\/p><p>  With regard to delivery on the programme for Government, significant progress is being made on the implementation of the health integrated reform plan.  Legislation is being progressed in regard to HSE governance, extending free GP care, risk equalisation and reference pricing.  Reports have been published in regard to the disability value for money and policy review and the review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The special delivery unit continues its support to hospitals to maintain the downward trend in regard to numbers waiting in emergency departments.  Implementation plans have been agreed for a number of clinical care programmes which will improve the quality of patient care, improve access and save money.  Work is ongoing on the completion of the framework for smaller hospitals and on the development of hospital groups. The national carers' strategy has recently been published, the national positive ageing strategy is nearing completion and the national strategy on dementia will be developed by 2013.  The reform of mental health services continues to progress in line with A Vision for Change and 13 of the old psychiatric hospitals have closed completely or have closed to new admissions.  The policy framework for the future of public health 2012-20, Your Health is Your Wealth, is nearing completion.  The report of the national substance misuse strategy was launched in February 2012 and an action plan to implement its recommendations is being developed.  The special action group on obesity is progressing cross-sectoral measures to help halt the rise in obesity.  Discussions are ongoing with a view to achieving further reductions in pharmaceutical costs and the use of generic alternatives.  The health sector action plan continues to be implemented across the health sector.  Key commitments include reviewing rosters, skill mix and staffing levels, increased use of redeployment and changing work practices.  <\/p><p>  These and related follow-on initiatives will form the Department's work programme for the coming years. <\/p> <p>The Department's statement of strategy sets out what we want to achieve over this timeframe, how we intend to make it happen and how we will know, and to what extent, we have succeeded.  We have organised our goals and actions by strategic programme areas.  Programme 1 relates to fair access and sustainability.  Programme 2 relates to patient safety and quality.  Programme 3 relates to health and well-being.  Programme 4 relates to primary care.  Programme 5 relates to acute hospitals and programme 6 relates to specialised care services.  However, it should be emphasised that four elements underpin and inform all of the strategic programmes: keeping people healthy; providing the health care people need; delivering high quality services; and getting the best value from the health system resources.  The overall performance framework for the health system and the performance indicators developed under the framework will be used to assess the health system's progress in regard to its core objectives and will be reported on annually.  That concludes my statement.  Together with my colleagues I look forward to our discussion on the statement of strategy and related issues.  We will take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348130400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank members of staff of the HSE and the Department of Health who do tremendous work every day in delivering a health system for patients.

The health system is going through a transformative stage in terms of governance of the HSE; in effect, it is bringing it back closer to the Department.  The HSE will be challenged with significant difficulties this year in terms of a further budget reduction of &euro;700 million to &euro;750 million, which will have an impact on the capacity of the HSE to deliver health services.<\/p><p>  It is important that we get clarity on the issue.  I accept legislation is in place on governance structures and the current lines of demarcation.  The HSE is facing a budget.  Last year's budget has not lived up to the profiling of expenditure and the outturn to date.  As far back as last March it was evident that the budget was not sustainable.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last June Mr. O'Brien's predecessor was adamant that the premise on which the budget was based was no longer feasible in terms of revenue-generating measures such as insurance, cost reductions, price referencing, generic substitution and agency staff.  Budget difficulties in terms of sustainability were evident from an early stage.  At the same time claims have been made that a profiling system is in place which allows the HSE to monitor its expenditure on a monthly basis and to know which hospital budgets have overrun and when difficulties arise, whereas previously such information was only available on a quarterly basis.  One could ask why it took until September to make any effort to address the overrun.  It is said that, traditionally, it was the case that when the HSE overran its budget supplementary support was always available at the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000004#C00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1348130400,"counter":748,"content":"<p>We are discussing the health strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000004#C00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1348130400,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Strategies are not much good without budgets.  I am not being flippant but this is important in terms of the governance structures being put forward.  Who will be responsible for formulating the budget for 2013 and who will be the accounting officer with responsibility for oversight of the spending of the budget?  I do not understand the situation.  Will it be Mr. Tony O'Brien or Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin as the accounting officer for the Department of Health?  The lines of demarcation are blurred.  We had cases in recent weeks where claims were made that the HSE introduced the proposed cuts of &euro;130 million.  We were told subsequently by the HSE that it was a Government decision.  It is critically important that in the coming months we learn who is responsible for expenditure and oversight of the budget and who is ultimately the accounting officer.  There is not much point in my going into the D&aacute;il blaming the Minister for Health if it is not his fault, if a decision has been made by the HSE and if its board is still making decisions.  We must have such information.<\/p><p>  I do not expect a comment on the broader issue of primary care but it is a critical part of the overall strategy to remove patients from acute hospitals and to work through the primary care setting to ensure patients are treated as close to home as possible.  Where does Dr. McLoughlin envisage funding will come from for physical infrastructure in the future in terms of the capital infrastructural development required for primary care settings throughout the country?  Does he expect public private partnerships to be involved in some way or will the development be funded through a capital programme from the State's coffers?  Those two issues are important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000004#C00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1348130400,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I also welcome Dr. McLoughlin.  This is his first opportunity to address the committee.  I also join in wishing Mr. Tony O'Brien the very best in his new role and responsibilities.<\/p><p>  Reference was made in the strategy and again in Dr. McLoughlin's address to total expenditure for the public health service being reduced by approximately &euro;1.1 billion over the period 2011 to 2014.  It is then stated that to meet what are described as unavoidable pressures and Government commitments in excess of &euro;2 billion will have to be taken out of the health budget over the same period.  Could Dr. McLoughlin explain the difference between the two figures?  I cannot get clear in my head exactly what has been said.  Could he tell us what is the projected cut year-on-year for 2013 and 2014?  Does he have those figures?  It is clear that cuts must take place in the context of a &euro;2 billion reduction in budget.<\/p><p>  The strategy is guided by the Government's promised health care reforms and a cornerstone of the reform was the roll-out of free GP care for all.  Initially it was to apply to patients with long-term illness.  We were told recently that draft legislation in that regard has run into difficulties because of complex legal matters and could be delayed by as much as a year.  What is the position in that regard now and how soon will the initial steps be taken on the roll-out of free GP care for all?<\/p><p>  A &euro;10 million cut has been indicated for personal assistant services.

Could we have certainty that the cut has been confined to the dustbin?<\/p><p>  What of the &euro;35 million ring-fenced for community mental health services?  Again, Dr. McLoughlin made direct reference to the importance of the service, with which I fully agree.  Could he give us an indication as to whether the Minister of State has been pick-pocketed of the so-called ring-fenced &euro;35 million?<\/p><p>  On the reducing cost of medicines - Dr. McLoughlin has some experience in the sector - the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill is going through the Oireachtas at present and we have been told progress has been made in talks with the pharmacy sector.  However, there is growing evidence that there is not only a significant differential between the cost of branded products in the North compared to the South and between this jurisdiction and other EU member states but also between the generic alternatives.  There are incredible indicators that there is as much profiteering with generic substitutes as could be the case with the branded products.  What steps have been taken to ensure that real savings are made as a result of the passage of the legislation, which I support?<\/p><p>  I could not let the moment pass without referring to the petty and cruel cut to support for people with coeliac disease.  I have acknowledged previously that I am a parent of children with coeliac disease.  We are not beneficiaries under a medical card scheme but many of those I know who are find it very difficult because the gluten-free food alternatives for people with coeliac disease are hugely expensive.<\/p> <p>That is very problematic for those already on limited budgets because to qualify for a medical card, means tested as it is, they must be in fairly straitened economic circumstances.

I wish them well in their roles in the future.<\/p><p>  I find it difficult to take this document seriously.  It is completely at odds with what we see on the ground in our hospitals, home care services, community care services and mental health services.  Page 2 of the document refers to the Department's values, service and the need to operate to the highest standards of professionalism.  I do not believe the health services on the ground are being operated by the Health Service Executive, at management level or by the Department, to professional standards.  I do not believe, for instance, that the wholesale closure of beds in wards throughout the hospital system meets professional standards.  I do not believe that the overcrowding in our accident and emergency departments or the lack of respect for patients on trolleys in corridors in those departments means that.<\/p><p>  On the point of fairness and respect, one would imagine that would mean respect for patients.  In very many cases our patients are being backed up in accident and emergency departments on trolleys and in wards.  On the other hand, there are major delays for various services and waiting lists.  A lady contacted me yesterday whose child is an urgent case for ear, nose and throat treatment.  That child will have to wait 18 months for the first out patient appointment.<\/p><p>  On the reference to openness and consultation, I hope that means there will be openness and consultation in the future to ensure that the views of stakeholders, and in particular the perspectives of patients and other service users, are at the heart of the decision making process.  That is not my experience of openness and consultation, either by the Department or the Health Service Executive.  My experience of it is that the Health Service Executive and the Department make their decision and go through a consultation process that is a farce.  I hope it will change in the future.<\/p><p>  This document is at variance with what we see on the ground and also with the recent cutbacks announced, I am not sure by whom.  I agree with Deputy Kelleher on that.  We are not sure who is running the health services now, whether it is the HSE, the Secretary General or the Minister.  Page 18 of the report regarding disability services refers to helping people with disabilities achieve their full potential, including living as independently as possible.  Obviously, it believes the way to do that is to cut &euro;10 million from the personal assistant budget.  How anyone could come up with that proposal is beyond me and is at variance with that point.<\/p><p>  The same page refers to services to enhance the quality of life of older people, maintain their full potential and support them in their homes and communities.  Six hundred thousand home help hours were cut in the budget earlier this year.  That is at variance with the document in terms of what is happening on the ground.  I find it difficult to take it seriously.<\/p><p>  The document refers to the cutting of funding by more than &euro;2 billion between 2011 and 2014.  That is not achievable if we want a reasonable and effective health service for patients.  The officials must know that.  Have they not thought of alternative methods of funding a proper health service?  Why not ensure that very wealthy people pay their fair share of taxation and that taxation is put to work to fund a proper health service and not the difficult service patients find themselves tied up in now?  It is the duty and responsibility of senior management in both the HSE and the Department to examine alternative methods of funding, particularly funding from very wealthy individuals who are not paying their fair share of taxation.

At the end of last year the Government published its comprehensive expenditure review from 2012 to 2014.  That report indicated that further savings of &euro;1.1 billion in current health expenditure would be required over the period.  I want to make it clear that this is in the context of the national recovery plan, which is being signed off by Government, and there are conditions attaching to that recovery plan.<\/p><p>  I want to explain the &euro;700 million to &euro;900 million gap.  Overall expenditure limits for 2012 to 2014 were set in the context of the CER process.

They have to be funded by way of savings.  These unavoidable pressures include demographic pressures, an increasing birth rate, an aging population, increased incidence of disabilities, demand-led schemes such as medical cards and drugs schemes, pay costs, superannuation and increments, acute hospital deficits carried forward from 2012, and full year cost of developments commenced in 2012.<\/p><p>  The other measures required to improve efficiency in the system include improving financial systems, the development of shared services, better procurement and more efficient prescribing.  These will require a degree of up-front investment in terms of cash and staffing and will also have to be funded from services.<\/p> <p>Measures to improve or develop services, including commitments in the programme for Government, are not provided for within the expenditure limits and can only proceed if a commensurate saving is achievable in another area of the health service.  Programme for Government commitments include: measures to improve access to hospital services and emergency department and elective waiting times; the development of transition care programmes; the extension of free GP care; investment in primary care, mental health and services for older people; and addressing the cost of the health care reform programme in general - for example, moving towards universal health insurance.<\/p><p> One should bear in mind that there are some very significant issues for the health system to address and that progress can only be made if we increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health service.  In this regard, I would like to put on record some very important developments.  The strategies that the Department and HSE are applying are working in a significant way.  For example, there has been a 20.6% year-on-year reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys, or over 13,000 fewer people, and a reduction from an all-time high of 569 patients on trolleys on 5 January 2011 to 139 on 7 September 2012, representing a 75% reduction.  We want to see a continuation of the reduction.  Overall surgical waiting lists have decreased in the past year by 7% while every time band has seen a substantial reduction, with the figure for those waiting over 12 months reducing by 85%, that for those waiting for nine months reducing by 63% and that for those waiting over three months reducing by 18%.  Therefore, significant progress is being made.<\/p><p> I want to challenge some of the points made by some of the Deputies with a view to offering clarification on the issues and enhancing their understanding.  It is not true that we are not delivering on the cost of medicines.  We have very intensive discussions under way.  These were always going to be complex and difficult.  I worked in the pharmaceutical sector for a decade or more and can assure the members that there is no easy solution.  The negotiations will be difficult and drawn out, and they will cover the coming three years, but I am very confident they will bring in the revenue suggested in various Government papers.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that we will achieve the &euro;125 million target pertaining to insurance.  We are working in partnership with the HSE to deliver in this regard.  Work has been ongoing with the HSE for many months, namely, from the beginning of the year, to achieve the best outcome.  With regard to insurance and income collection, this matter is simply about the health system claiming what it is entitled to from the insurance system.  Wisely, the Department and its Minister decided to enter into negotiations with the insurance companies.  My colleague, Mr. Fergal Lynch, will explain in further detail that we have an active task force engaged in recovering the funds.<\/p><p> With regard to the cost of medicines, we are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the clinicians to ensure we achieve the most cost-effective solution.  We are anxious to ensure that new medicines, when they become available and are clinically approved, will be available to the patients of Ireland.  We are making progress on these issues.<\/p><p> In my Department, absenteeism has reduced from over 4% to 2.8%.  In one instance, over the August bank holiday weekend, I discovered an absenteeism rate of 11%.  Such levels are not sustainable.  With the HSE and my colleague Mr. Tony O'Brien, we have published the details in accordance with the wishes of the Minister.  This is so the public can see for itself what hospitals and services are performing to a very high level of cost-effectiveness.  The way to see the health system through the next three years is to be cost-effective and really deliver value for patients, both public and private.<\/p><p> With regard to governance, the legal position is very clear.  Mr. Tony O'Brien is the accounting officer for the HSE.  He is ultimately answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have an oversight role as Secretary General of the Department of Health and work with my colleague in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Let me make a number of points on service planning.  Service planning is not a perfect science.  I have been in the health system for many decades and can assure members that there will always be a challenge at service planning time.  What we must do is learn.  Two independent experts have examined the matter and we now need to improve our financial management and control systems to ensure we obtain value for money.<\/p><p> I assure the members that the Minister and Ministers of State, Deputies Reilly, Shortall and Lynch, respectively, are fully supportive of the initiatives the Department and HSE are working through on their behalf, thus ensuring that we have the most efficient, effective and cost-effective health system possible.  It is a matter of ensuring that we have appropriate, relevant and timely information so we can know precisely the position on the health system at a given time.<\/p><p> I want to clarify the matter of reference pricing legislation.  I assure the committee that there are clear working plans in place.  We are working with industry, the Irish Medicines Board and other parties to ensure that when the Houses pass the reference pricing legislation, we will be in a position to achieve a very significant reduction, not only in the cost of medicines to the State but also, I hope, in the cost of medicines for private patients by way of a spin-off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000005#D01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348131600,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Does Dr. McLoughlin accept that members and the wider public are frustrated over reducing the cost base?

Experts such as Professor Michael Barry and others believe we need to ensure we have the most cost-effective options available to both public and private patients.  This is very difficult.  I am very appreciative of the fact that the pharmaceutical industry is worth &euro;40 billion to the State.  There are 25,000 people employed directly in the sector and over 100,000 people employed indirectly.  Therefore, we must work through the issues in a sensitive way.  It is very important to have a good relationship with those in the industry.  Ireland has 33 oncologists, 25 of whom have been trained in the top centres in the world.  We must protect the clinical research and clinical trial programmes.

I do not have the precise timeframe but expect that the document will be published in due course when the decisions have been made at a political level.  Professor John Higgins is working around the country.  There has been fairly intensive consultation.  Even after the publication of the reports, I am sure there will be continuing dialogue with a view to shaping the very best hospital system possible for the people.<\/p><p>  I do not want to get into the issues associated with coeliac disease.  I am very sensitive to the fact that there are those who may feel aggrieved at the decision that was made.  Gluten-free produce is available in normal supermarket chains now.  Gluten-free flour, for example, is a lot less costly than it used to be and is available in the large supermarket chains for between &euro;2 and &euro;3.  One can buy products that were not available heretofore.  Through the health system, such products would cost &euro;9 or &euro;10.  I saw a price of &euro;8.93 charged by a community pharmacy.  We are in very difficult economic circumstances and no item of expenditure can be excluded.  I do not want to be seen to be avoiding any area.  In fact, the value-for-money report on disability identifies a number of areas that will have to be examined carefully to determine whether value for money can be obtained.  Unfortunately, we are where we are and must live with the reality of the challenging economic environment.<\/p> <p>Moreover, as a Department we must work with the HSE in a collaborative and cohesive manner.

The strategy is very important because one must know where one is at a particular time.  One must have an idea about where one will be in three years' time and how one is going to get there.  Consequently, the three questions are: where is one now, where does one want to go and how is one going to get there?  This strategy maps out that process in a systematic way and I am hugely confident we can deliver on this and deliver the programme for Government for the Ministers.  In that context, I am happy to inform members there is a strategic framework document, which is to be considered by the Ministers and subsequently will be managed through the Cabinet and the Government.  There will be a publication in due course and I expect this will be done in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348132200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Work is under way on the completion of the framework for smaller hospitals and the development of hospital groups.

However, it is gratifying to see it and I hope it can continue.  If I may, I will make one or two suggestions that might point towards further savings.  More use might be got out of equipment that is handed out through hospitals.  For example, when a patient leaves hospital using crutches, the HSE or the hospitals do not appear to be interested in getting them back.  I believe there could be considerable savings if such issues were addressed.  I have heard of a similar case in respect of special mattresses, which I understand cost approximately &euro;7,000 each, and which then were discarded.  Moreover, there are probably other examples of which I am not personally aware.

I understand completely the strategy and appreciate it will be a political decision as to when it is reported upon.  All members probably could guess, within particular groupings or areas, the likelihood of what the suggestions will be and they will collaborate with the public.  However, given the political and parochial opposition that already is mounting in campaigns nationwide, how do the witnesses plan to manage the roll-out of the much-needed changes?  It is a given, based on the national recovery plan and the diminishing budgets available to us, that while services obviously must be delivered in a patient-focused and safe manner, this must be on a regional, as opposed to a parochial basis, to which we have tended to hang on in recent years.

I note we have a structured approach to this consultation process.  For example, independently of my Department, Professor Higgins is engaged in that dialogue at present.  Moreover, there will be further dialogue.  Deputy Doherty is correct, in that we must deliver the contents of these two documents in a way that ensures people understand it is about patients.  It is about giving patients the best option, that is, the safest care possible.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point that I would like to get across, which is that these smaller hospitals have a hugely important role to play in the future of our health system, and this will be clear when the documents are published.  There is a range of services that currently are not provided in the small hospitals, which create pressures on larger hospitals to provide.  Consequently, there is an opportunity for a market niche for small hospitals which, in my opinion, will bring about a pathway to an orderly, structured hospital system at local, regional, super-regional and national level.  This is of critical importance.<\/p><p>  As for the matters raised about the political and the parochial, while I am probably out of line on this, there will be a need for very strong political leadership across parties in this regard.

There is a shortage of theatre staff.  What measures are being taken to address it?  I find it difficult to rely on the demand and service supply statistics being quoted.  My experience on the ground would differ from those quoted.  Has there been an administrative change in definitions for waiting lists, service activities and throughput activity?  It seems there is an unchallenged ministerial and departmental view that primary care will cost considerably less than hospital-based services.  I contend this is not necessarily so and I would like to hear the views of the witness.<\/p><p>  What is the role of the so-called smaller hospitals?  If one looks at a map of Ireland, public services in the west and north west are markedly less than in other areas of the country.  Will the concept of the golden hour continue to apply in relation to Sligo regional hospital and Letterkenny hospital?  What happens to the strategy if and when the financial projections fail to materialise?  Why do we still have patients travelling from the west and the north west to attend specialist consultants in Dublin when there is an IT infrastructure, where a consultant could talk to a consultant with the patient and look at the scans.  Why are we not exploiting the existing technology and saving the patients from travelling from the far ends of the country to Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000008#G00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1348132800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and wish them well in their new roles.  We have heard a great deal about the drive for efficiencies in the Department and in the hospital networks.  In the past if those in the public sector did not spend their allocation they did not get it again.  How will efficiency be rewarded within hospital networks?  I also worked in the HSE and I remember coming up to November or December making decisions to buy a flat screen television for the out patient waiting room because if we did not spend the money it would be taken from the budget for the following year.  Some hospitals have been implementing the efficiencies and are doing what they have been asked.  Will they be punished next time around or how will their efficiency be rewarded?

My grandfather, who is lucky enough to have private health insurance, spent a long period of time in a public hospital and then had a very serious operation in a private hospital.  On the day he was discharged from the private hospital, he was presented with a bill.  He is still waiting for his bill from the public hospital.  That is just not good enough.  He has paid for health insurance all his life and he knows the insurance money is there and he wants the money to be returned to the State.  Somebody is not doing their job.

This was one of the issues highlighted by the Ogden review of financial management systems in the HSE, commissioned by the Secretary General in June.  It identified a wide range of areas for improvement in the systems, processes and structures around the financial management system.  One issue it picked up on was the fact there is no reward for a manager to remain within budget and no incentive to achieve savings.  Neither are there penalties for people who overspend.  The Deputy is correct that there may have been a culture of no incentive to make savings.  On foot of the Ogden report, measures will be put in place to address its recommendations.<\/p><p>  The Ogden report identified a need to improve the capacity and capability of the financial system in the HSE.  For example, the proportion of qualified accountants working in finance in the HSE is only 10% whereas in the UK the norm is 25%.  The Secretary General earlier referred to the need to invest to improve efficiency in the system.  The Ogden report identifies a need for investing not just in improved ICT financial systems but also in human resources and capacity, along with better procedures to ensure better oversight and control of expenditure.  There is a need for us to focus on the financial management systems in the HSE.  To do that, we will have to achieve savings elsewhere in the system.  The Ogden report, we hope, will be published shortly.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy asked whether there is a limit below which the health service cannot be funded.  The extent to which we can deliver on the health reform programme and on providing an efficient, effective and high quality service is dependent on the degree to which we can extract efficiencies and costs savings from the existing system, as well as addressing existing inefficiencies and improve the processes, procedures and the models of delivery of care.  In a great many areas, a different model of providing care would provide a more efficient service as well as improving quality of care for patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092000009#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348133400,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I am a little concerned members might think the strategy is irrelevant.

The development of chronic disease management programmes is in train, particularly for the management of diabetes, which is at an advanced stage.

I subsequently worked in London for the National Board for Prices and Incomes and the Pay Board, both instruments of government policy, and for a period in the Department of Business Studies at Queens University, Belfast.  In 1974 I took up a position as a socio-economist in the Department of Labour in Dublin, working closely as an adviser to the then Minster, Mr. Michael O'Leary, from whom I learned a great deal about commitment and integrity in public life.  In 1977 I was appointed deputy chairman of the Labour Court and I became chairman in 1984.  In 1989 I went to work for the aircraft leasing company GPA in Shannon as part of a team tasked by Dr. Tony Ryan with using the considerable financial and reputational resources of GPA to bring investment and jobs to the Shannon region.  I was a member of the three-person group referred to at the time as the troika, comprising representatives of GPA, Lufthansa and SwissAir, that established the aircraft maintenance facility, Shannon Aerospace, employing 1,000 people.  Subsequently I worked in senior HR positions in Analog Devices in Limerick and Warner Lambert and Pfizer in Cork.  Since 2001 have worked on my own behalf as an independent human resources consultant to many employees and employers in the public and private sectors.  I am satisfied that none of these assignments presents a conflict of interest in taking on the role as chairman of Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>  I have been a member of the board of Bord na M&oacute;na since April this year and have thus had an opportunity to form a preliminary opinion of and vision for the company.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a long and honourable history and I am very conscious of its great traditions and achievements.  I pay tribute to the many thousands of women and men who over 76 years have made Bord na M&oacute;na such a highly respected company which has been fortunate in having had many inspirational leaders throughout its history.  I pay tribute especially to the outgoing chairman, Mr. Fergus McArdle, who has successfully headed the company in recent years with great skill and dedication.  Under his guidance, the managing director, Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy, has skilfully built a senior management team of exceptional individuals who, I am certain, have the capacity to lead the company to continued success in the years immediately ahead.<\/p><p>  The company, however, is at a crossroads.  This year will see it having its highest ever turnover and engage in its largest single investment in wind farms at Mount Lucas and Bruckana, but it faces a crisis owing to the poor peat harvest.  The weather this summer was the worst ever for peat harvesting and it is now expected that only 40% of the forecast production will be achieved.  Despite some diversification, peat is still the basis on which much of the business is built and this will have severe implications not just for this year but for three or four years into the future as the full effect of the reduction in stocks is felt.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is now a complex organisation of many parts and a challenge for me as chairman of the board, operating within the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, will be to ensure the board is clear about its mandate and from this to identify the various functions, roles and responsibilities entailed in the delivery of that mandate.  The board will be collectively responsible for promoting the success of the company by leading and directing its activities.  It will provide strategic guidance and monitor the activities and effectiveness of management.  It will be an important part of my role to ensure all board members act on a fully informed basis, in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best interests of the company, subject to the objectives set by the Government.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has long recognised the need to diversify its activities in order to secure a sustainable future.  It has a unique mix of assets, experience and innovation which will enable it to provide products and services which will assist in meeting Ireland's need for secure sustainable energy, while minimising environmental impact.  The company is committed to achieving its objectives in a way that is fully compatible with its vision expressed in A New Contract with Nature.

I mentioned Shannon Aerospace as the single most successful of these, but there were others also.<\/p> <p>I was part of a team that assessed projects for their economic and commercial viability.  Since then, I have held senior positions in other companies as part of a senior management team.  I think I can bring those qualities to bear on this position.  I see my role as being the chairman of the board, rather than having a personal vision.  I have to bring the board with me.  I must ensure the management brings forward the kinds of proposals that will see the company go forward.  I need to take account of and balance the claims of various stakeholders in the company.  I refer particularly to the Government and to the Minister as shareholder.  There are other stakeholders in this as well.  Some local communities depend on it.  They have contributed greatly to the success of Bord na M&oacute;na.  All of those interests have to be taken into account.  This issue has environment and energy aspects as well.

An extremely good process - the Bord na M&oacute;na deal process - is pursued by the management and the board in a rigid and disciplined manner when major investment decisions are being made.  It ensures no rash decisions are taken and everything is evaluated carefully.  As part of this fixed process, the board is told what stage each decision is at and whether it is looking good as an investment or as a way to go.

I acknowledge Mr. Horgan's comments about the history of Bord na M&oacute;na and its place as a social and economic driver in this country, especially in the midlands.  Before this week, Bord na M&oacute;na provided approximately 800 full-time and part-time jobs in my constituency.  Mr. Horgan said he sees his role as being that of a chairperson, first and foremost.  He said he will allow debate to take place and ensure that a means of making decisions is in place.  Given that he has been on the board since April, I am sure he has already formulated many opinions.  I assume he has ideas about how Bord na M&oacute;na might succeed.  He will have formed a view on how the board might direct the chief executive and the staff to drag the company back to its former greatness.  It is against that background that I would like to ask some questions and seek some opinions.  I am interested in the ideas that Mr. Horgan might bring to the fore as chairperson of the board as he seeks to maximise the company's potential and profits.  Ultimately, his goal must be to maintain the Bord na M&oacute;na jobs in the regions.<\/p><p>  It was widely known prior to this week's announcement that morale is not excessively high among the staff of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Does Mr. Horgan have an opinion on that?  Is he aware that unions at the company have circulated a motion of no confidence in the chief executive, to be taken by the board?  That development has been brought to my attention.  It is an indication that things have reached a fresh low despite the recent announcements.  Mr. Horgan mentioned that the company has approximately 1,800 staff throughout the country, across core and non-core facets of its operations.  This week's announcement affected 5% of that workforce.  As chairman designate of Bord na M&oacute;na, does Mr. Horgan feel that restructuring of this nature is fair and proportionate?  I remind the committee that 105 temporary staff are being let go and a further 90 staff, all of whom have been working in core sectors of the company, are being placed on short time.  Perhaps this measure would be seen as fairer and more proportionate if it involved some other means of bringing the wider workforce into the picture.<\/p><p>  At a meeting on 6 September last, the board was informed that savings of approximately &euro;18 million were needed following the poor harvest this year and the not-so-great harvests of previous years.  We would like to know what sort of stockpiling was carried out in previous years.  Was it sufficient to accommodate the needs of customers this winter and into next year?  I understand that a figure of &euro;24 million was mentioned at the meeting of 13 September even though the harvest had improved by 10% by that time.  The required savings had increased by &euro;6 million even though the an improvement on the expected harvest had materialised.  Why, in that context, was there such a large expectation that staff would take a further hit?<\/p><p>  The losses being incurred by non-core sectors of Bord na M&oacute;na in areas like waste management and wind energy, as opposed to its core peat production operations which remain profitable, appear to be dragging the company down.  What steps have to be taken, in Mr. Horgan's opinion, to ensure there is a focus on the core activities of Bord na M&oacute;na?  The company's asset management plan has yet to be published.  Is the board contemplating the closure of workshops?  If it is, where are those closures likely to happen?  What will those workshops be replaced by?  At what cost, in terms of funds and jobs, might all of this be done?<\/p><p>  Over the years, Bord na M&oacute;na had prided itself on the quality of its workmanship and professionalism in trades such as fitters and electricians.  Many people in the manufacturing sector throughout the country have been asking me about the noticeable fall-off in this regard.  Huge expertise has been built up over time in the training sector.  What role does Mr. Horgan envisage that this sector will have in the future?  If it is the case that these workshops are to be thinned out to such an extent, is it not fair to assume the company will not take on the number of apprentices it has taken on in the past?  If that is what will happen, I hope the board will try to find a means of collaborating with other providers of education in order to continue what has traditionally been done in this regard.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by asking about the Government's policy involving the proposed sale of State assets.  Does Mr. Horgan expect that Bord na M&oacute;na, or any parts of it, will be put up for sale in line with the Government's policy on the sale of State assets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000004#C00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1348145700,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across the Deputy.

I do not want to duplicate other questions that may be asked.  I will focus on a couple of specific areas.  Mr. Horgan said in his presentation that Bord na M&oacute;na is \"at a crossroads\".  He mentioned that it has diversified and I presume it will continue to diversify.  He referred to the company's \"largest single investment in wind farms at Mount Lucas and Bruckana\".<\/p> <p> Will Mr. Horgan comment on Bord na M&oacute;na's policy on investment in the wind energy business?  How will this policy evolve in terms of working with communities to create goodwill and encourage their involvement in the process?  The joint committee was contacted recently about a case in north County Mayo which relates to 5,000 ha of land that was compulsorily purchased in the 1950s for peat production to supply Bellacorick power station.  Part of the site was sold privately in the 1990s and last week Mayo County Council granted planning permission for the erection of wind turbines on the site.  I understand the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na plan to erect some of the highest onshore wind turbines in Europe, if not the world, on the land in question.  Each turbine will have a span equal in size to Croke Park, which is another site being discussed by everyone in the county this week for different reasons.<\/p><p> I do not have any agenda other than to ensure communities work together with those who are developing the energy resources the country needs.  We are all aware of another energy development close to the planned location where mistakes were made in the initial stages.  An issue arises because local communities and groups cannot secure planning permission to become involved in the wind energy business.  While I accept that Mr. Horgan cannot discuss this case in detail, I ask him to give a general opinion and outline how he envisages this issue developing in future.  Perhaps when he assumes office he will negotiate with communities to enable them to become involved in, buy into and support Bord na M&oacute;na's policies on wind energy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000004#C00800","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348146300,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Horgan, whose appointment will be wonderful for Bord na M&oacute;na and the country, especially given his qualifications in the area of organisational management and leading change.  His appointment comes at a time of significant challenges for the company and I wish him the best of luck in that respect.<\/p><p>  The singular message of Mr. Horgan's welcome and precise report is the need to diversify, expand and find a more sustainable foundation for Bord na M&oacute;na.  Deputy Cowen highlighted a number of issues at micro-level which involve significant changes for individuals and communities.  I ask Mr. Horgan to expand on the critical, strategic role for the company, including in the area of innovation and, in particular, big wind energy.  Will he share with us the challenges he experiences in respect of the capacity of the Government and the various agencies to react and respond in a manner that will ensure Ireland is an innovator in this area?  How can Ireland become a world leader in packaging innovation, technology and our resources, especially in light of the finite carbon energy resources available to us?  How can we maximise wind energy for job creation and as an alternative to imported energy sources in the shortest possible time?<\/p><p>  I am also interested in hearing Mr. Horgan's views on the issue of community, which is very important, and the urgent need for the Government and its agencies and organisations to respond by providing policies that will ensure a joined-up approach and prevent a scenario in which Bord na M&oacute;na is left on its own.  It is important that people are clear that the State receives a dividend from the activities of Bord na M&oacute;na.  We expect such a dividend annually and it is of great importance given the challenges facing the Exchequer. <\/p><p>  Will Mr. Horgan outline what will be his priorities for the next 18 months?  How can capital investment in big wind energy be accelerated to deliver dividends in terms of the cost of energy to consumers?  Will he also address the issue of community buy-in to wind energy projects and some of the fears that are emerging in respect of this type of investment?  There is considerable artificial resistance to everything in society.  How will the issue be moved on as quickly as possible and what are the challenges facing Mr. Horgan in that respect? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000005#D00200","speaker":"1043"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348146300,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I will first address Deputy Cowen's questions.  He asked about morale and whether I was aware of the motion circulated by the trade unions recently.  I am aware of it but do not agree with it.  I have every confidence in the managing director of Bord na M&oacute;na who has done an excellent job since his appointment.  I have observed him in action and will have a very good working relationship with him in future.  I look forward to that and do not envisage any difficulty in that respect.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the fairness of the lay-offs and cutbacks which unfortunately had to be implemented in light of the catastrophic failure of the harvest due to the weather.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in harvesting turf one needs a four-day stretch of good weather to complete a cycle.  This summer we had few extended periods of good weather.  That is the simple reason.<\/p><p>   The board has met on four occasions over the past two months and has been continuously kept up to date by management on progress on the harvest since it became apparent that there could be a problem.  We have met and continually revised the estimates of the harvest and actions that needed to be taken to mitigate the effects of these estimates.  At our most recent meeting, the board decided on a course of action that I fully support.  I have no difficulty in taking full responsibility for all the decisions the board has taken since I joined it and I will continue to take full responsibility for all decisions it makes during my membership.  <\/p><p>  While the question of fairness will arise, it is the policy of the board that decisions shall be as fair as possible and should not be targeted at particular individuals.  However, they must be effective in the prudent management of the company's resources in this extremely difficult time.  Further decisions will have to be taken in relation to the next financial year.  For the moment, I believe what we are doing this year will be sufficient for this year.  However, I cannot give any undertaking that more serious measures will not have to be taken.  Some of the solutions that were put in place in the mid-1980s, when lay-offs also occurred, are not available to the board at this stage.<\/p> <p>The Deputy rightly pointed out that there have been losses in AES, the waste recovery business that was acquired by Bord na M&oacute;na some years ago, and the company had to take a write-down on that asset this year.  Everything possible is being done to try to turn that around but it is a very difficult business to be in at the moment.  Other companies in the same business are experiencing even worse difficulties than AES because of increased landfill levies and other issues.  It is not the kind of business that Bord na M&oacute;na thought it was going to be when it took the decision to get involved in it.  That business must be turned around and will be.  <\/p><p> A question was posed regarding the closing of workshops and the asset exercise that is under way.  That is an ongoing exercise that will have to be looked at in the light of the development of works in the relevant areas.  I do not have the details of it with me but the unions and employees are being kept fully informed on the progress and the outcome will be subject to negotiation and, hopefully, agreement at an appropriate time.<\/p><p> The issue of education and the intake of apprentices was raised but I do not have information on that at the moment.  It is something I have not looked at yet but I will do so and find out how it is being managed.  I agree that it is important that Bord na M&oacute;na plays a part in the training of apprentices and the suggestion that we seek collaboration with other educational institutions is an interesting one which I will follow up on.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about my attitude to parts of the business being up for sale, which is something that I referred to in my opening statement.  We now have a very complex situation and there are lots of other interests to be taken into account in the development of Bord na M&oacute;na going forward.  The decisions on which parts are put up for sale, if any, or on whether Bord na M&oacute;na is merged with some other company - there was talk of it being merged with Coillte - are not for the board of Bord na M&oacute;na to take.  Those decisions will be taken by the Government.  I am conscious that NewERA is in place now and that any major investment decisions will go through that process as well, so it becomes quite a complex matter.  As far as the board of Bord na M&oacute;na is concerned, we want to play the fullest part we can in using the very considerable and valuable resources we have for the benefit of the communities in which it operates and of the shareholder and the country at large.  That is a very onerous responsibility but there is great potential there.<\/p><p> I will now address Deputy O'Mahony's questions.  Bord na M&oacute;na<b><\/b>was one of the first organisations to enter the wind energy business, with the development of the wind farm at Bellacorick.  I remember seeing it when it went up first and was amazed at it.  It was a very innovative idea at the time.  Bord na M&oacute;na puts a lot of emphasis on innovation and spends a very large proportion of its budget, relatively speaking, on innovation.  It has a very definite programme of innovation that is targeted and monitored by the board on a monthly basis.  As part of the board papers we get a detailed report on how many innovation projects are going on - currently over 100 - and at what stage they are at.  Innovation is absolutely crucial to the success of the company and enormous effort is put into that area.  It is very important that we work with local communities, particularly in relation to wind energy, and we will continue to do so.  We have a good track record in dealing with local communities and planning authorities with respect to large infrastructure projects.  That is a very valuable asset that exists within the competence of Bord na M&oacute;na<b><\/b>but it must be harnessed and put to work.<\/p><p> To be frank with the Deputy regarding the Mayo lands, I am not sure I fully understand all of the issues involved in that yet.  I had a very short briefing note on the matter but need to look into it further.  I assure the Deputy that I will examine it in detail and see if progress can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348146900,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Sorry Chairman, if I might just interrupt Mr. Horgan for a moment.

I understand in part, what happened.  Local landowners were refused permission in circumstances where they believed Bord na M&oacute;na would have been given planning permission or indeed, got planning permission next door and to them, that seems unfair.  I do not know all of the ins and outs of the case.  I know that much and no more.  The Deputy has drawn my attention to an issue upon which I have been partially briefed and I will give it my full attention if, or when, I become chairman.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Keaveney for his kind comments and I hope my experience in change management will be useful.  In terms of our role in wind energy, I see Bord na M&oacute;na having a huge part to play in the implementation of the national wind energy policy.  We have a lot going for us in this area.  We have a land bank that is uniquely suited to wind farms and there is a lot of work being done within Bord na M&oacute;na to identify the potential that exists, which is enormous.  We also have experience in wind farms and in generating electricity.  We have the engineers and electricians to do the work.  We also have enormous expertise in large infrastructure projects, in obtaining planning permission and so forth.  We have a great future in this area but we need to be focused in our involvement.  As to the exact way in which Bord na M&oacute;na would be involved, I am open-minded.  I do not have fixed views on whether we should get involved alone or through joint ventures.  I am in favour of leveraging all of the great advantages that we have to the maximum extent for the maximum benefit of the communities, Bord na M&oacute;na, the shareholder and the nation.  <\/p><p>  Various people have made proposals to develop very large wind farms.  The east-west interconnector is being opened this afternoon which will greatly improve the potential for the export of electricity from Ireland to the United Kingdom.  If that is to take place, I would like to see Bord na M&oacute;na have a large role in it, but it must always be based on Bord na M&oacute;na getting maximum value for the shareholder and the company. <\/p> <p>It cannot be on the basis of being in just because we have to be or being in cheap.  We must take a very hard-nosed approach and drive the best deal we can with whoever we joint venture with or share in any capacity.  This will be a big challenge for us.  We must make sure we are not taken for granted or pushed into doing something because it looks good or because someone else says we should do it.  We have to recognise the enormous value Bord na M&oacute;na has and leverage that.  That should be our approach, in a general sense. <\/p><p> The Deputy asked about my priorities.  In 18 months time, I would like to see us well advanced in that project.  It will not be built by then, of course, but I hope we will have a big and valuable stake in it.  That is one of the things I would like to see us do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348147500,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Mr. Horgan is very welcome.  I thank him for coming and offer him every good wish in the chairmanship of Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>  I would not be inclined to include on my CV the fact that I was a member of a troika, although his was a more benevolent and beneficial troika in the 1990s than the current one.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Horgan says he has full confidence in the senior management of the company.  I am aware that many in the workforce do not share that confidence.  There are allegations of widespread bullying.  Some in the workforce argue that while the weather is a factor in the current crisis facing Bord na M&oacute;na, mismanagement is also a major factor.  Some argue that unless those problems are addressed, possibly by an independent investigation, nothing will change.  I would like to hear Mr. Horgan's comments on that.<\/p><p>  Mr. Horgan, rightly, says the company is at a crossroads and needs to diversify its activities in order to secure a sustainable future.

Kerry County Council used this system in all its rural houses.  They were of a high quality and could compete with any unit being manufactured in any part of the world.  How is this business being progressed by Bord na M&oacute;na?  I believe these units were also being exported.<\/p><p>  I come from the border of Cork and Kerry.  Barna Bog is a huge disused bog in that area and was an important industry at one time.  Could the bog be developed as an amenity?  It is lying idle at present and the local community is anxious to avail of it as an officially developed amenity area, with the co-operation of Bord na M&oacute;na and possibly of Kerry County Council and local community groups such as the local Leader group, IRD Duhallow.  A huge heritage aspect attaches to the bog and it contains interesting flora and fauna.  The bog roads are in good shape although they may need some upgrading.  I ask Mr. Horgan to examine this matter, perhaps in conjunction with the local communities.  I could assist him in identifying the people with whom he could work.   <\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na used to administer a bog road grant which was widely used by people to gain access to turbary areas.  In the past ten years these roads have deteriorated seriously and are becoming impassable.  The grant was of great benefit to local communities.  Could Mr. Horgan, with the assistance of the appropriate Department, investigate this matter?  No assistance is given by county councils or Departments for the maintenance of bog roads and the grants are sorely missed.  <\/p><p>  What is the total acreage of Bord na M&oacute;na land under forestry and wind turbines?

I can say with absolute certainty that those allegations are utterly unfounded.  We have policies and procedures in place to deal with any complaint of bullying.  Moreover, these policies are being revised and will be reissued.  There is provision for independent investigations within the organisation which, as is the practice for such investigations, are conducted on a confidential basis.  This is done in accordance with good human resource practice and the guidelines laid down by the Health and Safety Authority and the Labour Relations Commission.  I reiterate emphatically that there is no widespread bullying within Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>  On the issue of peat stocks, their depletion means that Bord na M&oacute;na will eventually, in 20 or perhaps 30 years, time, have to abandon peat production almost entirely.  There are plans in place for this, including plans to remediate the cutaway bog that is left behind and find alternative uses for it.  There will be major challenges in regard to diversification, but there are processes in place to ensure Bord na M&oacute;na can deal with it in an innovative way.  We already have procedures in place by which projects can be measured in order to verify their justification.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na purchased the AES waste recovery business some years ago and, as the Deputy correctly observes, there was a write-down in our last accounts in that regard.  Our policy is to turn that business around and make it profitable.  Even if we had different plans for it, I would not be at liberty, for confidentiality reasons, to disclose them at this time.  As I said, current policy is to turn the business around.<\/p><p>  Deputy Tom Fleming asked about the new water treatment units.  A great deal of research and development has gone into progressing that project and I am happy to report that we expect to launch several products, based on new and improved technologies, later this year.  As I said, ours is an international business with operations in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Ireland.  A major programme of investment and innovation is under way and we expect to bring several successful products to market very soon.<\/p><p>  In regard to Barna bog, we would like to work with local community groups in developing it.  It is a project that must be carefully managed.  In the coming years a large number of cutaway bogs will require to be rehabilitated.  Many will flood naturally if Bord na Mona stops draining them.  They will simply return to wetlands and can be part of a diversity programme.  Some can be developed for tourism, while others may be used as water reservoirs. At Garryhinch, for example, we are developing a facility to provide water for Dublin and other parts of the eastern region.  There are many other similar projects.  Extensive work has been done in terms of what use can be made of exhausted bogs.  It was once thought they could be returned to farm land or used to plant forestry, but, unfortunately, many of those projects proved only partially or not to be successful.  However, we continue to examine all options.  We have had great success with Lough Boora, for instance, where the wetland has been turned into a nature reserve and tourist attraction.  Bord na M&oacute;na continues to invest in that facility in order to improve the visitor experience.  It is an excellent example of what can be achieved and a model for what might be done elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara had an interesting question on whether my remuneration was related to performance.  The answer is \"No.\"  As chairman designate, I receive remuneration of &euro;21,600 per annum, which I understand is a 10% reduction on the original set fee.  At the time of my appointment to the board, I was invited by the Minister to forgo the board member's fee of &euro;12,600 under the scheme in place for that purpose.  I declined to do so and I am accepting the full fees for the job.  Therefore, I receive &euro;12,600 per annum as a board member and will be in receipt of &euro;21,600 as chairman.  That remuneration is not variable and is determined by the Minister, not the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1348148100,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horgan for his attendance and wish him well in his future work with Bord na M&oacute;na.

This committee has done much to put energy on the political map, to ensure that Ireland plays its part in European energy developments and to raise awareness among colleagues.  My visit to Ireland today is a truly enriching experience.  This country plays such an important part in Europe's history, in particular as it will hold the EU-Presidency during the first semester next year and no doubt the Presidency will mean that the Government is involved in that function.  If the members look to the Lisbon treaty, they will note that we have to increasingly interconnect the Commission's work and the work of all our European institutions with that of the national parliaments.  Perhaps energy is one of the main sectors where we need a perfect partnership between member states energy policies, and energy policy on a European level.<\/p><p>  The energy sector is a long-term one which needs public private partnership, and it is not only a question of politics or markets but of both.  The first item on our agenda is investments, the second is infrastructure and the third is looking beyond 2020 at what is the long-term legal framework in the Internal Market.  As  members will know, the European Union has two fundamentals - the first is peace and freedom and the second is the Internal Market, an open market for products, wares, goods and services, a market for everybody, for all employees, without protection or subsidisation, namely, a level playing field.<\/p><p>  Energy includes the oil sector, its work and functions and also the coal sector, but electricity and gas are young latecomers to our European Union Internal Market.  We have to conclude the Internal Market and speak about what is our framework for investments beyond 2020.  There is a lack of investments.  Today was a good day for this country, the UK and for Europe as a whole.  The first east-west interconnnector is a huge investment.  It is high technology and it is a bridge to the Internal Market in practice.  However, we do not have enough investments in areas ranging from research and development to production, transport infrastructure, storage, technologies and capacities to energy efficiency.  We need more investment and investment means mainly private investments, and perhaps additional public investments from member states' budgets and from the European Union budget, but investments need long-term clarity and long-term planning security.  Nobody invests millions or billions if there is no business case for long-term investment.  We need a smart common partnership in energy to develop between members states and the European Union to achieve a confident level for private investments.  <\/p><p>  What are our instruments in this respect?  What is our legal competence on a European Union level?  First, it is the Lisbon treaty.  In this treaty there is an article to Europeanise, as it were, energy regulation, although there is one exemption.  The energy mix, namely the mix for electricity, is up to member states.  We have 14 member states using nuclear power and 13 member states avoiding nuclear power.  We have member states using coal for 90% of their electricity production while others have come down to zero in that respect.  We have member states which are pushing renewables while others are more defensive.  I was in the Baltic states in recent days and gas is dominant in those states while in other member states gas plays a smaller role.  <\/p><p>  The Lisbon treaty, beyond technology and the energy mix, provides competence to Europeanise, as it were, energy policy.  Our 20-20-20 targets, as members will know, include a 20% reductions in C02 emissions, 20% more energy efficiency and having 20% renewables in our European energy mix.  In these years we have to control what happens, or in close partnerships our member states can give some advice and some subsidisation, and we are on line to reach these three targets which will have to be realised.  <\/p><p>  Our next instrument is the Internal Market.  The Commission has to be the Internal Market police to observe if anything is working against the operating of the Internal Market rules.<\/p> <p>The Internal Market means competition, transparency, a level playing field and openness for investors in a market of 500 million consumers and without any internal border.  The interconnector is a necessary piece of infrastructure to develop market goods in the Irish market, the UK market and the European market.<\/p><p> If one compares other transport infrastructure, for decades and more recently we developed highways, railways, open airspace with hubs and regional airports, and container shipping to transport products.  We have a digital agenda for information, navigation and communication.  If one compares these other transport technologies, in terms of quality and capacity, to our existing infrastructure for gas and power, it is as though we are living on the borders of the 19th century.  There is no electricity interconnector between Spain and France.  In my home region of south-west Germany, in terms of connections to France, there are 60 bridges over the River Rhine for cars, trucks and goods but no bridge for electricity.  Lithuania has just one gas pipeline coming from Russia.  It is an isolated island that depends on Russian gas because there is no alternative.  It is necessary to diversify routes and supplies and to develop new interconnectors between member states.  That is key for this political generation.<\/p><p> We have ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G, the European association of our TSOs.  They are working closely with the Commission to develop bigger regional visions.  One region consists of Ireland, the UK, the North Sea, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.  The interconnector is just a start.  Perhaps it will need more capacity at the end of the day.  We could also look to having offshore gas pipelines and interconnectors from the UK to the Netherlands or a North Sea ring interconnecting Denmark, Germany and the UK.  There is much to do because without the newest standard of infrastructure there is no competition, there is no solidarity when needed, there is not good security of supply and we cannot invest in the best locations for renewables.  As an example, in the southern part of Germany there are many investments in onshore wind, but it is not really a windy region.  In Bavaria one has 1,800 hours a year of wind to power.  In a year there are 8,765 hours.  If I look offshore and onshore on Ireland's western border I see up to 4,000 hours of wind to power.  If we had interconnectors, a level playing field and a functioning internal market, investors would invest in this country and not in the southern part of Germany.  It is the same with solar energy and the southern part of Europe.<\/p><p> We are now developing bigger European regions for our mid-term strategies for infrastructure.  Our infrastructure package for a faster process to get permits for pipelines and grids is currently under way in the European Parliament.  Our position is that if one needs a super-grid or pipeline, between three and four years is enough to prove all arguments and offer a transparent process to citizens to decide which concrete pipeline is preferred.  It is not good to spend ten or more years discussing the alternatives.  It is not good for nature, citizens, or industry, and it is not helpful in finding a better solution.<\/p><p> In addition, in the Commission's proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, for the budget period starting in 2014 and ending in 2020, we have our programme to connect Europe's facilities.  It is about co-financing projects of common European interest.  As members are aware, the European Council gave an order to avoid isolating Ireland before the end of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348149600,"counter":859,"content":"<p>We have already had a problem today with someone leaving a mobile telephone on.

We will develop a list of priorities for the European Parliament which will go back to member states as well for a decision on which priorities should be realised in the next five to 15 years and co-financed by the European Union.<\/p><p>  My last point relates to investments, infrastructure and the framework Beyond 2020.  The 2020 targets are binding ones but the story will come to an end at the end of 2020.  My main question to member states currently is whether we need a new common approach - a new generation of ambitious but pragmatic targets.  It would not be smart to begin to focus on 2030 in 2020.  It is important to examine whether our main goal should be CO2 emissions reduction, renewables or both.  We must examine whether we should focus on efficiency or devise a scheme that is a market-based instrument to achieve pragmatic CO2 prices.  We must speak about 2030 in order to ensure long-term clarity for investors for the next decade.  It is important to do so now.  I wish to come to conclusions and binding decisions before the end of our mandate and before the next elections to the European Parliament in June 2014.<\/p><p>  There are many other points but that is enough for the moment.  It is up to members to say what they expect in terms of concrete positions.<\/p> <p>Ireland's Presidency in the first semester of 2013 is an obligation but it is a major opportunity also.

I have a number of questions.  The expectation is that the European Union as a whole is moving into a deregulated market.  Our Commission for Energy Regulation approved an increase in gas prices in particular recently and even though the market is partially deregulated there were a number of copy-cat increases by other service or product providers.  What role can the European Commission play to ensure that if we deregulate completely within the European Union we will not have price fixing, for want of a better term, or a cartel but absolute competition within the energy market?  The United States and Japan have consistently lower gas prices than the European Union.  What steps can be taken at a European level to ensure the raw material is at the lowest possible price?<\/p><p>  Mr. Oettinger spoke about renewables.  Ireland has been going down the path of renewables in every community and county at various levels.  I understand the total budget for renewables is 3.7%.  Does the European Commission have any plans to target more resources to individual business or even individual house owners to encourage them to go down the route of renewables and direct the grant subsidy to the smaller micro-businesses or communities rather than to multiples or large corporations?  There would be a better take-up of it if that were done.<\/p><p>  On Monday the European Commission came out with new legislative proposals on the bio-industry, and it has spoken about removing the funding from that post-2020.  Following the exit of our country from beet production we have done numerous feasibility studies and reports on renewable energy including ethanol, bioethanol and so forth.  Is this measure not a retrograde step? Our entire community is dependent on oil, and I believe 84% of the raw material for energy comes from outside the European Union.  Is that sustainable?  Will Dr. Oettinger explain the Commission's decision announced on Monday regarding biofuels?<\/p><p>  Is there any scope within the Commission's programme for recovery?  The Commissioner's stated objective on that point is for growth and job creation.  Is there a specific programme within that?  If we consider co-financing, this country is co-operating with Europe on austerity programmes to a major extent and we will be looking for more flexibility from Europe and more co-financing in regard to investment.  There are people who are willing to invest in alternative energy across this country and more could be done in that regard.  The Commissioner might answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000012#L00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1348150200,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner to Ireland and thank him for his direct and pragmatic approach.

Would the EU and the Commissioner's office consider a greater investment in the development of sustainable energy in the member states?  In terms of our targets that are set out, we may need more encouragement and finance for private-public investment in the member states to make that switch to renewable energy.<\/p><p>  Can the Commissioner confirm that it will remain at the discretion of member states as to the type of energy they will be using into the future, whether it is oil, gas, renewables or whatever?  The discretion in that regard will remain with the member states and nobody from Europe will dictate the form of energy generation that is to be used in the member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000012#L00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348150200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Let me compare energy prices and global markets.  Japan is not a problem for Europe because it has so many imports; it must buy more and more gas.  Its price for electricity is higher than our price in Europe.  It does not have any fuels of its own.  It is a big, isolated island.  There is no co-operation with anybody - North or South Korea, China or Vietnam.  Japan has no advantage in terms of the energy price related to Europe and it will abandon nuclear power.  It will not reactivate all existing power plants and therefore energy is no argument to be investing in Japan.<\/p> <p> The United States is increasingly producing its own oil.  It is accepting some environmental risks, as in the Gulf of Mexico.  Its producers are entering deep water to drill, producing sand oil and fracking for oil.  The United States has a lower tax rate and only some imports.  By producing its own oil it has a big advantage relative to countries in Europe regarding the transport sector and other industries.  In former times it imported large volumes of gas from Qatar and Nigeria.  Now it does not need any gas from third states and will begin to export shale gas next year.  The price of gas in the United States is 25% of that in Europe.  There is, therefore, a big advantage.  The reindustrialisation of the United States is a prospect and I regard the deindustrialisation of Europe as a danger.<\/p><p> A point was made on elasticity in taxation and pricing.  There are two points of note on higher energy prices.  First, the higher the price, the more efficient the consumption.  This was a strategy.  High energy prices make one more careful about using energy and one avoids energy consumption.  Second, whenever a Minister for Finance had a problem with his budget, he developed a new energy tax.  Increasingly, this practice is ceasing.  I have two examples.  In France the new President, Mr. Hollande, made a regulation to reduce the cost of petrol and diesel by six cent - three cent from the national budget and three cent from the market.  As the market leader is state owned, it is just a public decision.  A period of three months applies and it is a question of politics.  This runs contrary to what occurred in former times.  In Germany the Bundesrat, the second Chamber, asked the Chancellor to reduce taxation on electricity to strike a balance in respect of the increasing volume of renewables and higher guaranteed feed-in tariffs for renewables investment.  Increasingly, Europe must work actively to avoid the next steps leading to higher energy prices.<\/p><p> We need more industries in Europe.  It would be wrong to deindustrialise it.  I refer to the production of steel, copper and aluminium and to the chemical, paper, textile and high-tech textile industries, for example.<\/p><p> With regard to regulation and the market, it is our obligation to reduce regulation.  Let me be very frank: member states and the Commission may have varying positions.  Increasingly, we develop regulated markets through nuanced market design.  \"Market design\" is a wonderful term.  I refer to subsidies, preferences in regard to infrastructure, feed-in tariffs and guaranteed prices, etc.  On the subject of harmonising regulation, we ought to be more defensive in approaching new proposals.  This should be a common approach in the European Union.  We should be more critical of new proposals on regulation.<\/p><p> What can the Commission do?  If member states accept our proposal for the next MFF for seven years, they will note three main programmes.  First, there is some &euro;9 billion available to connect countries in Europe.  Second, there is &euro;6 billion available for energy research in partnership with member states with a view to securing public-private projects.  Third, there is up to &euro;17 billion in the Cohesion Fund for our structural programmes.  This is mainly to achieve energy efficiency in existing buildings.  If a mayor of a city wishes to renovate a quarter of his or her downtown area, he or she can get money from the European Union budget.  He or she must co-finance it using his or her own budget or that of his or her state.  It is also a question of co-financing in order that private investors can renovate existing buildings in the best way to achieve energy efficiency which will be one of the main priorities in the next period in our cohesion programmes.<\/p><p> Consider wind power and the means of comparing investment and costs.  The answer will depend not only on wind energy production but also on the oil price in 2020.  With oil prices expected to increase step by step and peak oil perhaps behind us, renewables will become increasingly attractive.  However, the price increases are not certain.  The price of gas is decreasing and the Americans are using their own gas sources and do not need as much coal as they did in the last decade.  Therefore, the price of coal on the global market is decreasing.  Perhaps not in Denmark or Austria but in the global market fossil fuel prices are competitive.<\/p><p> We need some subsidies for renewables.  The first need concerns infrastructure.  Bearing in mind the nature of wind generation, one needs additional grid infrastructure where normally one would not need a grid.  Infrastructure provision is a public obligation.  The EU budget is to be co-financed by member states.  Not all of the investment but some may be in our common interest.  Second, there is a need for research.  Research programmes on the newest renewable technologies are necessary for us to be more competitive in generation.<\/p><p> Perhaps we need some guarantees, or feed-in tariffs, but there ought to be a reduction.  I accept the need for public expenditure on renewables but not as a never-ending story.<\/p> <p>It should be combined with a clear strategy because at the end of the day renewables must be market-based.  They must be competitive in the market and not depend for their entire lifetime on public expenditure.  Therefore, we undoubtedly need the best locations.  Photovoltaic production in Dublin is not meaningful, but it is in Madrid or in partnership with Morocco.  Similarly, wind energy production in the North Sea and the Atlantic will be perfect in the long term.  I am sure investment costs for offshore wind parks will fall.  We have more and more experience of how to install them with specialised ships and greater expertise.  Increasing numbers of companies are engaged and competition means lower prices.  However, a period of approximately five to ten years will be needed, after which I hope offshore wind parks can be as competitive as onshore wind parks at the best locations increasingly are.<\/p><p> As for biomass, it has not been forgotten.  Perhaps it will be considered in the next round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348151400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and his officials and thank him for his presentation.  The situation in the Middle East is volatile and could threaten the availability of oil reserves.  While it probably would have a huge impact worldwide, given the dire economic and financial straits in which we find ourselves, it certainly would have a major retrograde effect on this country.  Today members received a report on oil security from the International Energy Agency and I wish to ascertain whether the Commissioner is satisfied with the level of Ireland's national reserves.  Will it be able to withstand a dramatic fall in supplies?  I hope this will not happen, but in the event that there is a sudden lack of availability, would we be able to withstand it?  I ask because Ireland is on the periphery of Europe and this emphasises the point on renewable energy.  As it is located on the edge of the Atlantic, Ireland probably has the best conditions for both wind energy and wave energy production; the latter certainly has huge potential off the coastline.  Is the Commission setting down standards whereby Ireland should develop priorities in respect of the various factors mentioned and given the availability of energy resources?  We probably should try to capitalise on all of these sources.  Wave power also should be considered in addition to wind energy.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Shannon LNG project in the south west - in County Kerry to be precise.  As the Commissioner might be aware, the project proposes the importation, storage and distribution of liquefied natural gas, but it is running into huge impediments.  An investment of &euro;1 billion is planned and the project has much potential for job creation.  While the particular region to which I refer needs such investment, bureaucracy is preventing the development from moving.  I ask the Commissioner to investigate to ascertain whether he can use his good offices to have the project expedited.  I refer to setting it up and getting it going.  <\/p><p>  As for our gas and oil fields and the potential therein off Ireland's southern and western coasts, I note there have been agreements with multinational oil exploration companies.  However, Ireland does not appear to be realising the maximum financial gain from these interested bodies.  In the Commissioner's opinion, can we renegotiate any deal done in the past in long-term negotiations?  It does not appear we will get the amounts in royalties we should in the event that such resources are eventually brought onshore in viable quantities in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000014#N00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1348151400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Commissioner and hope he enjoys his time in Ireland.  I am interested to note his background is as a tax consultant and I am sure members would have loved to have the opportunity to find out what were his views on Irish taxation policy in the light of our economic problems.  Many of the questions have had a local dimension and I note that, politically, the Commissioner started out as a town councillor and then as a district councillor.  Consequently, he will be very familiar with local issues.  <\/p><p>  My questions are related specifically and solely to hydraulic fracturing in the context of increased dependency in Europe on fossil fuels and a lower investment programme.  The Commissioner has noted that as a result of the economic downturn Europe-wide there has been lower investment in renewable energy production, and he has touched on a serious issue.  I also noted the references made by him to shale gas production in the United States.  In that context, is there not then a temptation for countries in Europe to consider shale gas extraction as a way out of the energy crisis that appears to be developing?  How advanced are the Commission's deliberations in formulating a European Union-wide policy, which I presume will emerge from the Commissioner's directorate?  Is he involved in discussions on fracking at European Union level?  What timeline is envisaged before the Commission issues its proposals which were initiated last year in a report on the environmental impact of fracking?  Has the Commissioner seen the report?  Has he submitted observations on fracking to his Commission colleagues in that context?  Has he answered questions on fracking submitted by MEPs?  <\/p><p>  I ask these questions to get some context in respect of this growing issue.  It is extremely controversial in the region from which my colleague Deputy Michael Colreavy and I come, in the north west of the country.  It is so controversial that in the absence of relevant and up-to-date technological data, any attempt to grant a licence for the development of hydraulic fracturing in the area would be met with extremely stiff resistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000014#N00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348151400,"counter":871,"content":"<p>First, in respect of biofuel, as members are aware, we have a binding target of 10%.  By 2020, 10% of the transport sector overall - that is, railways, trucks, buses, aeroplanes and cars - should be powered by sustainable energy.  One option is electromobility, but reaching a figure of 10% in eight years is not feasible.  A target of 1% would be much more feasible; while electromobility will have a future, it needs a period of 20 to 40 years.  Consequently, biofuel use is just one answer.  We had an obligation to bring forward a report and make proposals on what went wrong.  We perceive two problems in biofuel industries.  First, some imports from Brazil, Nigeria and the United States are not really sustainable.  If one considers Brazil, existing fields for agriculture are being used for biofuel production, but as there is a need for food, people go into forests to activate new fields for new agricultural investments.<\/p> <p>Imports have to be sustainable.  Oil imports alone are not acceptable.<\/p><p> The next point relates to first and second generation energy resources.  We are holding to the 10% level.  We are saying that up to 2020 just 5% can come from first generation resources and that additionally up to 5% has to come from biomass and second generation resources.  The Commission wants to take these two binding decisions to balance what is going the wrong way with what should be brought back to an environmental and sustainable position.  An EU regulation means every member state has to store 90 or more days of its oil consumption.  We have realised this target.  We have perfect systems to transport oil in pipelines and trucks, etc.  We have 90 days' supply in each of the 27 member states.  It is a perfect system.  When there were no oil imports from Libya last year, it was not really a problem for Italy.  The oil ban on Iran announced in July has not affected Greece and Italy.  We have a functioning market, with solidarity between member states.  Therefore, security of supply to the market is guaranteed and there is no need to open our storage capacity to bring supplies into the market.  Saudi Arabia is producing more oil than ever.  It is bringing volumes to the market at a time when Iran is not as active as an exporter to the European Union.  There is some debate between the United States and the International Energy Agency.  The Commission and member states have to reflect on what should be done.  There is an argument that increasing oil prices to bring more volumes to the market could be a way of reducing the price of oil.  There is no really binding argument for the opening of our storage capacity.  There is an open debate between the United States, the International Energy Agency and us, and I hope it is a rational one.  As there are elections in Washington, we will wait and see.<\/p><p> What is the role of gas production?  That is an important question.  There is no doubt that gas is a perfect partner for renewables because it is environmentally friendly and flexible.  As a power source it is more flexible than a coal or nuclear power plant can be.  Our strategy is to diversify sources and tools for gas supply.  We have new LNG terminals and new pipelines.  We have to open new regions such as the southern corridor with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.  I do not know what the concrete business case is for the Irish LNG terminal.  We have to look at issues such as what is subsidised, whether there is a problem with our internal market rules, whether there is a business case, whether there is enough consumption and the relationship with the pipeline.  In general, in Europe there is not enough infrastructure.  We need more LNG terminals, more pipelines and more storage capacity.  I cannot say which one is the most important.  The European Union cannot reach all of its goals without new infrastructure.  Germany does not have its own LNG terminal.<\/p><p> The EU gas market needs 530 billion cu. m of gas each year in order to meet consumption levels.  According to our outlook, that figure will increase to 600 billion cu. m.  Our own gas resources will come to an end in the years to come.  The United Kingdom will stop supplying gas in the next decade and the Netherlands will stop some years later.  Some 64% of the gas used in the European Union is imported from third states.  This means that 36% comes from our own resources.  Our Russian partners are our most relevant partners.  Every year some 140 billion cu. m comes from Gazprom sources to us.  Norway is in second position and Algeria, third.  When our own resources come to an end, we will need an additional 180 billion cu. m each year.  This volume should not be imported from Mr. Putin; rather, it should come from Qatar and Nigeria by ship to our LNG terminals, or it should come from shale gas.  Shale gas is not the perfect answer when we are trying to avoid imports.  It is not a replacement source of energy; rather, it is an additional source.  If some volumes come from shale gas, that will be welcome.  We are comparing demonstration projects and looking at all reports.  We are comparing and analysing them.  That work is being done by my colleague, Janez Poto\u010dnik, and me.  Some regions in the European Union are sensitive for reasons relating to nature and soil, etc., and there are other regions where we could test this.  Perhaps Poland is in the leading position.<\/p><p> My advice would be not to make any decision for the next decade.  Ireland should be open and flexible.  Perhaps it will be in a better and more competent position in three to five years, time.  Some experts and engineers have said to me that in five or ten years, time all we will need is water and pressure.  We will not need chemicals.  That is different from today.  Perhaps some demonstration projects in Poland will inspire more confidence among citizens and bring more clarity to the issue across Europe.  It is not necessary to enter this market now.  However, it would be wrong to decide, now and forever, that there would be no shale gas used anywhere in the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348152000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>Conversely, it would be wrong to commit to using shale gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092000015#O00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348152000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Yes.
