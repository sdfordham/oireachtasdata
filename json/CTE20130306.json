We circulated a submission, but there was a slight misunderstanding in that regard.  We understood our submission was to be made in the context of <i>The Spirit Level<\/i>; therefore, there are a number of references to that book, which might seem somewhat strange.  However, we can explain them as we move along.<\/p><p>  Essentially, we want to talk about the way in which the recession has affected poverty levels and impacted on equality in Ireland.  The members of the European Anti-Poverty Network in Ireland are local, community-based anti-poverty groups throughout the country and national organisations dealing with issues such as homelessness and groups such as Travellers and lone parents, as well as community development projects, family resource centres and so forth.  Members come together in our network to find ways of influencing policy and putting the fight against poverty at the top of the Irish and European agendas.   We are very concerned that  while there has been a lot of talk about the importance of protecting the most vulnerable since 2008 and the onset of the recession, in practice, according to our members and all available statistics, the issue of poverty is sliding down the agenda.  <br \/><i>The Spirit Level<\/i>, by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, talks about the importance of equality to the whole of society.  It argues that more equal societies, in almost all cases, are more successful in being more cohesive and having better health outcomes, not just for people experiencing poverty but for all of society.  Physical and mental health tends to be better, while levels of crime and imprisonment are much lower in more equal societies.  Issues such as drug abuse are very much symptoms of unequal societies.  The issue of trust is very closely linked, as one would expect, with how equal or divided a society is.  Our members' experience is that these issues have a particular resonance for those living on very low incomes, suffering discrimination, living in communities with high levels of long-term unemployment and affected by poverty in different ways.<\/p><p>  Ireland has a reputation across Europe because of a number of very important innovations introduced by various Governments during the years which have been copied in other countries.  I refer specifically to strategies to fight poverty, both in targeting areas of disadvantage and in producing overall national strategies.  This dates back to the poverty programmes introduced during the time of the late Deputy Frank Cluskey in the 1970s which were initiated by Ireland and taken up across Europe.  This was the very first attempt to put serious money behind communities to help them to solve their own problems, as opposed to communities simply relying on services being provided for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Hanan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362575700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>That would be good.

It has become a broader way of distributing food surpluses and giving specific aid.  This is a useful time to consider the scheme because it is being re-written at European level.  Ireland has special access to the debate because our Dublin MEP, Emer Costello, is acting as rapporteur to the Bill.  We had been very involved in the debate.  One of our main concerns is that any new scheme coming through should not take away from long-term development.  There has been a debate within the European Commission and at the European Council, especially during the budget debate, about whether the money for this fund, which is effectively an emergency aid fund for the most disadvantaged, should be taken out of the European Social Fund.  As far as we are concerned it is most important that the two are dealt with separately because it does not make sense to provide food aid to people but not the long-term supports and serious solutions which can help them to move out of poverty.<\/p><p>  We are keen for the scheme to be used in a way that allows organisations which are distributing food aid and other types of aid - the scheme is now broader than simply food aid - to see it as the beginning of a longer-term engagement with people in need.  It should not simply be a matter of giving a food package to someone who is homeless.  We should use it as an opportunity to talk to that person about how he can access housing and welfare and how he can begin to get his life in order in terms of education, drug abuse and so on.  It is important that the aid is distributed to organisations which have the capacity to work in this way or, at least, which have thought about how to do that properly.<\/p><p>  We believe it is important that the programme is not confined entirely to food aid.  There is a scheme here, the Bia Food Bank initiative, which has made a proposal to the committee that some of the money should be used to set up an infrastructure for distributing aid but also used for what is known in Scotland, where this is done rather well, as start-up packs.  This means a person does not simply get food but also the things he needs to start a new independent life.  The idea is to help such a person back on the road to an independent life.  The monitoring mechanisms put in place should involve organisations with a broad interest in helping people out of homelessness and poverty, as well as the Departments involved in distributing the food and the monitoring committees at local level.  These are some of the concerns we have brought to the committee.  Some weeks ago we sent in a submission in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Ginnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We have received the submission.

What type of deprivation is being experienced?  How has it changed since the recession began in the past five years?  The national anti-poverty strategy stipulates a requirement for poverty-proofing.  I am interested in hearing the views of the delegates on how this operates.  A number of measures have been introduced and it is not clear how they are being poverty-proofed.  I refer in particular to the property tax which is applicable to all property, regardless of the income of the family involved.  I wonder how that would pass muster with any poverty-proofing.  I do not think poverty-proofing is given high priority in some of the measures which are being introduced.  I ask the delegates to explain their views on the strategy.<\/p><p>  The EAPN proposes that taxes should be increased.  I ask for information on those proposals.  The social welfare system is the safety net for families dealing with unemployment who do not have any other means of looking after themselves.  I ask the delegates to speak about the contrast between the system here and the British system.  There is a difference in the level of benefits paid.  The payments are much lower in the British social welfare safety net.  What are the consequences for levels of poverty here and in our nearest neighbour and in the Six Counties?  I am interested in hearing further details about the types of deprivation and how these have changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600005#F00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I missed the presentation by the delegates but I read the written submission and the reports.  I refer to Deputy McConalogue's question about a comparison of welfare rates in different jurisdictions.  It is too simplistic to say that people here get a higher rate of social welfare payment than in another jurisdiction.  One needs to take into account all the other elements that make up the total benefit.  I refer, for example, to housing supports and housing grants.  I have looked at the six steps to a more equal and inclusive Ireland and one step is to increase the overall tax take.  It is not just a case of increasing the tax take but also how it is distributed subsequently.  I ask the delegates for their views.<\/p><p>  I note the EAPN has argued for the introduction of progressive property taxes.  It is an appropriate subject for discussion because the property tax is currently in the Seanad, having been passed in the D&aacute;il.  I ask the EAPN to give us any information on how property taxes are redistributed in other jurisdictions compared to what is being proposed here.  The proposal is that they will be given back to the local authorities who will decide how they are to be spent.  Is that how it works in other jurisdictions?  In some areas the taxes collected are ring-fenced for expenditure on education or health or put into a national pot rather than being given back to the local authorities to provide services at a local level.  I ask for information on the practice in other European countries.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600005#F00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  I will not repeat the points already raised by other members.  The points speak for themselves and I await the answers.<\/p><p>  I am constantly hearing that the Irish social welfare rates are very high.  However, the cost of living in Ireland must be taken into consideration.  The rates are lower in other countries but so too is the cost of living in other countries.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot lower the rates of social welfare while the cost of living is high.  That would drive people into poverty.  We have been told that any figure below &euro;25,000 for a couple with children will drive them into poverty.  In my view, &euro;25,000 is a very low figure, especially when a mortgage has to be paid.  A lot of working people in this country - not just people on social welfare - are driven into poverty now because they are unable to meet their bills and they are not entitled to any benefits.  They do not qualify for any aid, such as rent supplement, simply because they are working.  <\/p><p>  It is distressing to note that food aid includes butter and rice.  It reminds me of the days when people queued at local authority offices for the intervention beef.  It is degrading, to say the least, for people to have to do that.  I am sure there will be a different method of distribution used now.  I ask the delegates to elaborate on a new, more flexible method to be introduced.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600005#F00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their attendance and for making their presentation.  I agree with them that budgets should be poverty-proofed.  Unfortunately, this was not done in the last budget but I will definitely push for it to be done in the next budget.<\/p><p>  Fuel poverty is a very big issue which is of concern to me.  There is no regulation of the fuel industry.  The four major fuel suppliers can put the prices up or down as they wish.  I have argued this point on local radio and at national level.  I also asked the Minister for Finance to consider reducing VAT on fuel to alleviate the suffering of people paying high fuel costs in the hard winter months.  I asked if he could reduce the VAT for three to four months of the year.  He replied that Europe was looking for a higher rate to cover the carbon footprint.  Home heating oil currently costs &euro;1.02 a litre.  Young families are facing poverty trying to heat their homes.  I will be pushing the Minister again on this issue.  I will ask him for a VAT reduction during the three to four hard winter months in order to alleviate some of the pressure on people.  I ask for the views of the delegates on the fuel issue.<\/p><p>  On the issue of food aid and the use of intervention food I agree that it should not be just a parcel of food and no more.  It needs to be long-term aid.  I agree with Senator Moloney that a system of distribution needs to be established.  We all saw the long queues in the 1980s and 1990s outside the St. Vincent de Paul offices or the local parish hall as people waited for their food parcels.  It is very degrading.  I agree with the suggestion of starter packs.  Many people are in financial difficulties as a result of the recession.  The system of social protection is very confusing.  People do not know what stamp they are paying.  It is very difficult to know what are one's entitlements because the information is not easily accessible.  I would like to see the Department of Social Protection giving information on the grades of stamps so that people will be familiar with their entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600005#F00700","speaker":"1079","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362576900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the questions and refer the remainder to Mr. Ginnell, who has a better head for figures than I.  The European Anti-Poverty Network comes out of the poverty programmes to which I referred earlier and was established across Europe as a network of organisations working against poverty on the ground.  Many of these would be local community initiatives, some are housing organisations and others are national organisations, such as the Simon Community, Threshold, OPEN, the lone parents group, the Irish Traveller Movement and Pavee Point.  This range of organisations originally wanted to raise issues of poverty at European level together.  The Irish arm of the European Anti-Poverty Network was established to assist organisations in impacting on European policy.<\/p><p>  Most of the European policies, etc., with which we deal - whether they are the social inclusion strategies or issues relating structural funds, employment and so on - are closely linked to national policies.  We now work as much on national policies as we do on European ones.

We have a particular involvement with people who live on the front line.  We assist in organising European meetings of those who experience poverty.  We have the same type of processes at national level whereby we encourage those who are affected by policies to contribute to the policies we develop and then bring to entities such as this committee.  We are part of a Europe-wide network, which has a presence in all EU member states and in a number of countries outside the Union.  Together, we try to co-ordinate policy and influence across the EU.<\/p><p>  Our funding is very small but we try to use it effectively.  We have a great deal of volunteer support from our active members.  At European level, most of the funding for our network comes from the European Commission.  The latter supports our head office in Brussels.  At national level, we receive a small Government grant under the scheme to support networks and community organisations.  From time to time, we also take on specific funded educational projects, policy projects, research projects and so on.  Obviously, we compete for funding in respect of these.  We run a very modest office, with two part-time staff.  However, we also have many volunteers from our member organisations.<\/p><p>  On the issue of welfare rates in Ireland, it is very difficult to make direct comparisons across countries.  One of the reasons we fall back on different measures of poverty and inequality is because the conditions are very different.  Many European countries invest a great deal more in universal free services.  In the more equal and successful countries, therefore, people have high-quality health care, high-quality and cheap transport, high-quality and cheap education, etc.  In Ireland, many of these services have tended to be two-tier in nature or divided.  Mr. Ginnell will be more familiar with the actual figures, etc., relating to the comparisons between welfare rates.  We tend to compare ourselves with the UK as opposed to our continental European counterparts.  The situations in the UK and Ireland are quite different.  The UK was starting from a very strong base of a relatively well-developed welfare state in terms of both services - housing, health, etc. - and actual supports and payments.  Ireland started from a much lower base a couple of decades ago.  We have been gradually developing a stronger base, while - to put it in very crude terms with regard to many of the measures involved - the UK has been cutting back.  If we are passing somewhere in the middle, it is not necessarily because we are moving fast.  Rather, it is often because rates are falling in the UK.  There are very different models in continental Europe - the Nordic model, the southern model and so on - for the way in which services and welfare are developed.<\/p><p>  I am glad reference was made to people at work, which is probably the most important aspect.  I did not cover this matter in my initial comments but reference to it is contained in our submission.  One of the most shocking figures to emerge from the most recent press release from the CSO is that which shows that since 2008 the number of people at work who suffer from the relevant deprivation indicators - these are very basic things such as not being able to heat one's home, not being able to afford a warm coat, etc. - has more than doubled to 15%.  This indicates that we must look closely not just at wages and conditions but also at the way in which work is organised.<\/p><p>  As members will be aware, there has been a move towards casual work.  These means that people are on-call for a couple of hours a week rather than being in a position to take on either regular part-time or full-time jobs.  Many conditions which, in the past, we would have considered to have been very basic have been eroded during the recession.  We must consider how to rebuild these as the most successful societies in Europe and those which have emerged best from the recession - the Scandinavian countries, Austria and so forth - have done.  Those states have protected conditions and retained their competitiveness as a result of the quality of work they offer and also the quality of the training, supports and security they can provide to people in work through better conditions.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to housing.  We agree that there are many problems with regard to homelessness, particularly in terms of people living on the streets but even more so in the context of those living in inadequate accommodation.  A couple of years ago many of our national member organisations - Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, etc. - would have stated that the biggest problem which arose was the transition from temporary accommodation to serious long-term and independent accommodation.  Now, we are discussing street homelessness.  The position with regard to accessing housing is becoming worse and this is despite the number of empty properties throughout the country.<\/p><p>  We support the views that have been aired at this committee - they also have the support of the troika and our specialist organisations - to the effect that we should move away from the type of social housing structures which are in place at present towards a system which would be more like a modernised version of traditional council housing.  Under such a system, people would be able to pay rent according to their means rather than having their rent supplement cut off when they take up employment.  The latter is the cause of one of the big poverty traps because it actually prevents people from taking up employment.  In a study we compiled a number of years ago, we discovered that one of the greatest obstacles to people taking up employment is the fear of losing rent supplement.  There is a serious need to make the switch to which I refer.  It appears technical and administrative in nature but it would make all the difference.<\/p><p>  The fund for emergency aid is the subject of complete reconsideration at present.  The proposal from the European Commission - which is before the European Parliament and in respect of which this committee has an input - suggests slight changes and these would bring about improvements to the system.  We have always been slightly dubious about the idea of food aid.  As someone stated, in addition to being degrading, handing someone a packet of food is not a long-term solution to poverty.  However, some of our member organisations - such as the Capuchin Day Centre and others who are involved in giving out food - have indicated that the number of people seeking such services has more than trebled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Hanan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362577500,"counter":24,"content":"<p>A range of questions covering a number of areas asked.  On one of the questions relating to child poverty, I do not know if members have seen the report of the survey of income and living conditions from the Central Statistics Office which was released recently.  One of the statistics contained in it is that the overall material deprivation level for the population is about a quarter.  Therefore, nearly 25% of the population now experience material deprivation, and 32% of children up to age of 17 experience material deprivation.  If we consider this across all measurements for poverty, children experience higher levels of poverty to a great extent.  With regard to the reasons for that, another report by the ESRI and the Department of Social Protection released recently examined the issue of in-work poverty and low work intensity.  It was clear that poverty levels were higher among those in work within families with children.  Even for some families for whom there is a certain amount of work, children experience high levels of poverty, particularly where there is a low level of work intensity.  Families are greatly affected by unemployment in a household.  It is clear that children also experience poverty.  One of the groups that experiences the highest levels of poverty are lone-parent families.  The children within those households are at greater risk of poverty.  There are a number of types of household that experience high levels of poverty and, within those, families with children are at higher risk.<\/p><p>  The importance of social welfare provision was raised, and my colleague Mr. Robin Hanan has dealt with that.  It is difficult to make comparisons as there are different levels of service provision in different countries, not only with regard to the level of social welfare support but also with regard to the types of service people can access.  While social welfare rates are lower to a great extent in the UK and that is an issue there, for example, in regard to health, housing and child care, it has a higher level of services in those areas, which support people in different ways.  However, in Ireland social welfare levels increased significantly, particularly in the 2000s, and that played a great role in reducing poverty here.  The survey of income and living conditions shows what the poverty level would be if the social welfare transfers that have been received were taken out of the equation.  In 2004, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would have been nearly 40% if social welfare supports had been removed.  In 2011, the rate would have been over 50%.  Therefore, social welfare transfers play a very important role in reducing poverty levels.  There are issues outside the area of transfers, but social welfare plays an important role in keeping down poverty rates.  It is important to understand social welfare provision in that context as well.<\/p><p>  Members may be aware of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which has done considerable work in examining minimum income standards for different types of household, irrespective of the source of income, and the level of income those family types would need to receive in order to live with dignity.  The partnership has shown that people would not be living with dignity if they were solely dependent on social welfare supports.  Even in the case of some types of family in which a family member has work, especially if it is part-time, they would not be receiving enough income to live with dignity or up to a standard that is considered normal or good for society.<\/p><p>  Other issues with regard to taxation were raised.  Taxation is an issue, with the recent proposals to introduce water charges and property taxation and a number of increases in taxation.  Ireland's overall tax take is at the bottom end compared to other member states of the EU.  If we consider the type of society we want to create and look to the Scandinavian countries, which have a higher level of taxation, and how that money is redistributed - a point that was also raised during the discussion - the key to that is to raise our tax levels over time to levels that better reflect the European level of taxation.  Currently we are about 10% lower in GDP terms than the average level in the EU.  There is an issue in that respect, but the question is how it would be done.<\/p><p>  The Community Platform produced a report at the end of 2011 on the introduction of a more progressive tax system.  It outlined a programme on how such a tax system would be developed, examined issues such as property tax and wealth tax - which would focus not only on a person's home but also on other types of property as well as assets and savings - and how a more progressive taxation system might be put in place, taking those issues into account.  Recently a number of changes have been made in regard to tax reliefs and people at the upper end of the income scale avail of tax reliefs to a greater extent.  Addressing a number of those - for example, those relating to pensions - would be a way to bring more equality into the tax system.  There are proposals in this respect.  In the current crisis we must examine how we can do that in a way that does not create greater levels of poverty.  As was said, poverty impact assessment of tax decisions is extremely important.  Mr. Hanan has covered the issue of poverty impact assessments in the past.  It is a question of examining how different policies are being designed and planned and the impact they will have on different groups in society in terms of their incomes and so on.  <\/p><p>  One of the areas we have raised a good deal recently, and on which the committee has produced a report, is the proposal from the Department of Social Protection to have a single working age payment.  We raised a number of concerns about that.  While we would be broadly supportive of it, we have a number of concerns about how it might be implemented in that it could create poverty traps for lone parents, people with disabilities and a number of other groups on whom such changes would have an impact.  We fully support this committee's report on a single working age payment, which highlights that now is not the time to introduce it.  If such a payment were to be introduced, we would need to examine issues of income and the services and supports groups would need if they were to move in a proper way from social welfare supports into decent work.  The committee highlighted the fact that in the current context there are very few jobs available, and many services and supports are being cut.  If we want to put in place an adequate system, which is needed, now is not the time to do that.  <\/p><p>  We were disappointed and concerned about the change in the age threshold for the youngest child for whom lone parents can receive the one-parent family payment, which has now come into law, and also about changes in income disregards.  While the intention of those changes is probably to achieve a system that supports lone parents in accessing work, they have resulted in increased poverty levels and act as a barrier to lone parents in accessing work.  Income disregards played a role in allowing lone parents to afford child care supports, as child care provision is quite expensive and there is low level of adequacy in terms of provision.  The income disregard allowed lone parents to access employment while covering the cost of child care until their income achieved a certain level at which they no longer needed the income disregard.  Changing elements such as the income disregards creates an extra poverty trap and a barrier to accessing employment.  In regard to poverty impact assessments, those are a number of the issues to be examined in order to specifically identify the areas of policy concerned and analyse them in terms of the impact the changes will have on the group concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Ginnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will allow members to contribute and I have a couple of questions myself.

They apply for council housing but because their children might already be housed in a council house with their mother they are not allowed to include the children as applicants on a housing list.  Fathers are then forced to rent privately, which is driving them into poverty because it is difficult for separated fathers to rent a two-bedroom house or three-bedroom house to accommodate their children in addition to paying maintenance and looking after the welfare of their children.  It is not possible for them to do so.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to poverty traps and rent allowance.  Unless we deal with such issues from a policy point of view then we will never lift those individuals out of the situation.  We can invest as much money as we like in housing but we are not taking into account the needs of those on the waiting list.  The standard build is a two-bedroom house or a three-bedroom house.  We take into account the number of people on the waiting list and the number of houses that are needed but we are not looking at the type of builds we need to put in place.  There is no mixture of build types, which will be different in every local authority.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing does not appear to have a strategy in place to examine the needs of people on the housing waiting list.

Reference was made in the presentation to the political contribution to the fund.  It was said that the continued focus on food aid is also important but it can only be of real value to Ireland if there is also support to develop a delivery infrastructure such as a food bank, as has been proposed.  Could the witnesses provide more detail on what the infrastructure might entail and the related costs?  What were the problems with the previous scheme and how will the new scheme improve on it?<\/p><p>  I agree with the notion that income equality is important in reducing poverty.  Relative poverty and income equality seem to be important in terms of outcomes for society according to the book by Professor Wilkinson that was mentioned.  The previous survey on income and living conditions that was published showed that the Gini co-efficient did not increase between 2010 and 2011.  I understand it did not increase much since 2008.  The same is the case with the quintile share of income.  We must make the issue part of the debate but we must acknowledge also when things improve or do not get worse.  The reality is that we will have a bigger tax take when all the changes have been implemented such as the property tax and water charges.  According to the OECD our tax system has become more progressive in recent years, which is a welcome development.<\/p><p>  There was an article in one of the British Sunday newspapers by Frank Field, a Labour MP.  I have seen the issue raised by other Labour MPs as well.  The article related to what social welfare has become in the United Kingdom.  A similar issue arises in this country.  When Beveridge introduced the notion of the welfare state it was based on the fact that one contributed to a safety net and then one got something back in that one could take advantage of it when it was needed.  What Frank Field said in the article is that the system was to provide for need as opposed to what one contributed.  There is an element of the system that is becoming self-perpetuating.  It is very hard to get people on social welfare back to work for various reasons based on the way the system is designed.  Do the witnesses have a comment on how to make a better social welfare system that would go back to the original spirit of Beveridge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600008#J00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>What is the dynamic between the number of people who are currently homeless and on the streets and the reasons behind it?

That does require people leading a lifestyle which is conducive to that.  Are there other categories of people which also contribute to an increase in the number of homeless people?<\/p><p>  On introducing a system of rent supplement that would be more akin to the way rent is charged for council houses, could the witnesses develop the suggestion more and outline the proposed costs?

In some cases low-paid jobs are available but it can be difficult to make the jump from getting rent supplement to being in the workforce.

For a number of reasons with which we are all familiar fuel prices are likely to rise substantially.  While special schemes and support schemes are useful the best way to tackle fuel poverty is to increase the amount of money available to people generally rather than simply to subsidise the fuel itself.  It is also important to provide schemes to reduce fuel consumption which are much more broadly available.

The difference in the position between now and a number of years ago is partly to do with the number losing work, but it has much more to do with the fact that accommodation is not available to meet the extra demand.  Cutbacks in services have made it difficult.<\/p><p>  The habitual residence condition makes it very difficult for people who cannot prove they have been living in the country for three years, although it depends on the particular terms and conditions applying, to access either State-supported housing or housing provided by voluntary organisations funded by the State.  This means that many people who came here from abroad, worked and contributed to the social welfare and tax systems here are not eligible for housing.  It also means that people who emigrated from Ireland and have returned are not eligible for housing.  This has contributed seriously to the problem.<\/p><p>  While there are many reasons people become homeless - social, economic and mental health issues - we know what the solutions are.  The voluntary organisations which work with homeless persons and have learned from counterparts in other countries know what they are.  What they need is money and the investment to make it happen.<\/p><p>  In terms of restructuring the social housing system, the ideas put on the table which I understand have been presented to the committee by the homeless organisations in our membership are aimed at transforming the system from one based primarily on people receiving a supplement to pay for accommodation in the private rented sector which is often not adequate and means many landlords will not accept those in receipt of rent supplement towards one under which the council would rent housing according to people's means.  It would be a modernised version of the old council housing scheme but one which would be much more flexible and adapted to meet people's needs, housing availability and the requirements of the modern market.<\/p><p>  On the question of the housing that is appropriate, we have a concern.  We are happy that a number of schemes are being put together to use empty houses and transform some of the ghost estates which have gained prominence in the media into areas in which people on low incomes can live.  Part of the problem is that, unfortunately, many of these areas were designed as places where people could sleep and commute from rather than places in which they could live.  We will, therefore, need to put some thought into the housing that is most appropriate.<\/p><p>  All of this comes back to examining the policy areas mentioned in a national anti-poverty strategy and the need for poverty proofing.  We must ask about the impact on equality across society.  Specifically, what will be the impact on those who are suffering the most in terms of poverty of particular measures?  It is not enough to measure, count and write strategies.  We need to put serious amounts of money behind them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Hanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578700,"counter":35,"content":"<p>A question was asked about Food Bank infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600009#K00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362578700,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600009#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin Hanan"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Ginnell to be very brief because the Minister is waiting outside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600009#K00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362578700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I will make a number of points.

My commitment to fairness in society remains strong and is made very clear in the 2013 education budget.  The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has been protected for the 2013-14 school year.  For mainstream schools, this is the second year in a row that we have managed to protect the pupil-teacher ratios, despite the pressures on the education budget.  The pupil-teacher ratio has also been protected for free second level schools.  This will ensure a broad range of subject choices remains available to students in free schools.  Fee-charging schools will see their pupil-teacher ratios rise from 21:1 to 23:1 from next September.  An analysis of the funding of these schools has just been published and shows the surplus disposable income available to these 55 schools.<\/p><p>  The overall number of SNAs remains at 10,575 for the coming year.  This continues our record of protecting overall SNA numbers since entering office in 2011.  Resource teachers have also been protected.  In 2011 we increased the overall number of resource teachers from 9,600 to 9,950 and that number has been retained for 2013.  The DEIS scheme has been fully protected this year and there are no changes to the overall staffing or funding of disadvantaged schools.<\/p><p>  In total, this means that we expect to hire an additional 450 primary teachers and 450 second level teachers for the next school year, or 900 in all.  These numbers are expected to continue to rise in coming years to deal with rising enrolments.  Despite the economic position, the Government has shown its strong commitment to protecting and investing in education and creating employment for teachers.<\/p><p>  We are committed to ensuring every child leaves school with high levels of literacy and numeracy.  To ensure this, a further &euro;6.5 million will be made available in 2013 to continue rolling out the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  Some &euro;3 million will also be spent on the overhaul of the junior cycle programme in 2013, rising to &euro;8.7 million in 2014.  The schools building programme for 2013 will see work begin on 50 new schools and major extensions and work continue on 44 projects, at an overall cost of &euro;370 million.<\/p><p>  The rolling out of high-speed broadband to all second level schools is continuing.  Some 278 schools are now fully connected and a further 200 will be connected by next September.  All second level schools will receive high-speed broadband, at no cost to them, before September 2014.  The number for post-primary schools is 723.<\/p><p>  In addition to investing in education and ensuring changes to the education budget are managed in the fairest way possible, I am implementing an ambitious reform agenda to ensure better outcomes for all students.  The action plan published last year in response to the forum on patronage is being implemented.  This will ensure greater parental choice of school type and patronage in primary education, an option which is long overdue.  Some 90% of the 3,200 schools are under the patronage of the Catholic Church and 95%, in total, are under the patronage of Christian churches.<\/p><p>  The literacy and numeracy strategy is continuing to be rolled out to ensure all students are fully literate and numerate before they leave school.  To support this strategy, the time spent on literacy and maths was lengthened this year, standardised testing was extended to give us a better idea of improvements for each child and the reporting of information to parents was improved.  In 2013, &euro;6.5 million will be spent on continuing to drive this strategy.<\/p><p>  A complete overhaul of the junior cycle programme is under way.  The current system sees many students switching off from learning in second year at post-primary level and the formal examinations at the end of third year make that worse.  The reformed junior cycle programme will begin in September 2014 and place emphasis on school-based assessment rather than rote learning for a national examination that is simply seen as a dry run for the leaving certificate examination.  In 2013 we will spend &euro;3 million in resourcing the new junior cycle programme, rising to &euro;8.7 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  Legislation will be introduced later in 2013 to ensure school enrolments in primary and second level schools are managed in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.  We have announced for the first time ever a transparent five-year building programme, providing certainty for parents, teachers and schools about their future.  Our planned investment is &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p><p>  The 33 VECs are being consolidated to create 16 local education and training boards.  I thank members for their co-operation when the legislation passed through the D&aacute;il.  The new bodies will take over the management of the existing F&Aacute;S training centres and deliver the training and apprenticeship courses that industry and wider society need.  The legislation is due to go before the Seanad shortly.  F&Aacute;S is being replaced by SOLAS, a new body that can properly control the operation and funding of a co-ordinated further education and training sector.  The legislation has just passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and I hope it will be up and running later this year.<\/p><p>  The number of publicly funded colleges that train teachers is being reduced from 19 to six to ensure the best quality training for teachers.  Work is also under way to implement the new strategy for higher education.<\/p><p>  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600010#L00500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1362579300,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600010#L00600","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362579900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>While Deputy McConalogue has covered most points, I will raise one or two more.  The minor works grant has been put to one side because of financial pressures, which, as I have stated previously, is an extremely short-sighted measure because schools that use this type of grant to maintain their properties will fall into greater disrepair and it will cost more in the long run.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision.  Alternatively, he might provide members with analysis on whether a study was conducted as to how it will affect particular schools.<\/p><p>  Everyone recognises that in common with all other Departments, the education sector is under significant pressure.  It is not always about where one can save money or can implement cuts as one also should give consideration to the different ways in which education is delivered.  I am sure the Department could and should be considering a number of cost-neutral measures and perhaps a discussion is required on some such measures that could be implemented and which would improve the manner in which the education system is delivered.  I acknowledge the Minister is so doing in the context of the legislation members have just been discussing regarding the further education sector.  This demonstrates how it is possible to bring forward positive reforming measures, which will have a highly positive impact and which will save money in the long term, without affecting front-line services.  Perhaps a wider discussion is required on such measures at both primary and post-primary level.  Is the Department considering other cost-neutral measures at present?<\/p><p>  One major issue affecting the teaching profession at present is that of newly qualified teachers and the difficulties they face in trying to secure full-time employment.  The Minister might be able to provide some thoughts and ideas on how the Department plans to address the casualisation taking place within the teaching profession.  On the question of student grants, a number of areas must be considered.  While a reduction of 3% in grants is being contemplated, one reason the Department put forward was that income levels need to be considered.  Income levels have fallen by approximately 8% and it must be seen in that context.  While this may be the case, expenditure from those incomes also has increased.  As people are paying more indirect taxation and property taxes are being introduced, families' actual disposable income also is decreasing and this matter must be considered.  I am interested in the subject of capital assets in respect of grants and when that policy will be produced because it will have a significant effect on a large number of people who are trying to access the education system.  As for the issue of fee-paying schools, members had sight of the report yesterday and I wonder what is the next move in this regard.  I am sure it will feed into the budget measures that will be announced for next year but I would appreciate the Minister's thoughts in this regard.<\/p> <p>It was clear from that report that fee-paying schools can absorb a change in the pupil-teacher ratio.  According to the figure in the report, if the pupil-teacher ratio was increased to 28:1, they could even absorb that.  It is currently 23:1, so there is scope there.  I know the Minister cannot do it in one fell swoop but is the Minister examining that matter in terms of trying to save money?  If we are saving money there we need to invest it in education in disadvantaged communities.  That is what needs to happen and no one could argue against such a policy.  I wonder what the Minister's own thoughts are on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600011#M00200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Does Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in want to come in now or will he wait?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600012#N00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I am in between two committee meetings - this one and the Select Sub-Committee on Finance, which is dealing with the Finance Bill.

As regards fee-paying schools, our committee is looking at the Finnish education system.  By law, schools in Finland - including private schools - cannot charge fees.  That is an interesting system.

I thank the Minister for attending the committee and I apologise for being late.  Four of us were over in Finland last week.  It was fascinating to see the difference between what we have - which is effectively a State-funded system - and what they have, which is a State system.  In Finland, all children in a particular school district attend the one school.  It was interesting to see that children there do not start school until seven years of age.  They stay in the one continuum of education from seven to 16, so that the traumatic transfer to second level does not necessarily take place.  It was also interesting to hear some of the buzz-words they were using, such as \"trust\".  Teachers are trusted because they have a high standard of education themselves and all have masters degrees.  There is not a big inspection regime and there only seems to be one state exam at the age of 19.<\/p><p>  I deliberately asked what they would think of a system which had girls and boys being taught in separate schools, and all wearing school uniforms.  I got the predictable response of puzzled faces looking at each other and asking, \"Where is this place that you speak of?\"  It was Ireland, of course.<\/p><p>  We had a meeting with the Finnish Parliament's education and culture committee.  A conservative MP told us we had to understand that the most important thing about the Finnish education system was equality.  While Finland is an interesting dynamic, we need to address a few things in the Irish education system.  Deputy O'Brien rightly referred to back-to-school costs, including school books.  As regards the relationship between the State, the Department and patrons, at what stage can we encourage patron bodies to have a more active role in running individual schools and in policies?<\/p><p>  We have a problem with an over-supply of primary teachers.  The new Hibernia College is churning out a huge number of highly qualified teachers but there are no jobs for them.  There seems to be no level of regulation, so does the Minister have a comment to make about it?  It is unfair to have a system that produces so many teachers when there will never be enough jobs for them, regardless of budgetary measures that change from year to year.<\/p><p>  There is a huge volume of work involved, given the list of reforms that are taking place.  The junior cycle is a great reform and the focus on literacy is very important.<\/p><p>  The issue of fee-paying schools is quite current and the report has only just been released.  The Minister may not wish to comment on it but the report has debunked the simplistic argument that if expenditure on subventing teachers in those schools was withdrawn it would save us &euro;90 million.  The Minister has been increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in those schools over a period of years.  I suggest that such a progression over the years would ease the reliance of those schools on the State, but there will come a tipping point for many schools which may find themselves going into the State system.<\/p><p>  We have to talk about teacher morale.  I visit schools regularly and talk to principals and teachers there.  For whatever reason, they feel as if the political system, the media or society in general does not appreciate them, does not feel they do a good job or feels they are not worth the money or holidays they receive.   That is a complete contrast to what we discovered in Finland.  Perhaps Irish teachers have always felt this way but particularly in recent years - I do not think it is particular to this Government or the previous one - they have felt undervalued by society.  It is difficult to drive reforms if people are not coming on board and are not empowered by the process.<\/p><p>  At what stage can we have a quantifiable status as to how successful, or otherwise, the national literacy strategy has been?  These strategies are put in place - often with the best will in the world and for justifiable reasons - with major research behind them but we need to be sure we are doing the right thing.  Is there a strategy in place to take account of what is being done and achieved, and whether we are going the right way about it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600012#N00700","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify that in Finland the private schools are State-funded, like here, but they are not allowed to charge fees.

It would be the year after, because there would be issues such as implementation and getting the information.  That is assuming we reach a decision fairly quickly.<\/p><p>  The issue of fee-paying schools was the other one mentioned by most members.  Last year, we raised the pupil-teacher ratio for fee-paying schools - 55 of them - from 21:1 to 23:1.  There was some concern about where all of this is going, what was my agenda, if I had an agenda, and how far we would go.  As the committee will be aware, an bord snip nua, Colm McCarthy's body, had recommended that it be increased as far as 28:1.<\/p><p>  We had very little information.  The schools themselves published a conclusion from a PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report which stated that having fee-paying schools was to the State's advantage because it costs the State less to have a student in a fee-paying school, but they have never published the full report.  We undertook to do an analysis, not an audit, of fee-paying schools.  The methodology used was to ascertain the fee being charged by each of the schools, which is in the public domain, and to do a simple multiplication based on the school numbers, which we knew.  Mr. Martin Hanevy, an assistant secretary in Athlone, was driving the project.  The Department contacted all of the schools stating the Department's calculation of their gross income and asking them to confirm such was the case and whether it was their effective income.  They responded in various ways, most of them looking for a confidentiality clause, into which we entered.  We were then told that they have a certain number of students who are being carried on reduced fees - in some cases, the families are not paying the fees because they are no longer in a position to pay them - or they have obligations with regard to mortgages on school buildings and other ancillary costs.  Therefore, we got a net figure.  All of this is in the report that was published yesterday.  Deputy O'Brien probably has not had a chance to go through it.<\/p><p>  In order to respect the request for anonymity from the schools and also to make no distinction between Catholic, Protestant and other denominations, we grouped them under two categories: volume of income, based on the scale of the fee, and size of the school, based on enrolment.  There are a number of calculations that come out of that.  They are in broad bands - approximately, from memory, five or seven bands and clusters.  The total amount of discretionary income available, after their liabilities and obligations were discharged, for the 55 schools was &euro;81.6 million, but that ranges from a couple of thousand euro in some cases to a significant amount in others.  That is what the report tells us.  As to what we will do next, no decision has been made.<\/p><p>  Since this process started, Kilkenny College in Kilkenny city has decided to come into the free voluntary system.  The committee can speak to the school as it wishes, but one of the factors that influenced the school was that, like a number of provincial schools, it had boarders, day-boarders and day students.  Wilson's Hospital School in Multyfarnham was the first to construct an arrangement whereby its boarders were separately accounted for.  It is a Protestant school, and Protestant families who qualify for income support - which was put in place when the free voluntary scheme was brought into existence in 1966-1967 - could be subsidised there.  The day-boarders are students who travel a fair distance and who, when they arrive in the morning, might get a top-up breakfast and who certainly get lunch, tea and supervised study.  Rockwell College and others run similar schemes.  The components outside the classroom that are covered by the current free scheme can be charged by the school.  In addition to the accounts for the residential pupils, there was what I will call a day-boarding account, where there was a fee for all-in provision of services outside the classroom.  At Wilson's Hospital, the classroom subjects themselves and the teacher allocation come under the umbrella of a free voluntary school.  That model - there is a transitional arrangement within it that has been constructed by the school section in Athlone - was developed in consultation with Wilson's Hospital over a couple of years.  It is that model that Kilkenny College examined and decided made sense for it.  It made sense for two reasons.  First and foremost, from a resource point of view, the capitation that the school would get and the pupil-teacher ratio that it would get, as distinct from what it got under the fee-paying scheme, were more attractive.  From the point of view of ethos, it made a great deal of sense.  Anecdotally, I encountered this at a function at Alexandra College in south Dublin, which is a Church of Ireland girls' school, where a number of parents from Kilkenny said to me that many of the Protestant families in the area - I refer to rural south Leinster and north Munster - simply could not afford the fees of Kilkenny College but wanted, for all the reasons to which any person is entitled, to have their children educated in a school of their ethos.  That was a factor in the decision by Kilkenny College.<\/p><p>  I should say that there are approximately four other schools, both Catholic and Protestant - not all of which are boarding schools - now talking to the Department.  I cannot tell the committee their names they are because they have sought confidentiality.  In 1966, a couple of Catholic schools chose not to come into the free voluntary system because they had recently been established and had a building programme - in effect, a mortgage - and the free scheme did not accommodate the commitments on that mortgage.  There may be other schools that choose to come in.  One of my concerns was the perception in Northern Ireland that somehow or other the Government was attacking Protestant schools, and it was seen as discriminatory.  It is not discriminatory.  That is the position.<\/p><p>  On another similar matter, Deputy O'Brien and the Chairman inquired about the possibility of a minor works grant scheme of some kind or other.  I am talking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, about the possibility, if some stimulus funding becomes available in whatever shape or form, of bringing it into the schools programme.  There are some choices available to us.  First, there is no promise of any funding.  There is an expectation that there might be some, but we will not know until later.  If it becomes available, there is the question of what will go into the schools physical capital programme of infrastructure.  There is the summer minor works grant or, possibly, the continuation or acceleration of the process of getting rid of prefabs.  In many cases, we are paying rent for prefabs.  The attraction for me - and for the management bodies within schools, particularly the principals - is that in bad weather it is a nightmare moving from a stand-alone prefab into the main framework of a school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600013#O00300","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362581700,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Is there a timeframe on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600014#P00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1362581700,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We have asked them to come back to us as soon as possible.

The youth crisis in our society that has resulted in tragedies like suicide contains some elements related to the school environment and others from outside our schools.  I refer the Deputy to a substantial survey carried out by the National Council for Guidance in Education, the director of which is Jennifer McKenzie.  The conclusions of that survey are less dramatic than the one undertaken by the Institute of Guidance Counsellors.  We have published two reports, one with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on mental health and well-being in the school environment and the other on the action plan on bullying.<\/p><p>  Controversy has arisen over the statement by the Minister of State, which I support, on reinforcing a whole school engagement in the welfare and guidance of young people.  Counselling and career guidance are two separate issues and when I speak about guidance counsellors I am referring to the pastoral care dimension.  If this is everybody's concern, it is also everybody's responsibility.  The health document that the Minister of State produced with major input from a number of specialists in this area states that a young person who is troubled should in the first instance be able to talk to an adult with whom he or she feels comfortable, whoever that adult may be.  It may be the English teacher, the sports coach or the caretaker.  Given the way in which the approach is being driven in the policy document, that adult will already have been sensitised in a school briefing which advises all adults working in the school to keep their eyes and ears open for signs of distress.  The first responsibility of whoever this young person approaches is to refer him or her to the guidance counsellor and, in turn, if the counsellor believes the issues arising are much bigger than he or she is professionally equipped to address, the young person will be referred onwards.  It is a three-stage approach.  By mainstreaming the issue, responsibility for the well-being of students is placed on the entire community, including the mates of the young person in question, as distinct from the old perception that it was exclusively the responsibility of guidance counsellors.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that we have made a reduction in the allocation of resources.  I am not dressing the issue up as anything other than a reduction of resources.  In the first instance we have given responsibility and choice to the school principal to deploy the reduced allocation as best he or she can.  Some principals have welcomed that change, whereas others have been silent and, of course, the guidance counsellors are unhappy about it.  I do not think we can come to a conclusion as to whether our decision has reduced safety for young people in our schools but it was informed by the principle of reducing the impact on front-line services.  The alternative was to reduce pupil-teacher ratios across the post-primary school sector.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked whether the proportions of special needs assistants and resource teachers are decreasing in the context of population growth.  The population is growing at a faster rate than the incidence of requirements for SNAs and resource teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600014#P00500","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362582300,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Is there anything the Minister can do proactively to ensure that happens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013030600015#Q00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1362582300,"counter":68,"content":"<p>We have, for example, produced guidelines and ways to put in place a book lending and library scheme, showed how it can be done and invited schools to do it.

Some of the disadvantaged schools in Darndale have highlighted that they have children with serious behavioural problems who were supposed to be given appointments with behavioural psychologists.  However, the parents do not bring them and then the school has a problem getting access to other resources because it cannot get the report confirming that the child has a problem.  Given that many children from the school are attending that service two miles away, it would make much more sense if the health service staff, who are sitting waiting for the children to turn up, actually delivered it for a few hours a week at the school.

The universal social charge has imposed a devastating burden of reduced income on low and middle income earners in a way that has not only put many of the people concerned in a perilous financial state, adding to the difficulties of paying mortgages and bills, but has also had a devastating effect on their spending power and, consequently, the domestic economy.  The first amendment is aimed at trying to relieve the burden of the universal social charge on those on low and middle incomes, that is, those earning less than &euro;65,000 a year.  The second suggests the new rate for pensioners should only apply to pensioners earning in excess of &euro;65,000.<\/p><p>  I wish to make one point to which the Minister and the Government have never really responded.  At some level, they would accept that income cuts for low and middle income earners have dampened or damaged the domestic economy, but they see it as a necessary evil and suggest there is no real alternative.  What I am trying to point to is that, if we shift the burden to higher earners, it will, first, provide great relief for those who are suffering and simply cannot afford these cuts in their income, and, second, impose higher taxes on those who can afford them and, therefore, not do as much damage to the economy.<\/p><p>  When people have higher earnings, they have money they can save.  As we know, savings in the State have actually increased and, as they are clearly not being made by low and middle income earners, have been accumulated by higher earners who do not need the money to survive and put it in the bank.  If what we are trying to do is release funds back into the economy, it is far more logical to tax those on higher incomes than it is to tax those on low and middle incomes.  I doubt very much the Minister is going to accept my amendments, but I would interested to hear his response to my argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600003#B00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362564000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I propose to take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced in my Budget Statement that individuals earning more than &euro;60,000 would not be entitled to benefit from the lower rates of the universal social charge.

In addition, individuals aged 70 years and over with incomes exceeding &euro;65,000 would only pay at a maximum rate of universal social charge of 4% on their incomes.  In the case of an individual aged under 70 years and earning &euro;64,500, there would be no liability for the universal social charge, whereas an individual earning &euro;65,001 would have a liability of &euro;3,868.87.  The cost to the Exchequer of the amendments would be very high, having been estimated by the Revenue Commissioners at &euro;2.4 billion, and they would benefit approximately 1.5 million taxpayers.

We said it would cost &euro;2.5 billion which is slightly higher than what the Minister is suggesting, although I thank him for the confirmation.  However, we also pointed out that by putting extra taxes in whatever form - the universal social charge in this instance which gives me the opportunity to make this point - onto those earning in excess of &euro;65,000 it would bring in the same amount of &euro;2.5 billion.  Ideally, as we proposed in our pre-budget submission, this would happen through the income tax system by increasing the effective tax rates on a sliding scale.  The effective rates currently run from approximately 31% for those on &euro;100,000 a year up to approximately 42% or 43% for persons earning &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million a year.  Therefore, if we were to increase the 31% rate to 33% or 34% and the 60% rate for those earning millions every year, we could capture the &euro;2.5 billion.  This would be to the advantage of low and middle income earners who have been hammered by the universal social charge and it would also put billions of euro back into the economy, stimulating growth in the domestic economy, creating high street demand and boosting the small and medium enterprise sector which is on the floor.  That would boost economic growth, whereas imposing the same tax burden on those on higher earnings, while I am sure they would not like it, would not have the same damaging effect on the domestic economy as the policies pursued by the last Government which are being persisted with by the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister says the cost would be great.  I put it to him that taxing low and middle income earners in the way he is doing and leaving them in a position where they have virtually no disposable income is the key factor in crippling the domestic economy.  This measure is directed at trying to relieve the pressure and transferring the burden onto those who could afford it.  As we know from the figures for savings, such individuals are saving their money, not spending it; therefore, they could afford to carry a significant additional tax burden.  I do not know why the Minister does not acknowledge this fact.  Whenever we talk about increased taxes on higher earners, he talks about taxes on jobs.  I put it to him that the universal social charge in the way it is being levied is a tax on jobs.  It is the key tax that is preventing the domestic economy from recovering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600003#B00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362564000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The universal social charge is a tax which was in place before the Government took office.

Otherwise it will be dismissed and nobody will take anything on board.  Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Michael McGrath have tabled amendments I do not support and I am sure they do not support some of mine but it is fair to say the amendments have been tabled in good faith.  They are based on evidence, some of them on parliamentary questions.  For example, the idea of a third rate of tax is something that could actually happen, similar to the amendment Deputy McGrath tabled in regard to a universal social charge of 10%.  This is not \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\"; it can happen.  The decision rests on the impacts caused, and it is on that we should base our discussion.  It is not that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow but of course the Government could introduce a third rate of tax, at 48%.  If such a rate was introduced it would make the tax system even more progressive.  There have been reports that the Irish tax system is progressive but it would be more so if there was an additional band, which would bring in &euro;365 million, based on the Minister's figures.  These are not guesstimates or crystal ball gazings but the word of Department of Finance officials.  They include parliamentary questions the Minister has signed off on and put before the Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the figures that would accrue from a third rate of tax.  The real question is not whether there is a pot of gold; a third rate of tax at 48% would bring in &euro;365 million.  If we were to follow that type of proposal, as argued by Sinn F&eacute;in and others and giving different variants such as including the universal social charge, the real question is what would be the impact on society, on jobs, on the economy and on fairness, and whose burden we would be able to relieve by targeting those whose incomes are above &euro;100,000, instead of targeting the &euro;365 million from those who are on lower incomes.<\/p><p>  I say that at the start of this discussion because we should have a genuine intellectual debate on the policy options available to us.  All of us come from different parts of the spectrum of political opinion.  Some people believe it is fair to ask those who have more disposable income to pay more tax, in spite of the fact there is a high rate of marginal tax in this State.  We accept that, do not dispute the Minister's statement about the high rate of marginal tax but we have to deal with the effective rate of tax.  We know that the richest in Irish society pay a huge portion of tax; it is because they are richest and have the income.  The poorest do not pay because they do not have the income.  We are faced with choices.  Everybody at this committee believes we need to reduce our deficit - that can be put to one side.  We all want to reduce the deficit and get to the 3% figure, perhaps not within the same timeframe, but we all want to get there.  The question then is options.  We should have a genuine discussion, asking what would be the real impact of a 48% tax rate for those earning over &euro;100,000.  There would be an impact; we are not naive enough to think otherwise.  Of course people earning more than &euro;100,000, who were asked to pay seven cent on every &euro;1 they earn over that figure, would be pissed off.  Other people might decide not to come here, or whatever.  We must also weigh that impact against the beneficial impact there would be in taking &euro;365 million away from another taxation measure that would hurt people. <\/p><p>  I refer, for example, to the property tax of this year-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600004#C00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362564600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Deputy is drifting away.

There seems to be general agreement, for the reasons I described already, that people do not oppose this particular increase in the universal social charge for people who had an unjustified exemption previously.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputies who have said that we need to take all parts of the story together, because the different decisions taken collectively have an impact.  Let us consider, for example, people who are currently on a salary of &euro;100,000.  If we look at their net pay after all the deductions, they are not extraordinarily  wealthy people.  They are people who are coping and some of them are finding it hard to cope.  A view seems to have emerged in Opposition that the threshold between poverty and wealth is &euro;100,000 and that someone earning above &euro;100,000 can withstand any kind of charge.  It seems to be open season on anyone earning above &euro;100,000.<\/p><p>  With regard to taking all the parts of Government policy together, according to the latest Croke Park agreement, public servants earning in excess of &euro;100,000 will suffer a pay cut of 8%.  We decided at budget time that we would seek a new Croke Park agreement and we knew, generally, the direction the policy should take.  If we had increased the universal social charge by 3%, it would have applied to all those people as well.  Therefore, as well as an 8% cut, they would suffer a double hit from the budget.  As Deputy McGrath says, we must watch all the moving parts together so that we do not have too onerous an effect on any one set of people or have an unforeseen impact on the economy, costing economic growth and jobs.  That is our position.  My only criticism of Deputy Boyd Barrett's approach is that it is not reasonable in a debate such as this, in which we are teasing out a Finance Bill section by section, to propose measures which have a massive effect on revenue, in this case to the tune of &euro;2.3 billion, and at the same time not to indicate specifically where that yield is to be recovered across the income levels or what impact that would have.<\/p><p>  I will try to address other specific questions now.  With regard to why the self-employed pay a higher rate of USC, when the USC was first introduced it had the effect of reducing the top marginal tax rates for both PAYE and self-employed income earners by 4%.  This would have meant that the high income earners would have gained from the measures introduced in budget 2011.  In the case of PAYE income earners, this potential gain was offset by the abolition of the PRSI ceiling and the restoration of a PAYE marginal tax of 52%.  However, in the case of the self-employed, for whom there was no PRSI ceiling, the marginal tax rate remained reduced.  To avoid a situation whereby a self-employed income earner earning in excess of &euro;200,000 would make a gain from income tax measures introduced in budget 2011, a higher rate of USC of 10% for income in excess of &euro;100,000 for the self-employed was introduced in the Finance Act 2011.  They are the historic reasons and the justification for that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked whether I have considered dealing with the anomaly caused by the &euro;60,000 threshold, whereby a person who is over 70 years and has an income of &euro;60,001 is subject to the standard rate of USC, while an individual earning &euro;1 less pays a reduced rate.  In order to ensure equity between all citizens, based on their level of income, the reduced rate of universal social charge will be discontinued from 1 January 2013 and the standard rate of USC will apply to the following two groups: those aged 70 years and over with incomes of &euro;60,000 and above; and medical card holders with incomes of &euro;60,000 and above.  Although the introduction of a step effect is never ideal, it is necessary to achieve the desired yield.  Similar step effects can also be seen for the threshold at which the 2% rate of USC applies and in the calculation of PRSI liabilities.  I have no plans to review this decision.  I would also point out that the additional liability for USC in 2013 for an individual aged 70 years or more or a medical card holder with an income of &euro;60,001 or over will be approximately &euro;1,320 per annum, which equates to approximately &euro;25 per week.  In addition, it is important to point out that payments from the Department of Social Protection, such as the State pension, are exempt from USC.  Furthermore, such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold.  Social welfare payments are exempt.  Therefore, what we are looking at are people whose pensions are entirely private or people with a combined social welfare and private pension in which the private part exceeds &euro;60,000.  That is fair in the circumstances.  The relief was not based on strong policy grounds historically, so this is a reasonable approach to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600007#F00900","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362567000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I raised the issue of the impact of the &euro;60,000 cut-off point.  I accept that these issues can arise when a change of rate beyond a certain level of income is being imposed.  As a result of this change, a person earning just over &euro;60,000 will pay an additional universal social charge of approximately &euro;1,300, which is quite severe, while a person on &euro;100 less - whose earnings are just under &euro;60,000 - will not be affected in the same way.  When a similar issue arose during the recent Croke Park negotiations - it was pointed out that the effect of a proposal relating to people earning slightly more than &euro;65,000 would not be similar to its effect on people earning &euro;64,500 - a proviso was included to ensure the deal would not result in the earnings of those who were on just over &euro;65,000 coming down below &euro;65,000.  Can the Minister devise an equivalent intervention from a taxation perspective to even out the effect of this measure?  It will be quite a severe hit for those who are just on the button.

The proposed new subsection (<i>b<\/i>)(2) states: &quot;Notwithstanding subsection (1) and the Table to this section, where an individual has relevant income that exceeds &euro;100,000, the individual shall, instead of being charged to universal social charge on the amount of the excess at the rate provided for in column (2) of that Table, be charged on the amount of that excess at the rate of 10 per cent&quot;.

There are two things I cannot let pass.  I do not know whether the Minister has the list of committee amendments in front of him.  It shows clearly that I submitted amendments to seek to get the money from elsewhere.  They were ruled out of order.  The particular method employed essentially provides for a sliding scale.  It is not about hammering people as soon as they get over the &euro;100,000 threshold.  It is about doing it on a sliding scale.  I am looking for the incremental increases to be organised on a sharper basis than is currently the case.  We do not have a third band.  I am proposing that the universal social charge be organised on the basis of a sliding scale of several bands.  This approach would probably be more effective in the case of income tax.  I am proposing it in the case of the universal social charge because that is what we are dealing with in this section.  Under my proposal, a person on &euro;150,000 would pay 12%, rather than 10% as proposed by the Minister, a person on &euro;200,000 would pay 17%, and so on and so forth.  It goes up to the extent that a person on over &euro;350,000 would pay 20%.  We could keep it going by tweaking and calibrating it until we get the &euro;2.4 billion.  The Minister could provide for this.  The money is there.  It would be a sharp increase, but it would not be a question of slaughtering people as soon as they exceed the &euro;100,000 threshold.  I think the Minister should be accurate in his responses to the alternatives that are being proposed.<\/p><p>  I would like to make another point to the Minister in this regard.  Figures can become somewhat meaningless at a certain level, particularly for those of us who spend a great deal of time looking at tables.  The Minister probably does this as well.  In the real world, there is a big difference between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000.  It is massive.  The Minister is absolutely right to say that someone who is on &euro;101,000 a year could face quite a tough situation if they have four kids and only one person in the house is working.  The circumstances of someone on &euro;120,000 are quite different.  The additional &euro;20,000 is another person's annual wage.  That is what people at the lower end are getting paid for an entire year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600008#G01300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362567000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The effective rate of tax-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600008#G01400","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1362567000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Excuse me.

Any person who has been self-employed with self-employed income exceeding &euro;100,000 will pay at a rate of 10% on the excess amount over &euro;100,000.  A pensioner in receipt of a pension is taxed under PAYE and the rate of USC will be a maximum of 7%.  In cases of combined incomes, for example, a pension from PAYE income and income from self employment, differentiation will be made and they will be treated separately.  The rate of 10% will be applied to the self-employed income.  The key to the Deputy's query is that, for the purpose of 128(2), relevant income shall not include any amount in respect of which an individual is chargeable to tax under Schedule E in accordance in with section 128(2).  It is a distinction between how one is taxed as a PAYE worker or as a self-employed worker.  That is included in the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600009#H00100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362567600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<blockquote><br \/>In page 11, before section 5, to insert the following new section:&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister shall within 3 months of the passing of this Act prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann an analysis of the tax increases in this Act, and the total of tax increases and spending cuts of Budget 2013, setting out the continuing impact on people based on their gender, income, age, marital and disability status.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>We had a discussion earlier about the Minister citing the Commission report and Opposition Deputies citing the ESRI report.  At the end of the day, neither makes an in-depth analysis of the impact of budgetary matters on different sections of society.  The amendment calls for an evidence-based approach in respect of what the Government does at budget time.  It calls for the Minister, within three months of the passing of the Act, to prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il an analysis of the tax increases in the Act, and the total of tax increases and spending cuts of budget 2013, setting out the continuing impact on people based on their gender, income, age, marital and disability status.  It calls for equality proofing of the legislation and it should be done prior to a budget.  The budget should be independently proofed before enactment.  Just up the road, in Stormont, that takes place under section 75 of the Equality Act, where Departments are required to independently scrutinise proposals and ensure they do not adversely affect one section of society or another.  There is much talk about fairness and it is a word that has been bandied about by the Government.  The budget is not fair and it hurts people on low and middle incomes.  It has not dealt with the issue of excess, whether with regard to high-income earners under the Croke Park agreement or asking those with high incomes in the private sector to pay more.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned salaries of &euro;100,000 per year and how such people are finding it difficult to get by.  That may be the case but if one subscribes to that view, people on &euro;20,000 are finding it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get by.  This Minister must realise that reality.<\/p><p>  A third rate of tax at 48% would guarantee the income of every individual up to &euro;100,000.  Anyone earning &euro;100,000 would not be affected by the proposal.  It would apply only to the income in excess of &euro;100,000, on which they pay 7 cent on every euro.  Incomes up to that level would be protected, which is generous.  The amendment refers to income assessment, proper equality impact assessment and examining groups such as people with disadvantage and women.  If the Minister does such analysis, he will see his budgets have negatively affected categories such as women and those with disabilities.  This should not cost any money or only a small amount of money.  It is important and it is the way we should do this analysis.  No one should fear facts and figures and we should not rely on the European Commission or the ESRI to tell us whether the budget is progressive.  I made this proposal before and I hope the Minister is open to it.  I am not sure if Fine Gael supports the idea but, in opposition, the Labour Party argued for equality proofing of budgetary matters.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was one of the advocates at the time, along with Sinn F&eacute;in.  There is a campaign to have budgets equality proofed and it would be a mature reflection on the Parliament if we were open enough to say that these are the decisions and to measure the impact on the disabled sector, the low income sector, women and other groups in society.  The template exists and it can be replicated in the State.  Hopefully, some of the independently equality proofed analyses will show budgets in the future have improved the lot of these sections of society.  It is equally important to provide hard facts and to lay them before the House for its perusal.<\/p><p>  Such a measure would also allow Members in opposition or Government Deputies to make better informed decisions.  There is no resolution to the debate on whether last year's budget was progressive.  We contend it is not, the Minister contends it is.  We are just going around the houses and we will not get anywhere.  If there was proper equality proofing of the budget, we could say that we had done the evidence-based analysis and that the budget has, for example, benefited women, marginally decreased the welfare of the disabled and worked out in a particular way for higher earners.  The Government should not be afraid of this although I can understand why the Government may be afraid of it at this point.  If such equality impact assessment was done on the budget, it would be embarrassing for the Minister, for his party in government and for his coalition partners.  I commend the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600009#H00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362567600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I have no embarrassment about my budgets, which have been crucial to the economic recovery that is now quite evident.

The main reason is the underlying principle of proportionality in cost benefit analysis.  The level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate with the scale of expenditure involved.  One of the measures in the Bill, the scheme of tax relief for investment in film, has already been subject to a full public consultation, to take the views of all interested parties, as well as the publication of economic models and substantial data and analysis.  This was a transparent and comprehensive process, in line with best international practice for policy evaluation.

The Minister might take issue with what it includes or does not include or the methodology it uses, but the point is that the work is already being done.  The thrust of the amendment seeks to have an analysis carried out of the impact of the budget on individuals.  The examples given by the Minister are right and proper.  They are assessments of the effectiveness of tax reliefs, for example, in different sectors.

However, I will put that to one side.  The issue has to do with equality proofing which is done in other jurisdictions; therefore, there is a template available.  I do not want the Department to spend hundreds of thousands of euro on cost-benefit analyses or equality impact assessments, but there is a template there that can be used.  It can follow best practice.  It is important to spell out how budgets affect different sections of society.<\/p><p>  We talk about facts and figures, deficit reduction and GDP growth, yet there is not enough of a focus on the individuals affected.  They are not just digits on a computer screen.  They are genuine people, some of whom are impacted on more favourably than others.  This type of analysis would enable us to spell out clearly whether there was a basket of proposals that on their own were worthy of inclusion in a budget and, when combined, would have an adverse impact on, for example, women or the disabled or those on low incomes.  <\/p><p>  I appreciate and welcome what the Minister is saying in terms of a cost-benefit analysis.  Last night we passed Second Stage of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013.  I have not seen any publication analysing how that tax will impact on the 180,000 in mortgage distress, even though it is the largest taxation measure the Minister has introduced this year.  He said in parliamentary replies that he had taken this on board.  I would love to see his documentation on how the people concerned are expected to pay property tax, given that they have not been able to pay their bank for the past 90 or 180 days, or even the past year.  I would love to see the Minister's assessment.  That is different from this issue which is about equality proofing which is done in other jurisdictions.  If the Northern Ireland Assembly can do it, there is no reason we cannot do it.  The Assembly introduced it because of discrimination as a result of one-party rule in the North.  It provided for equality proofing in the legislation stemming from the Good Friday Agreement.  All Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers send their departmental estimates for independent equality proofing and all Departments in the Northern Ireland Executive must comply with section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  It is completely different from what we have here.  The Executive publishes its legislative proposals which are then sent for independent assessment and if they are okay, they will be passed.  We need to be more mature when it comes to budgetary decisions.  I know the European Union is forcing us to move in that direction, but this would help us in that regard.  <\/p><p>  I agree with the Minister on undertaking a cost-benefit analysis of every single line or measure included in the Bill, but that is not what this is about.  It is about having a State document stating this is how the budget will impact on individuals.  The stuff included at the back of the budget book is helpful, but it does not take into account all of the budgetary measures.  It makes a good stab at dealing with some of them, but it does not take into account all of the other measures contained in the budget.  One should have a basket of indicators; look at gender and those on low incomes, as well as other equality indicators such as disadvantage and disability.  One should look at how the overall budget impacts on these sectors and then publish a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600010#J01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362568200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>There is a concept in politics and public administration which is generally summed up as the paralysis of analysis.

This is not about cost benefit analysis.  The cost benefit analysis carried out heretofore relates to whether it would be beneficial to the economy to do X, Y or Z.  I refer, for example to whether it would be beneficial to cut off legacy property tax reliefs, reduce the rate of VAT and so forth.  What we are seeking is equality proofing.  The Minister referred to the ESRI but earlier he disputed certain findings made by that organisation.  We are seeking that the Department should carry out an analysis of how the budget affects different categories.  In other words, it should consider how budget 2013 affects women or those with disabilities.  If we were to consider how the disabled have been affected, we could review what has been the impact on them of the measures relating to health, social protection and finance.  The impact in respect of low-income thresholds and those whose mortgages are distressed could also be analysed.<\/p><p>  A basket of indicators could be used in the context of the analysis to which I refer.  I am not prescribing what should be those indicators or the groups which should be analysed.  I am merely providing examples of the types of groups in respect of which analyses should be carried out.  I am not stating that the position of every Mary and Sean should be analysed.  Rather, I am of the view that the impact on particular groups which we all genuinely believe should be protected or which at least should not be adversely or unfairly affected by budgetary decisions should be analysed.  I accept that all citizens may be obliged to tighten their belts but I would like an analysis to be carried out in respect of the groups of individuals to which I refer in order that it can be clearly shown that, for example, this year's budget did not adversely affect the disability sector.  The analysis might actually show that the disability sector has benefited from the budget.  It might also show that women have benefited or have lost out.  That is what we are seeking, we are not concerned here with the economic impact.<\/p><p>  As the Minister well knows, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council will analyse budget 2013 in respect of its affect on the economy and its potential to reach the deficit reduction targets.  The council will not consider the impact of the budget on, for example, the disability sector.  Both the Minister and I know this and there is no point in pretending the council is going to do something different.<\/p><p>  I referred to the North, which is not the only jurisdiction in which equality proofing is carried out.  Equality proofing should be something of which we have no fear.  I accept, from what he said, that the Minister is not going to accept the amendment.  Without spending any money at all, will he not ask his officials to examine what has happened in other jurisdictions where equality proofing has been introduced?  Will he ask them to discover what would be the impact and cost of introducing equality proofing here?  Will he and his officials consider the concept - without making any commitment whatever to introducing it - in order to discover what is best practice and whether the increased transparency to which it would give rise increase transparency and empower those in opposition and in government to make better decisions in respect of budgetary processes in the future?<\/p><p>  Gone are the days when Ministers for Finance could take to their feet to deliver their budgets and even their Cabinet colleagues would not know what they were going to announce.  The budgetary position is improving, although there was much secrecy in respect of this year's budget.  The Government stepped back a bit in this regard but hopefully the position will be different in the future.  We need to be able to discuss positions in a proper and rational way before they become either policy or the subject of legislative provision.  In addition, these positions must be both evidence and fact-based.  Those of us in opposition rely on the Department of Finance and other Departments to provide the analysis we require.  Equality-proofing would be a very important tool and would allow us to consider what options or proposals we might wish to put forward in future pre-budget submissions.  I know the Minister will not accept the amendment but I ask him to indicate that he will consider the potential of the idea, what it would cost to implement, what constitutes best practice in other jurisdictions and whether it would be possible for the Department to engage in equality-proofing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600011#K00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362568800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.

This should be worked out from first principles with fairness written all over it.  At the moment it is all over the place.  The books on each Finance Act are getting thicker and thicker.  The tax return known as form 11 is now 23 pages long.  People are paralysed with the work of just putting bread and butter on the table.

As Deputy Boyd Barrett said with regard to the fairness index, as one goes above &euro;120,000, there should be an increasing contribution.<\/p><p>  I remember that in the 1970s surtax went to more than 70% in this country and more than 90% in Britain.

I agree with that proposition.  However, in debating the proposition, Deputy Doherty has not referred to the actual budgetary process.  The Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the present Administration drive the budget process forward, but all Departments are involved.  Many of the issues of equality, fairness and equal treatment to which the Deputy refers are subscribed to by the Department of Social Protection, which has an input into the budget.  The social measures are part of the budget and these have a separate Act.  The Social Welfare Bill was enacted immediately following the budget before Christmas.  That Act is driven by the Department of Social Protection, which takes into consideration all the actions that the Deputy says should be taken, such as the impact on individual groups and families of the changes made.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mathews spoke about looking at the whole engineering underpinning of the budget, which is expenditure and tax, but that has been done.  One of the first actions taken by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was to carry out a full review of expenditure.  Every Department and every agency was examined and the results were published.  The engineering has been examined in detail and there have been various commissions on taxation to examine the detail and the underpinnings on the tax side.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty, in a previous intervention, suggested that I had pulled the property tax proposal out of a clear blue sky without any analysis of the impact.  The property tax proposal was based on the report of the expert group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill, which we published.  The Deputy can read the analysis that was carried out in that report.  We are very close to what was reported.  We did not accept all the measures but the property tax proposals are very close to the proposals produced by Dr. Thornhill.<\/p><p>  The other part of the budgetary process is that we receive very large numbers of submissions, many of which come from voluntary groups who are experts in this regard.  I do not have a set of people in my Department who are experts on disability, for example.  While that kind of resource is probably available in the Department of Health or in the HSE, it is not available in the Department of Finance.  We received more than 1,000 pre-budget submissions, many of which were from voluntary organisations.  I met many of the groups but my officials met many more.  Therefore, there is a strong input from all of these organisations.  I suggest that the voluntary organisations dealing with people with disabilities, who are very supportive of them, are the best people to proof a budget or a finance Bill as to its impact on disabilities.  They do this all the time.<\/p><p>  Another part of the process which has not been taken into account is the examination by this committee.  The job of parliamentarians is to proof the proposals from me and the Government on the grounds of their economic impact and their impact on individual citizens.  I agree with the Deputy's proposition that if a budget is not about people it is not worth doing anyway.  It is all about people, in the final analysis.  There is a much wider process which does a lot of what the Deputy suggests.  The tax strategy group does strong work on analysis of tax proposals, and all of its documentation is published after the budget.<\/p><p>  I am only disagreeing with the Deputy on quite narrow grounds.  Where we consider a study is necessary to decide on the impact, economic and otherwise, we will do it.  However, if it is a study for the sake of having a study, which requires a lot of resources and man-hours in the Department, we simply are not that rich in resources.  The cuts in numbers in the public service have been applied to the Department of Finance also.  We have to deploy resources to get the best results.  More than any other Administration, we have carried out a series of economic impact studies.  Other Departments are also carrying out studies.  One of the emerging debates, which I presume will continue in the course of this year, is with regard to proposals about child benefit.  That study was commissioned and published by the Minister for Social Protection.  This is the basis for the analysis required by the Deputy.  Not everything is channelled through the Department of Finance.  I do not disagree in principle.  The more transparency there is in these processes, the better and the more democratic our process will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600012#L01000","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362569400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I will move on, because we have had a full debate on this matter.

This particular proposal is a modest measure with no costs to the Exchequer.  Its purpose is to remove a barrier which prevented small businesses from accessing the key employee relief.  Given that there is no additional cost to the Exchequer it does not make sense to wait a further year until data is available when we can help companies now.  Then everything is subject to review.<\/p><p>  There are many safeguards.  The new 50% criteria still requires that an employee spend the majority of his or her time performing research and development in order to be eligible.  In addition, the overall regime contains a number of other safeguards to prevent misuse.  First, the key employee cannot be a director or have a material interest in the company as this would potentially allow manipulation of the regime.  Second, before an employee can claim the benefit of the relief the employer must have paid all payroll taxes in respect of the employee's wages.  Third, an employee who claims the credit must file a tax return for the year of claims.  Fourth, when a company surrenders credit to a key employee it must record the fact and make a corporation tax return.  Fifth, the employee's tax rate cannot be deducted below 23% and the relief does not apply to the universal social charge or PRSI.  That effectively means that the employee will have a minimum effective rate of 30% in line with the high earners restriction.  Members will understand the policy arguments, and they have been recited before, that inventive people are a scarce commodity in any society.  People who can create a new product and patent it are a scarce commodity but they are also very mobile.  The provision is particularly tailored so that key inventive people in research and development companies can be rewarded because of their benefit to the State in due course.  <\/p><p>  My Department is conducting a review but I do not want to hold up the provision for 12 months when it is at no cost to the Exchequer.  I do not agree with a delay simply because of a review.  I ask the members to accept the provision then my Department will conduct a review.  It will be an all embracing review.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Will the Department examine the new measure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I have given latitude by allowing the committee to discuss section 5 again after it was agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Let us return to debating section 6 after Deputy Boyd Barrett makes a brief comment on section 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I wish to raise a key issue for women who are on maternity leave and whose employer does not pay them a salary during their maternity leave.  We all know that, in many instances, if a woman's husband or partner in work uses the tax bands and credits then her maternity benefit could be reduced significantly by taxation.<\/p><p>  Earlier I examined the interaction of social welfare and tax.  Will the Minister clarify the overall direction of policy?  It seems inconsistent in a number of respects.  Let us examine the schemes that are taxable and not taxable.  For example, the carer's allowance is taxable but the disability allowance is not taxable.  The blind pension is taxable but certain forms of jobseeker's benefit are not taxable.  The Minister is extending taxation into these three payments and I want to understand the policy behind his decision.  Are we moving to a position where all social welfare income will be fully taxable?  Are we moving in that direction?  What is the logic behind subjecting maternity benefit and these two other benefits to income tax when other forms of welfare payments remain untouched?  I would like to hear the logic behind the measure as it will have a clear impact on the recipients of maternity benefit.  It will have a significant impact on some people. <\/p><p>  The Minister has made the point before that some women might continue to be paid their salary.  Of course an employer will reduce a woman's salary so that it is the same as her maternity benefit.  If maternity benefit is not subjected to tax then she could end up better off.  I understand his point but many women are not paid anything other than maternity benefit during their maternity leave.  If their benefit is subject to tax then those women will be left in a difficult financial position.

I said then that I assumed that the Department would go after maternity benefit but the Minister did not pick up on my question at the time.  It is not as if the tax has fallen out of the sky.  We all knew that people who were paid by their employer benefitted through the taxation system from the non-taxation of the maternity benefit.  It is not something that landed on the Minister's desk in the past couple of months and he reacted by saying \"Oh my God, we need to stop this now.\"  The reason I say that is because the move was well known, established and accepted but not everybody gets that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600014#N01500","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>We are due to conclude this section at 12.30 p.m.  Rather than having questions and replies back and forth, if possible, we should try to complete the section before the vote is taken at 12.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600015#O00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I, too, am opposed to this section.

It comes down to whether we give full recognition to mothers and the service they are doing for society by having and looking after children.  It relates to the unfairness and cruelty of cuts to child benefit; the recognition which previously was given to women having and raising children as a contribution to society is now being withdrawn.  This is unfair, anti-women and anti-family.  The Minister should be upholding and expanding that recognition to acknowledge what women do for society.

I will then try to deal with the individual queries raised.<\/p><p>  Employees paying full PRSI, including civil and public servants appointed after 1995, are entitled under the Social Welfare Acts to maternity benefit payments payable by the Department of Social Protection.  These benefits consist of the following payments: maternity benefit and adoptive benefit in Annex 1 and health and safety benefit in Annexe 2.<\/p><p>  Maternity benefit is a payment for employed and self-employed individuals who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions on their own social insurance record.  The current rate payable depends only on the recipient's earnings in the relevant tax year and is subject to a minimum payment of &euro;217.80 and a maximum payment of &euro;262 a week.  Maternity benefit is currently payable for 26 weeks and some 90% of claimants are paid a maximum &euro;262 per week, which equates to a total payment of &euro;6,812.<\/p><p>  Many employers, including most Departments and State agencies, continue to pay normal salary to employees while they are on maternity, adoptive or health and safety leave.  Currently, the relevant social welfare payments are not taxable.  In circumstances where an employee continues to be paid by her employer in full while on maternity leave, the current non-taxation of these payments results in such an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period she is out of work than she would have if in work.  It was never the policy intention that a financial gain would accrue to those on such leave.  The current system that allows a gain for some recipients of such benefits is anomalous and unsustainable in current economic circumstances.  As members will recall, I took a similar approach to illness and occupational injury benefits in the Finance Act 2012 to avoid a similar situation.  In line with all social protection payments, these benefit payments will continue to be exempt from the universal social charge and PRSI.  The charging of income tax on these benefit payments will commence on 1 July 2013.  The anticipated income tax yield in 2013 is &euro;15 million, with a yield of &euro;40 million in a full year.  It is a significant yield, as members will see, because the payment is quite big.  I have outlined part of the general policy that persons should not enjoy bigger take-home pay while out of work than in work.<\/p><p>  On the overall principle of taxation in regard to social welfare payments, the general principle is that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be treated equally for taxation purposes.  In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as the disability benefit, the State pension, widow's, invalidity and blind person's pension, carer's allowances, the one parent family payment, as well as short-term benefits such as jobseeker's benefits.  Treating these payments for income tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  I am not saying that if one's only income is from these sources it is taxable.  Clearly, it is below the threshold for tax, but when there is other income in addition to these benefits, they are reckonable for tax.

The Minister said it was never the policy that women would benefit.  The Department of Finance has provided a note to all employers - I am one myself - indicating that maternity benefit is not classed as income.  It was always the position of the Department and it is provided for in the legislation that it is not part of income.  Obviously, those receiving additional income would be better off when they were on maternity leave.  This is a cruel tax and &euro;40 million is a huge amount of money to be brought in.  The Minister is talking about women who are pregnant now and will give birth to a child after 1 July 2013.  If they are in employment paying a higher rate of tax, they will each end up paying at least &euro;2,500 more to the tax man than if the section did not exist.  It is a grab.  There are other ways to bring in money.  To target pregnant women is not the right way to do it.  We have not even spoken about the health and safety benefit in terms of taxation which is equally cruel.  Women who are pregnant and go on leave to nurse their children will pay &euro;2,500 to &euro;2,600 in additional tax if they are in the higher band while taking a reduction in child benefit.

I am mindful of the fact that some individuals who commenced work on the construction or improvement of their homes in 2012 were unable to complete such work in time to be able to avail of the relief on that part of their loan taken out and used in 2013.  I have accordingly introduced measures aimed at ensuring that such individuals will be able to avail of mortgage interest relief subject to certain conditions.  Mortgage interest relief will now be available for the tax years 2013 to 2017 in respect of interest paid on a loan taken out in 2013 to construct a home or a site but only where such site was bought by way of a loan taken out in 2012, and on interest paid on a loan to repair, develop or improve a home but only where loan approval was in place in 2012 and part of the loan was used in 2012 and the balance was used in 2013 on such repair, development or improvement.   Before relief will be granted, any necessary planning permission must have been in place on or before 31 December 2012.  This is to remove anomalies in the section.<\/p><p>  Members will recall that double interest relief on mortgages was given as an incentive to persons who purchased their homes in 2012 but an anomaly arose where persons rather than purchasing were either building or extending their homes and part of the loan was drawn down in 2012, work was not completed and when they drew down the second part of the loan to complete the work they did not get the relief.

This measure must be viewed in the context of what is happening for third level students or prospective third level students and their parents and what is happening for the colleges.  We know that education fees are rising.  We also know that disposable income of students or their parents is falling and that third level funding from the Government is falling dramatically.  Between 2008 and 2015 there will be approximately a 50% cut in higher education funding per student in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This measure on its own might be a somewhat marginal issue but it is part of a trend that is making college unaffordable to a certain number of people.

The registration fee, which has been renamed the student contribution fee, was &euro;2,000 in 2011 and in 2012 it increased to &euro;2,250.  The Minister signalled it will increase to &euro;2,500, &euro;2750 and &euro;3,000 in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.  As part of the original arrangement, because the measure was introduced in 2011 to get a larger contribution for students and their parents for third level education, there was a disregard of the equivalent amount for tax purposes.  When it was &euro;2,250, as it was in 2012, there was a disregard or, in other words, it could not be claimed against tax.  We are following the education policy.  The Department of Education and Skills is increasing the sum to &euro;2,500 so we are maintaining the disregard as equivalent to the student contribution.  We are not the policymakers, we are applying tax policy to the new level of student contribution.  It will continue until 2015.  It was part of the contribution of the Department of Education and Skills to the third level education budget by taking an extra student contribution from certain students.<\/p><p>  Something analogous happens with part-time courses.  Where all the fees relate to part-time courses, the section provides for an increase in the amount disregarded for the purposes of the relief.

The amendment maintains the policy of the Government previously in this area such that families with more than one student in third level education can claim tax relief for the student contribution payable in respect of the second and subsequent students.  To put it briefly, the Department of Education and Skills is leading the policy and taking the student contribution from &euro;2,250 to &euro;2,500 in 2013.  The Department is doing this as a contribution to its budget and its transfers to the higher education sector.  Tax policy is following the education policy in saying the disregard will be the equivalent of the student fee.  In other words, parents cannot claim the student contribution against their income tax.  On the other hand, if there is more than one member of the family in college, the parents can claim the student contribution against their personal taxes for the second or subsequent children in third level education.

They are taking the fees up to &euro;3,000.  For example, one can take the case of a person who is studying medicine and one can add on numbers for the extra years.  It is a rather small imposition.<\/p><p>  I will address the tax breaks on private education.  The disregard is the same across the sector.  The private education sector is not partially funded by the taxpayer, whereas the public sector education is funded by the taxpayer.  If a child goes to a private school the cap for tax relief is &euro;7,000 per course per annum.  They do not distinguish between the courses.  That is the maximum in terms of fees that can be applied for as a tax relief.  This is done to equalise the situation between the private and the public sector.  The private sector third level education providers do not get any subsidies.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the SARP arrangement, which we discussed at length.  The IDA advocated for the special assignee relief programme, SARP scheme because it found that the lack of provisions such as this, which were available in other jurisdictions, made it difficult to bring key employees into industry in Ireland.  Very often the availability of the key employee could generate a whole section in a plant and could lead to the employment of several Irish people.  There is no tax relief for students of such persons in third level education.  The reliefs apply to primary and secondary education.  It is at the discretion of the employer and the guidelines would suggest that in cases in which a family come from abroad and the children have difficulty with the English language, they may have to go to a school that specialises in that or gives extra assistance and then the employer can invoke this clause.  It does not apply to third level.  It is not analogous to anything we are doing here.<\/p><p>  The final point is that what ever way one runs the numbers, they do not seem to be inhibiting attendance at third level colleges.  The numbers in third level education is at the highest ever, in excess of 180,000 students.  I know parents are making great sacrifices to keep them there and it is not easy for a great many people.  I know the grant system is of great assistance but the fact is that the policies being pursued by the Minister for Education and Skills at present on the global figures seems to be facilitating a great many people to attend university.  The figure is at the highest ever in the history of the country.  That is a reasonable achievement for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  We should be proud that we have a record number of 180,000 people in third level education. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600022#W00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575100,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Minister knows the reason that so many are in education - there are no jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600022#W00900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Deputy sees the bad side of everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600022#W01000","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575100,"counter":356,"content":"<p>No, I do not.

I have got another note stating that the next review will take place in preparation for the budget.  Rather than it being up against budget night, it will be reviewed in October in building up the budgetary arithmetic; therefore we are only six or seven months away from the review.

Before the Finance Bill is enacted the specified rate on home loans is 5%.  If an employee has a home loan, through his or her employment, for less than that rate, 4.7% or 4.8%, that is deemed to be a preferential rate and he or she pays a benefit-in-kind on the differential.  That is the existing position.  I would not regard a rate of 4.7%, 4.8% or 4.9% as being preferential at this point in time.  It is not.  Generally speaking, the others are between 4% and 4.5%.  I would regard 4% as a better benchmark of what might or might not be preferential at this point in time.  That could change in the next 12 months.  Certainly, in terms of where the market is today, charging benefit-in-kind on an employee who is paying 4.9% on a home loan rate is not reasonable, so that what the Minister is doing makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600024#Y00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576300,"counter":403,"content":"<p>This is a technical exercise which is carried out by the officials on the advice of the Central Bank.

This area has been the subject of much commentary over the past number of years and I welcome the move the Minister is making in this area to allow people, in limited circumstances, to draw down some of the moneys that have been paid into their pension schemes.  I acknowledge this is an area of policy where the Minister needs to be careful and we certainly need to ensure that people are incentivised to continue to provide for their retirement.  However, the Minister could have gone further.  What he has done is very narrow in its scope, although it is a first step.  For example, the type of contributions that are excluded from this initiative include employer-paid contributions, regular employee contributions, self-employed personal pensions, normal PRSAs and AVCs made for the purposes of purchasing notional added years.  Therefore, this provision is only a tentative first step towards allowing access to pension funds in certain limited circumstances.  <\/p><p>  My amendment calls for a report on the broader possibilities of allowing limited access to employer-paid and employee contributions and certain self-employed and PRSA contributions.  I note the money drawn down under the Minister's proposal will be subject to income tax at that marginal rate and he projects a yield of approximately &euro;100 million this year from that measure.  Amendment No. 17 proposes that a person would be allowed to draw down money under this measure, but from the taxation perspective that what they draw down could be set off against the tax free retirement lump sum so as to further incentivise people to draw down some money under limited circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600025#Z01200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1362576900,"counter":417,"content":"<p>It is worth reflecting on the policy position before I read my briefing note.  Pension provision is very important for both the individuals making the provision and for society as a whole.  People are very anxious to make provision for their old age and that is the reason there are so many incentives to encourage people to make provision for their retirement.  We can all share that position.<\/p><p>  AVCs are additional voluntary contributions.  These were introduced so that people who had not, for one reason or another, made full provision for their retirement through the scheme they had or who felt they needed to make additional provision for their retirement, could do so in certain circumstances.  Therefore, the introduction of any kind of broad measure which would undermine pension schemes by the withdrawal of AVCs was something I had to be cautious about and needed to reflect on very carefully.  The approach is that we will not incentivise a draw down by providing a tax break or encouraging it.  We are also making the provision a temporary one as we do not want it to become a permanent feature of pension policy. <\/p><p>  Our approach is that because many people have debts with which they want to deal or with which they cannot cope, but have money in an AVC, we will allow them make a different decision about their lives now and remove some of the moneys from their AVC.  This does not take away from the fact that some people might be tempted to deal with a temporary problem by impairing the permanent provisions they have been making for their retirement.  It is within that area the decisions are being made.  I decided it was a good idea to let people access AVCs, but with limitations on that access.  First, they can access only up to 30%.  Second, we would not incentivise a draw down so that people would make a neutral decision, without tax considerations pulling them in either direction.  Obviously, pension contributions would have got tax relief at the point of entry and it is, therefore, reasonable to tax them at the point of exit. <\/p><p>  I do not think my speaking note adds much to this, but I will read it for the Deputy.  In amendment No. 15 the Deputy proposes the preparation of a report for the House on preretirement access to all forms of pension savings in certain unspecified circumstances.  I assume the Deputy's proposal is prompted by the inclusion in section 16 of the Bill of provisions for limited pre-retirement access to additional voluntary contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600025#Z01300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362577500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Is this the limit to which the Minister is going to allow access to pension funds?

I propose to deal with them together by agreement.  Section 16 inserts a new section 782A to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and provides for limited pre-retirement access to additional voluntary contributions.  It also provides for the temporary rescinding of certain provisions included in the Finance Act 2011 relating to the conditions that must be met by an individual before he or she can have access to an approved retirement fund, ARF.  In the Finance Act 2011 changes were made in the context of the extension of the ARF option to all defined contribution occupational pension arrangements.<\/p><p>  The amendments are primarily for the purpose of clarifying elements of the AVC access provision and use some of the administrative aspects of that proposal to ensure that it gets up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The amendments in part reflect feedback received by my Department since the Bill was published.  Amendment No. 16 corrects the omission of a reference in section 770(3) to the new Schedule 23C and sets out the information reporting requirements of PRSA administrators in respect of AVC access provision.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 18 and 23 are similar in intent and are designed, as mentioned earlier, to get the AVC access option operational as quickly as possible.  In this regard in order for the AVC access legislation to be effective the Bill as published would oblige the trustees of occupational pension schemes and PRSA providers, respectively, to make specific provision for the access option in their schemes and PRSA products by amending scheme rules or the terms of the products.  It has been put to me that this requirement would inevitably cause delays and give rise to administrative costs as rules and terms are redrafted and trustees meet to consider them before the amendments become effective.  Having regard to these concerns and the fact that AVC access is a purely temporary facility the amendments replace the rule change requirement in the published provision with an overarching provision that effectively permits trustees and PRSA providers to allow scheme members or PRSA contract holders to avail of the AVC access option notwithstanding that the scheme rule or product term as approved by Revenue would ordinarily not allow for such access.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 19 replaces an incorrect reference to &quot;trustees&quot; in the definition of the term accumulated value in the new section 782A with a correct reference to &quot;administrator&quot;.  Amendment No. 20 replaces the definition of administrator in the new section 782A with a more precise definition to clarify that the administrator of an AVC fund who will in effect be administering the AVC access option is the person or persons who actually manage the relevant pension scheme on a day-to-day basis, whether the main scheme or a separate but associated AVC scheme or the PRSA administrator where it is a PRSA AVC scheme.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 extend the period within which pension scheme administrators and PRSA administrators, respectively, must provide information to Revenue in respect of the use of AVC access options from seven days to 15 days after the end of each quarter.  I commend all these amendments to the committee.<\/p><p>  If Deputy Doherty wishes to propose his amendment I can read the briefing note on it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600027#BB00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I will propose the amendment if the Minister will read the briefing note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600027#BB00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 22 tabled by Deputy Doherty proposes to delete the proposed new section 782A(2) of the principal Act in section 16, which provides for the reversal of the more stringent ARF access conditions introduced in the Finance Act 2011.  It may help to inform the discussion on the amendment if I outlined the rationale for the reversal of the 2011 charges.  The relevant ARF access conditions hold that before an individual can invest in an ARF he or she must have a minimum guaranteed pension income for life or, in the absence of that minimum level of pension income, he or she must set aside part of the pension pot in an approved minimum retirement fund which, in general, cannot be accessed until the individual reaches the age of 75.<\/p><p>  In the Finance Act 2011 the minimum guaranteed pension income requirement was increased from &euro;12,700 per annum to an amount equal to 1.5 times the State pension contributory.  This figure is currently &euro;18,000.  The increase in the maximum set aside amount required to be placed in an approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF, went from &euro;63,500 to an amount equal to ten times the rate of the State pension contributory.  This amounts currently to &euro;119,800.  These changes were made in the context of the extension in the Finance Act 2011 of the ARF option to all defined contribution main scheme benefits.  I imagine Deputy Doherty would agree that the level of pension income in pension fund savings figures reflected in the ARF access conditions indicate that the individuals most impacted by the changes made in 2011 were not high earners but people on modest pension incomes or with modest pension savings.<\/p><p>  I have received representations about the fact that these changes which represented relatively significant overnight increases to the limits were introduced without the provision of adequate transitional arrangements.  It has been put to me that it was unfair that many individuals who had been planning for retirement based on the original requirements of the legislation were suddenly faced, and continue to be faced, with having to meet more stringent conditions without a sufficient period of transition during which the old rules would continue to apply.  This is the reason I have decided to reinstate the old limits of &euro;12,700 and &euro;63,500 for a limited period of three years.  In effect the Deputy is proposing that the case for such temporary transitional arrangements, which would mostly affect individuals with modest means, should not be entertained and on that basis I cannot commend amendment No. 22 to the committee.<\/p><p>  We increased limits last year for access to ARFs.  In practice the changes appear to have been excessive.  We did it on the basis that we were dealing with people of high income but when people began to get access it was those on relatively modest means who led the application list.  It was a fair criticism that transitional arrangements were not put in place.  Now, for a temporary three-year period, we are going back to the older, lower-level limits and this will allow a transitional period.  Then, the higher income limits to which Deputy Doherty refers in his amendment will be reinstated, perhaps by way of legislation in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600027#BB00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578100,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister said in terms of the shock to individuals because of the drastic increase.  The effect of this amendment will also be of benefit to the Exchequer because by pushing more money into ARFs it becomes applicable to the imputed distribution charge.

It is a matter of judgment.  Iwould be very cautious in opening up access to AVCs.  That is the reason we are not incentivising it by giving tax relief.  We are keeping it at a low percentage of 30% and for a temporary period.  ARFs would not apply to as many as the AVCs, but there are similar considerations.  It is an arcane issue, into which we do not often have an insight.  It is, therefore, a case of using best judgment.  The Department does not respond to a couple of inquiries, but there were inquiries at which people were represented directly and also by the industry.  They stated they were within three or four years of retirement, that they had planned to organise their affairs in a particular way in respect of the ARFs and that because the level had been increased so dramatically, they could no longer do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600028#CC00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>In reducing the limits on the AMRF, approved minimum retirement fund, the Minister is forcing the amount currently in the fund into an ARF.

It is not built into the budget figures.  The changes are being made in response to a strong case that the 2011 Finance Act increased the guaranteed pension income requirement and that the maximum AMRF set-aside amount did not provide for adequate transitional arrangements for individuals planning to avail of the AR-PREF option and who were close to retirement.  The Finance Bill 2013 provisions provide for such transitional arrangements in the next few years.  They will ensure equitable treatment in so far as it is possible to do so for individuals affected by the 2011 changes.<\/p><p>  The amendments made in the Bill will make it easier for individuals with modest defined contribution pension savings to have access to an ARF and control over their income in retirement.  It must be borne in mind that distributions from ARFs are liable to tax at the ARF owner's marginal rate, in the same way as income derived from a pension annuity.  Individuals with ARFs worth less than &euro;2 million must draw down at least 5% of the value each year or it will be assumed that they have done so.  They will be subject to tax on that 5% or the difference between that percentage and what they actually draw down.<\/p><p>  A higher notional distribution rate of 6% applies to ARFs valued at &euro;2 million and over.  The notional distribution arrangements do not apply to the AMRFs.  The ARF option, as it is known, of which the AMRF is part, is not an arrangement to avoid the taxes outlined where individuals aged under 75 years do not need the guaranteed pension income limit necessary to have an ARF now reduced to its previous level of &euro;12,700 per annum.  They have a choice either to buy a pension annuity with their remaining pension pot or place a maximum of &euro;63,500 or the balance of the pension pot, if lower, into an AMRF.  The capital sum in the AMRF is not accessible until an individual reaches the age of 75 years, unless he or she satisfies the guaranteed pension income requirement or decide to purchase a pension annuity in the meantime.  When the AMRF owner reaches the age of 75 years, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF, distributions from which are subject to tax or notional distributions are assumed and taxed where actual distributions are not made.<\/p><p>  There is a lot of technical information.  It is an area about which one would not be questioned too often in one's advice clinic and I am relying on notes.  I have no great personal familiarity with it.  The Deputy can take it, however, that the motivation was not to collect revenue.  That is a consequence of this provision and it will be a small yield.  Persons of an age where they are looking at retirement in three or four years time have suddenly found that what they had planned is now not possible.  We are going back to the original limits in order that what they had planned is possible.  Effectively, we are giving everyone else three year notice that the new caps will be applied in 2016 and that we will legislate on that basis.  That is the best I can do to help the Deputy's understanding of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600028#CC00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578700,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I appreciate and understand the rationale.

One would only need a very small additional sum to have the rest of one's money forced into an ARF which is subject to tax, while the AMRF is not subject.  This is a source of concern.

In the context of people having adequate pension provision, I understand AVCs only apply to occupational pension schemes and that they do not apply to the self-employed or directors who are involved in company pension schemes.  The State's only exposure is in terms of the qualifying adult, namely, anyone who qualifies for a contributory old age pension, regardless of his or her means.  The only exposure would be in respect of a qualifying adult when he or she makes a claim on reaching retirement age.  Will the Minister consider opting for a figure much lower than 30% for the self-employed and directors?  He is probably well aware that access to credit and cash is very much an issue for the self-employed.  Perhaps it might be possible to use a more restrictive mechanism to access AVCs by opting for a much smaller percentage.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister comment on this issue, particularly as it continues to arise?  I welcome the measure introduced because it is very progressive.  What I am suggesting would link with what is being proposed in the context of ensuring people make proper pension provision.

One of the considerations of which I remain aware is the fact that while it is designed to provide relief for persons in temporary financial difficulty, we want to proceed in a way which will not impair their provisions for their retirement.  In that regard, we must consider the position of those to whom these individuals owe money.  Would it be possible, for example, for a bank to state, \"It is now legal to access your AVCs, please withdraw 30% of your voluntary contributions and give them to us\"?  There is an obvious risk in this regard and we must be very cautious in how we proceed.<\/p><p>  I am not rejecting any of the proposals Deputies Kieran O'Donnell, Pearse Doherty or Michael McGrath are making, I am simply stating the prudent way to proceed is to wait for the publication of the study of pensions commissioned by the Minister for Social Protection.

I am aware of the proposal in respect of the 30% category who are exempt from liability to the USC and PRSI.

Many of the representations I have received on this issue over the last year or so have been from ordinary individuals who found themselves in financial difficulties and were seeking some access to their pension savings in order, for example, to facilitate debt repayment.  I did not see any merit in introducing the facility for limited AVC access on the one hand while at the same time imposing a rate of reduction that would to all intents and purposes largely frustrate the initiative at the outset.  At the end of the day this is a policy call and in my view the imposition of the marginal rate of income tax on such payments gets the balance right.  The policy decision was to tax on exit at 41% but not to add on the USC or PRSI.  It was a policy decision because 41% is a big deduction if one is drawing out funds from AVCs to clear debt.  If another 11% were to be taken off it, it defeats the purpose of putting in the enabling provision.

They are not low income individuals.  I say that because they have to have a certain amount of pension.  These are additional voluntary contributions and therefore it is additional to the requirement of one's pension.  A large number of people do not have private pensions, which will be hugely troublesome for the country in the future.  There is another cadre of people who have private pensions, but there is another group of people who can afford to add to them.  The only people being facilitated under this Bill are those who had enough money at the time to add to them.  In terms of what the Minister has done, if we consider the person on the lower income who has just built up their pension pot, when they start to draw it down they will pay the full USC plus their income tax rate whereas the people who had an additional amount of money can get an incentive in whatever way the Minister wants to frame it.

I do not have typical profiles of persons who contribute to additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, but from constituency experience, many of the people I come across who have AVCs are women whose career was interrupted because they spent some time looking after family or people who returned home after several years working abroad who wanted to enhance their pension schemes, again because of the shortness of their career.  The same would apply to persons who had long periods of unemployment, or indeed short periods of unemployment, that interrupted their contribution record.<\/p><p>  In terms of somebody who has additional voluntary contributions, it is their own money.  We are enabling them to take out 30% of what they put in.  When one's pension matures, it is different because one is getting a pension arising from the pension fund.  If there is no fund in the public service, for example, one is not taking out what one put in.  One is getting the benefit of the scheme in whatever way that scheme is designed.  They are different situations.  In this case somebody is accessing the money they put in by way of voluntary contribution.  If they wait until it matures, the person on the occupational pension is getting the benefit of the pension scheme, whatever that may be.  In many cases across the public service there was no fund until various amendments were made.  There was not much of a connection between the contributions made and the benefits that accrued subsequently.

A portion of it is their own money; the remainder is made up of the State's contribution through tax reliefs.  I will come back to that.  This is a question of fairness.  When an individual who has put money into a pension fund draws that down, whether it is an AVC, an approved retirement fund, ARF, or whatever, and they have to pay income tax at whatever rate they are on in addition to USC, that should apply to those individuals who had additional money to put into their pension pot.  That is just a question of fairness.<\/p><p>  The Minister said that applying the marginal rate in the legislation is high enough, but the legislation does not apply the marginal rate.  The legislation allows for the standard rate to apply.  I will not cite where it is in the legislation, but where an individual can show that they fall into the standard rate category, they can write to the Revenue and get it based at 20% instead of 41%.  Let us deal with that.<\/p><p>  I understand that a person who put money into an AVC two years ago got a 41% reduction in tax relief as well as a relief or a rebate in terms of PRSI that amounted to just over 2.5%.  Therefore, the State contributed approximately 43% of their AVC.  The reason many of them are looking for this money is that they have fallen on hard times.  They might have lost their job.  Many of them could be falling into the standard rate of tax and therefore the only tax that would apply on their rebate would be 20%.  An issue of fairness arises in that respect in that they got the relief of 41% but the rate that would apply on the money withdrawn would be 20%.  This is standard.<\/p><p>  I want to quote from the Garda Representative Association's advice to its members on their AVC proposal.  It gives tables on the profit one would make from investing &euro;10,000 in an AVC, which is &euro;4,095.  That is because of the tax relief I mentioned earlier.  It refers to a member who retires.  This is the GRA and therefore we are talking about garda&iacute;.  I am not picking on garda&iacute;.  We know the average wages members of the Garda are on, which are not in any way excessive.  It states:<blockquote>When a member retires, with 30 years service, his annual pension is calculated as 50% of his superannuation earnings.  [That is the same with all public sector workers].  This puts a member with no other income firmly in the 20% tax bracket.  Your AVC plan uses this position by allowing you put money you earn today and is taxed @ 41% into an AVC account, get full tax and PRSI relief on the contribution which is given automatically by garda pay, and then draw down the money after retiring at 20% tax.<\/blockquote>  In terms of the argument about tax reliefs for pensions, it is supposed to be a deferred taxation payment but in reality it is not because they get the relief at 41% and then because the income of their pension is below the threshold for marginal tax, they are only paying 20%.  That is a wider issue that we need to deal with in the future, but my concern is that many people who would withdraw money from their AVCs will also fall into this bracket.  They will have got the marginal tax relief if they put &euro;10,000 into an AVC.  The State gave them &euro;4,100 back in tax relief, and the rebate on PRSI is 2%, which is another &euro;200.  Basically, the State contributed that money to their AVC on their behalf in the expectation that when they draw down the money, they would get the money back through the tax, but what will happen is that it will only get &euro;2,000 of it back, which is the standard rate of tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600031#FF00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580500,"counter":527,"content":"<p>On the issue of what tax applies to contributions to pension funds, it is the marginal rate of tax.

This is a way of making profit for individuals.  If one has enough money to invest in an AVC, particularly at the latter end where one can invest something like 40% of one's income in respect of this year, this is how one basically avoids tax.  When we develop a tax code, there will always be people who perhaps will not avoid tax but will benefit from the taxation system.  The incentivisation of pensions is about making sure people have enough money set aside for their retirement.  It was never intended to allow people to invest in pensions at the later stages of their working lives so that they would get a relief of 41% at that point in time.  As cases involving the garda&iacute; and many other people have shown, they know that if it is the only source of income they have when they are drawing that down, it will fall into the 20% bracket resulting in a 21% profit.  This needs to be dealt with in the future, particularly the huge rush to invest money at that later point solely for that reason.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the word \"incentivise\" is the wrong one because anybody with an AVC who decides to tap into it at this point is under financial pressure of one kind or another.

There is an issue of fairness here.  We are basically giving up on tax by the State.  We should not be encouraging people to tap into their AVCs.  I do not object to the section given that there are constraints.  It will not incentivise them but there should be fairness here.  The USC should also be applied because that is the system that applies across the board and that should apply for AVCs so we can genuinely say there is no incentive to tap into one's AVC at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600032#GG00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362581100,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I do not believe that AVCs will be accessed universally by people with debt problems or financial crises.

Section 17 deals only with trades dealing in or developing land; therefore, it has no implications for other trades or debt relief on mortgages.  The purpose of the losses provisions in the Finance Acts is to allow relief on genuine losses.  This section is aimed at situations where a taxpayer buys land for development but has until now claimed a tax deduction where the land falls in value.  That is fine if the taxpayer buys the land from his own resources.  If, however, he or she borrows to buy it, it falls in value and is sold and the bank only gets back the proceeds of the sale, there is no economic loss to the taxpayer.  The effect of the section is to balance the loss on the land with the amount of the loan write-off.  If I remember correctly, the Personal Insolvency Bill states a write-down of mortgage debt cannot be treated as benefit-in-kind; therefore, this will not affect someone who negotiates a write-down of a mortgage debt.  It is specifically tied to somebody involved in the trade of building and developing.  They buy land with borrowed money, the land falls in value and the bank only gets the sale price.

The incentive was originally put in place in 2003 and the rules governing it require that an applicant company obtains a clearance certificate from Enterprise Ireland.

The amendment does not challenge the Government's aims but asks the Minister to commit to examine and review the employment and investment incentive and seed capital scheme in advance of budget 2014 to establish the effects on employment levels and new jobs.  There are questions to answer given that only 335 certificates were issued, the majority in the earlier years of the scheme's operation.  The scheme has been in operation for ten years and there is a very low take-up of it.  Given that county enterprise boards do not know it exists, there are obvious difficulties and problems with it.<\/p><p>  While I do not question the Minister's intention in expanding the scheme, there is a problem somewhere.

Before the new scheme was introduced, as I said in my previous remarks, there was an <i>ex ante<\/i> evaluation of the benefits of the new scheme.  I have been asked how well the scheme has operated since its introduction in the last days of November 2011 but a full year's figures are still not available.

That is being done right across Departments.  Many of the most interesting changes taking place are in that space; for example, the current inward investment record.

Just over 2.6% of IDA investment in the State last year went to areas with 50% of the population.  While the IDA was able to celebrate a better year, as was Enterprise Ireland, the problem is that the concentration of investment by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland is in Cork and Dublin.  In the past, Finance Bills have tried to encourage incentives in certain areas but these did not work out and were detrimental.  This is true of section 23 measures in some areas.  While it is good for the State that the IDA has had a good year, the issue of regional development has gone off the boil.

While the IDA encourages foreign direct investment to come to Ireland, when it is successful the company it has attracted selects the location.  The IDA does not select it.  The companies are selecting Dublin, Cork and Galway for a variety of reasons and the selection tends to be urban rather than rural.  Previously, there was a variation on incentives, with bigger incentives available in certain parts of the country.  That attracted investment because an extra margin was available.  The incentive range has equalised for most modern industry and is not as great a factor.  Important factors now are the 12.5% tax rate and the ability of a skilled and educated labour force which tends to drive industry towards university cities.  Another factor is proximity to an airport, preferably an international airport.<\/p><p>  Increasingly, the literature suggests that industry is attracted to locate in creative communities, communities that are pluralist, non-judgmental, and engage with and accept different lifestyles and cultures.  These are the kind of cities that are growing rapidly and they attract the creative kind of people who are the lifeblood of modern industry.  We are living in a very connected society and sometimes people locally promoting their own location do not see the wider factors.  In what I have described, Dublin is a great fit at this stage because it has become a most interesting multicultural, non-judgmental place to live where different lifestyles are appreciated and people can go about their business.  These issues are well worth considering when we are looking at incentives.<\/p><p>  The solution for the constituencies of Deputy Doherty and me involves incentivising SMEs, having regard to the needs of exporting SMEs and the level of entrepreneurship that can be encouraged around the country.  Entrepreneurship is not confined to a number of locations.  There is now an emerging entrepreneurial group of young people who we meet all the time.  We must start thinking about how to incentivise them to form the new base for industry, which has a more regional application.

My understanding is that if one owns a Georgian house in Limerick that fits the criteria specified by the legislation in terms of a Georgian house and one lives in the first and second floors of the house and have a business in the basement and on the first floor one can spend substantial sums upgrading the house and get 100% tax relief on the upgrade, depending on having a taxable income to offset it over a period of ten years.  I have a number of concerns.  People will get their property tax letters next week.  As I said on Second Stage, there are less affluent areas of Limerick and people in these areas do not get any relief for upgrading their houses or for works they deem fit to bring up the standard of their house.  However, the owner of a Georgian house will be able to avail of this relief.  I question the fairness of this relief.<\/p><p>  On a main street one could have a Georgian house and an adjacent property that is not a Georgian house that are in competition to rent out the ground floor as office or retail space.  From my reading of the section, it allows the owner of the Georgian house to upgrade the ground floor office or retail space of the house as long as he or she is living in the upper two stories and this gives an additional incentive to businesses to locate in Georgian properties.  I am quite concerned that houses other than Georgian houses will find it more difficult to attract the same type of business to their property.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that it is a pilot scheme, but it offers significant relief to the owners of Georgian properties.

The scheme which will be introduced by ministerial order is entitled the living city initiative and will apply in the first instance on a pilot basis to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.<\/p><p>  My Department has prepared an information note on this incentive which was published on the Department's website on 13 February last.  The historic centres of some of our cities have suffered for a long time from gradual depopulation and the relocation of family homes and businesses to the suburbs, particularly during the period of the Celtic Tiger.  These centres have also suffered greatly from the general economic downturn of the past few years.  While I am not suggesting that this scheme is capable on its own of reversing that trend, I am convinced that it has a part to play.  The particular focus of the scheme is as follows: to encourage people back to the centres of Irish cities to live in historical buildings, in particular Georgian houses; and to encourage the regeneration of the retail heartland of central city business districts.<\/p><p>  I indicated in my budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas.  The tax relief that will apply under this scheme will operate for five years from the date of commencement.  However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be subject to an <i>ex ante  <\/i>cost benefit analysis and, subject to a positive outcome from the analysis, I will seek EU approval under state aid rules for this initiated to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities.  I have not yet decided on the exact boundaries of the regeneration areas in these cities but I will be consulting with my Government colleagues and the relevant local authorities beforehand before I make any final decision.<\/p><p>  There are two strands to the scheme.  The first involves a tax relief for the refurbishment or conversion of Georgian houses for residential purposes.  The relief will only apply to owner occupiers and not for rented residential accommodation.  It is not a section 23 provision, which was relief for investors.  This is a scheme for people who will live in the cities and move back from the suburbs and make living cities out of the derelict areas again.  The relief will be spread over ten years at a rate of 10% of the expenditure per annum, provided the property is occupied as the principal private residence of the individual during that time.  No relief can be transferred to any subsequent purchaser or to offset rent from any other building, which was a big feature of the previous tax incentives.  It will be necessary for the individual to have received confirmation from the relevant local authority that the property conforms to planning permission if required, appropriate building regulations and floor area limits and the costs of works seem reasonable before the relief can be claimed.<\/p><p>  The second strand is a scheme of accelerated industrial buildings allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of retail premises although other business services will also be allowed where the premises is a Georgian building.  In such cases the commercial element will be confined to the ground floor or basement with a residential element upstairs.  The allowance is at a rate of 15% per annum for six years and 10% in year seven and is subject to the normal balancing charges of allowances if disposed of within that time period.<\/p><p>  The standard restrictions on the sideways setting of unused capital allowance against other income will apply.  There will be no exemption from the current treatment of the termination of the carry forward of certain unused capital allowances for passive investors.  Furthermore the high earners restriction which applies cross the full range of reliefs such as this also applies to this relief.<\/p><p>  I hope these reliefs will help to restore some of these inner city areas to their former glory.  The prevalence of Georgian houses is a particular characteristic of the built environment of many Irish cities.  While some of these Georgian buildings have fallen into a state of disrepair and dereliction, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I have been exploring ways in which to promote and support the regeneration of these city centres.  The reliefs I am introducing are an attempt to encourage people back into the cities to raise their families and if possible to operate their businesses from there.  It will not be possible to revitalise these inner city areas without this happening.  Pobal, the State agency that supports local communities, has developed a sophisticated index which measures deprivation in different local areas across Ireland.  Taking into account the deprivation statistics from the 2011 census, both Limerick and Waterford scored as the most disadvantaged of our major cities.  Furthermore unemployment rates in these cities are also the highest, significantly worse than the national average.  Both have their own unique problems regarding unemployment and social problems and for these reasons I have selected them for the pilot phase of this initiative.<\/p><p>  I understand Limerick better than I understand Waterford but the Government has decided that these two cities need to be treated with special measures to see what will work out.  What has happened in Limerick is that a very imaginative regeneration scheme was brought in for local authority suburbs in the outer margins of the city which is beginning to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600037#NN00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362584400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>The Minister wants to put some jam in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600038#OO00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362584400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I put it to the Deputy that market forces alone will not change the current position.  I invite him to come to Limerick and walk through Newtown Pery, which is the city's recognised Georgian area.  If he does, he will immediately grasp this concept.  Individual Georgian buildings in the city do not take the form of four storeys over a basement.  Some of them are two-storey buildings.  The new local authority, following merger of the city and county councils, intends to develop these buildings as social housing and thereby bring those who have been consigned to the outer suburbs back to live in the city again.  All the infrastructure - schools, churches, shops, cinemas and entertainment facilities - is in the city centre, but the people are missing because they have moved out.  I do not know whether this will work.  We would be doing well if six out of every ten policies we pursue worked.  We have to keep trying.  We cannot sit back and let the place fall down.<\/p><p>  I have received representations in this regard from interested parties on the north side of Dublin city.  There is an extensive Georgian area around Mountjoy Square.  I know that if I were to extend this proposal to our capital city, it would be rejected in Europe.  I think I will get it across the line in Europe by confining it to Limerick and Waterford on a pilot basis.  We will see.  If it is very successful, obviously it will become a model which can be applied everywhere.  If it fails, there will be no loss of revenue.  There might be some degree of embarrassment for the local Minister, but the Exchequer will not be hurt in any way.  It is worth trying.<\/p><p>  I have discussed the matter with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, who has designated Limerick as the national cultural city for 2014.  If we can get clearance for this in Europe, it will serve as a significant cultural project as well.  I am interested in driving it forward on that basis because I know we would be shot down if we were to go to Europe to seek approval for a regeneration, development or incentive scheme on the sole basis that it will assist the building and development industry.  We would not be allowed to pursue schemes like the old section 23 scheme that involve stuff like capital write-downs.  The EU is very conscious of the long-standing culture of Europe.  It is susceptible to supporting on cultural grounds projects which it would not be susceptible to supporting on other grounds.  There are cultural, social and economic aspects to this proposal.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked how it will work in practice.  I will take him through a couple of examples that have been drawn up by my officials.  If a person buys a derelict house and renovates it into a single residence for himself or herself, he or she will be eligible for the owner-occupier relief.  That is a very small market because houses at the upper end of Newtown Pery in Limerick have three or four storeys over a basement.  They have stairways rather than lifts or anything like that.  As a result of the various incentives that were provided downtown under the section 23 scheme, it might be the case that a marginal business - a small restaurant or something like that - is being conducted in the basement, but it is likely that the upper floors will not have been occupied for a number of years.  It could be laid out as unattractive office accommodation, for example.  We are talking about the kinds of areas in old towns where solicitors and accountants used to have their offices.  They are all gone to new accommodation that was supported by tax relief.  As a result, there is a lack of occupancy in these buildings.  We are trying to get people back into the town.<\/p><p>  I will give a second example.  If a person buys a building, renovates it into one or a number of units and sells them for owner-occupier purposes, each of the new owners will get the tax relief for that part of the purchase price attributable to the refurbishment.  The site cost is excluded.  There is no prohibition on the sale of units for rental purposes.  This does not affect the entitlement of the owner-occupiers of the other units to their relief.  However, no relief is available in respect of the unit which is let.  Once it has been let, that unit can never revert to the owner-occupier in the future.  In other words, absolutely no section 23 arrangements will be permissible.  If somebody decides that a building of four storeys over a basement is suitable for two families in two residential units, with one unit comprising very extensive accommodation in square metre terms on the top two floors and the other unit comprising the first and second floors, only the owner-occupier will get relief.  If the builder who developed it decides to rent one of the units out, that is his business, but he will not get the relief for the unit that is being rented out.  It will have to be strictly owner-occupied.  The purpose of this measure is to get families back living in the city.  I was addled from trying to come up with measures that might influence behaviour.  I do not know whether this will work.  It is certainly receiving a great deal of support from the local authority in the city.<\/p><p>  I will give a third example.  If a person who buys a derelict building renovates the upper floors as a single unit or multiple units and refurbishes the ground and basement floors as retail premises, the residential relief will be available to him or her as already described.  The capital allowances for the commercial element will not be available unless the upper floors have been refurbished and are either owner-occupied or capable of being owner-occupied.  They could be still unsold at that point in time.  However, if any of the residential units are actually rented out at the time that the accelerated capital allowances are claimed for the lower floors, those allowances will not be available.  This is a stricter rule than in previous schemes.  The reason is that the primary focus is to get families back into the city and let the commercial and retail activity follow them.  It is not intended that ground and basement floors will be renovated for retail purposes with upper floors being left derelict.  That answers one of the points the Deputy made.  While the residential units must be owner-occupied, the retail units may be let.  The lessor may be one of the occupants of the residential units or indeed may be somebody else.  Changes to residential occupancy on the upper floors are irrelevant once the entitlement to a capital allowance has been established.<\/p><p>  We are announcing it here and enacting it to give it a legal basis.  The next step will be to undertake an <i>ex ante<\/i> evaluation of whether this meets the economic and social criteria we think it meets.  We will report back to the committee on that.  It will be brought in by means of ministerial order if it passes the European test, with a view to being enacted from 1 January 2014.  I have described the Limerick situation.  While there are not as many buildings that can be described in period architectural terms in Waterford, there are significant old historic and heritage buildings there.  The retail sector is very important in Waterford.  Those who know Waterford city will be aware that it has particular Waterford problems, just as Limerick city has particular Limerick problems.  I would like to get the support of the committee to move on with this.  As I have said, it might not work at all.  I recommend this model on the basis that it is well worth trying.  If it is an outstanding success, it can be used elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600038#OO00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362584400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I would like to make a few comments before I allow Deputy Doherty to speak again.  It is logical that a significant step will have to take place in this context after Limerick city and county councils are merged.  Limerick is probably the best or worst example in this country of what the Minister has described as the doughnut development of a city.  As a result of the development of a number of hypermarkets in exact proximity to the city council area, there has been a significant downturn in retail operations in the city itself.  It is clear from the reports of Retail Excellence Ireland, which is engaged in a major programme to develop town and city centres throughout the country, that Limerick is the worst performer in the country in terms of the decay of the retail sector in the city centre.  The advantage of the approach that is being proposed is that it will have an employment kick because the proportion of employment is far higher in stand-alone retail traders on the high street than in massive hypermarkets.<\/p><p>  I think the Minister has clarified some of the matters that have arisen with regard to this proposal.  He spoke about Georgian characteristics in his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600038#OO00400","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362585000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>The requirement is to refurbish.  It must be noted that all the Georgian houses we are talking about in this pilot project are all listed buildings.  This will be a hard project to get off the ground because of the restrictions that are always placed on listed buildings.  That means that, in the first instance, planning permission will have to be obtained from the local authority before major refurbishment can take place.  The Bill includes provisions whereby the local authorities must grant permission for the works to take place before works can commence.  Then they must provide certification that the cost and standard of these works is acceptable.  There will be an input from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and, I presume, from the Georgian Society, because we had some preliminary contact with it.  If the scheme becomes too restrictive, it will not happen.  What we want is to get people back living in the city and we want them living in buildings that are appropriately refurbished to maintain their architectural integrity.  In my briefing note I said that we would envisage a number of residential units being in one of those large buildings.  Previously, in their heyday, in the first Georgian phase, they operated on an upstairs and downstairs basis but they were all the one residence.<\/p><p>  To put them into two or more residences is obviously a change of use from what they were historically but I think that can be done very tastefully.  It seems that would require the installation of lifts.  Some have lifts installed already because they were operating for a number of years as multi-floor offices with different renters at different floor levels.  Some still have the stairways.  The common factor is that the facades look reasonably well but they are empty and most have no economic or social use at present.  There are exceptions but that is the way with most of them.  This is an attempt to revitalise them.  I am conscious of what the Chairman has said.  The restrictions have to be put in place to protect the architectural integrity of the buildings and, at the same time, they have to be doable.<\/p><p>  If a family pays &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 or &euro;80,000 for one of these buildings which requires serious refurbishment and if the restrictions put on them add a couple of hundred thousand euro to the refurbishment costs, there comes a point where it is not worth doing.  Ultimately, it has to relate to the market.  As one can only get tax write-offs to the maximum of the income tax one pays, there is an automatic cap on what can happen.  It is worth trying.  I am aware that the new local authority intends planning to develop some of the two storey and the three storey Georgian buildings which are in other parts of the city.  It can fulfil that part of the commitment to make it a living city.  There are several storey Georgian buildings uptown around the Crescent and the railway station and from the Crescent to the People's Park where the most demonstrable buildings are located.  There are Georgian terraces elsewhere.  I can see how some of them would work immediately because they are within the compass of somebody who would like to live in the city and would get the tax break.  It would be an attractive thing to do.  What inhibits the uptown end of the project is the very size of the buildings, unless one was able to divide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600039#PP00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362585000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I am not opposed to the rejuvenation of Limerick city or any other city.  It is something I would welcome and encourage and it is something we have proposed in our policy document.  I have listened to the Minister's rationale and I understand one can recoup 100% over a period of ten years in respect of the investment made in a Georgian building.  While a person obviously would need to have that tax liability each year, it is a seriously lucrative scheme for a person who may be thinking of buying a Georgian building.  I assume, given the introduction of the scheme, that the prices of Georgian buildings have already increased in Limerick and Waterford.  Why would they not?  While the incentive is to get people to live in the town, there may be others who live in buildings other than Georgian ones which would probably need the same type of investment.  I understood the Minister to say, however, that he would not get that across the line at European level.  I think the scope of the scheme is too wide and the tax incentives are too much for the individuals.<\/p><p>  While I have no doubt that there is a benefit to the cities, I could take the Minister to towns such as Letterkenny, where the bottom of High Street is dilapidated with old houses which would benefit greatly from such a scheme.  I could also take him to Border communities.  If he is ever in the north west, he should travel through Pettigo on the Border which suffered as a result of the conflict.  It is appalling going through it.  They are very good and proud people in Pettigo but its buildings are old and run down.  I could give the Minister another example that would fit into the scheme.<\/p><p>  The reason I say this is that it is unfair the Minister has chosen Georgian buildings in two cities.  Has the Minister ever visited Tory Island, an area that should get support from the European Union?  It has a number of houses which are run down and closed up.  If we want a vibrant island community why not introduce such a scheme for the islands?  There used to be a scheme but it was closed by the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  My concern is that the scheme applies only to the owners of Georgian buildings or somebody who goes out tomorrow and buys a Georgian building.  There is an issue with the fact the Minister has allowed for the basement and first floor to be developed into a commercial unit, which could disadvantage a person who has a commercial unit in the area and who cannot get the same benefit.  That one can recoup so much of the investment over a ten-year period is too much to start with on a pilot project.  That is my piece on it.  I am still not convinced about this scheme, particularly with regard to its scope.

The retail scheme is the second of these and it applies to areas the local authorities in Waterford and Limerick will designate.  It is not tied to Georgian buildings or exclusively based on Georgian buildings.  It is a scheme that can apply to high streets or back streets or whatever area is designated as part of the regeneration policy for Waterford and Limerick.  This particular scheme is more suited to Waterford at this time than tying it to the rejuvenation of Georgian buildings, as it has significant historic buildings which might date from other periods.<\/p><p>  The second issue concerns the people who want to live in the city and buy a non-Georgian building and do it up.  We envisage significant increased costs for someone who is refurbishing a Georgian building, because of the considerations the Chairman mentioned in this debate.  One might buy a house next door to a Georgian house, which is modern and built on a vacant site where a Georgian building came down, and get planning permission and start work using traditional methods, but the costs are way lower.  However, the cost of the refurbishment of a building under the scheme will be quite restrictive.  That is why I am saying I do not know whether this will work.

In its tenor, I welcome this incentive because it is forward looking and has the potential to create jobs and investment in the regions.<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Naughten, however, I believe there is an issue here in terms of how effective this can be in achieving its objective of encouraging growth in this business.  The current provision, in my view, confers a far greater advantage on any airport with existing facilities and which might be in receipt of rental income.  Such an airport, one could argue, could be in a position to borrow to invest in hangars and other facilities and, in turn, offset capital allowances in full against rental income over seven years.  On the other hand, if one takes an airport such as Ireland West Airport Knock, it would not be in a position to benefit.  Furthermore, the proposition is not so attractive to private investors to any significant degree.  The likes of Knock airport has no rental income and, because of its existing debt burden, is unable to borrow to fund hangar building.  Therefore, it cannot avail of the capital allowances going forward.  The way the particular section of the Bill is drafted and structured means there is no great incentive for private investors to go in either.  There is very little incentive for private investors that an airport like Knock would need to have in order to grow, compete and attract inward investment for this type of business, allowing it to become self-financing in the future.<\/p><p>  My proposal is that the Minister might consider an amendment on Report Stage or during the debate in the Seanad to alter the wording of the Bill to allow that the tax relief or the capital allowances would be made available against other income.  I suggest that unused capital allowances would not be restricted to the tax life of the buildings and should be carried forward until they are used up.  Also, I suggest that capital allowances should not be deemed as a specified relief used by high income individuals.  Finally, I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of introducing double rent relief and a section 23-type scheme whereby the cost of the construction or refurbishment of the qualifying property is given as relief against the rental income of the building.  Knock Airport does not have the wherewithal to build hangars and engage in such capital investment in order to be able to avail of this tax break.  It is not so attractive for private investors either, who we would like to come in.<\/p><p>  Amendments such as these would make it more attractive and I ask the Minister to consider such amendments on Report Stage or in the course of the Seanad debate.  These amendments are key if this section is to have any benefit for the likes of Knock airport, which I am sure is the Minister's intention, given that he said that the incentive will be universally applicable.  However, if in reality certain regional airports cannot avail of the incentive and investors are not interested, then we have a problem and the tax break is not going to mean anything to airports that do not have assets, hangars or rental income to write off.  I ask the Minister to give this further consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600041#RR00500","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1362586200,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The issues have been spelled out well by the two previous speakers.

They have advised that the section would not benefit Ireland West Airport Knock or those seeking to create enterprise there to any significant degree by comparison with other airports.  I refer the Minister back to what we spoke about earlier regarding the IDA, regional development and so forth.  This is one of the areas where there may be a knock-on effect, with unintended consequences that could impact negatively on this particular region.  Ireland West Airport Knock is not just a Mayo airport.  A young girl from my part of the country is going there next week to fly to England to look for a job.  It is the airport that a lot of people use in the west.  It is important that we do not knock Knock airport, if the Minister will pardon the pun, with this legislation.

This is not just speculative because the second biggest aircraft company in Russia has a base in Shannon and is doing exactly that.  The company has acquired an Aer Lingus hangar to do it.  There is a real prospect of the company expanding its business and other airlines using it for refurbishment purposes, provided the company has extra hangars and pads to carry out such refurbishment.  When we examined this, we decided that the whole country has the potential to have a more significant aviation business.  The aircraft leasing business is growing continuously.  Airlines do not buy aircraft anymore, by and large, but lease them.  Approximately 85% of the financing of leasing of aircraft worldwide is here in this city.  There is a multiplicity of financial services companies in this city that specialise in the financing of aircraft leasing.  We have an international name which has been below the radar, if Deputies will excuse the pun.  There is no perception of this, except within the business.  When people talk about leasing aircraft they are told to go to Dublin to finance it.

It also relates to a minimum effective rate of corporation tax.  The Minister has responded in the past to questions on the tax paid by businesses in the State to say that the average effective rate of tax they pay is 11.9%.  That figure is based on a report which examined the company profits.  The report did not examine how companies manage to lower their profits in a legal way to avoid paying the full rate of corporation tax.  I note that the Minister has undertaken to participate in the OECD's base erosion and profit-shifting project which will examine how damaging international tax loopholes, including ones like the double Irish, are to the fairness of the taxation system and taxpayers.<\/p><p>  I have requested on a number of occasions information from some of the top businesses in the State on their turnover, profits and the tax they pay, but it has not been forthcoming.  I urge the Minister to examine the role the Irish system plays in transfer pricing and other provisions.  We want the Minister to examine how it affects small and medium enterprises and to analyse how the Finance Bill impacts on effective tax rates for companies.  While I understand that the effective tax rate is based on profits and do not contest that companies pay 11.9% on that, we all know that arrangements have been put in place by the State and others which allow companies legally to transfer profits out of the State in ways that are very lucrative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600043#UU00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362587700,"counter":639,"content":"<p>This issue has been raised a number of times by way of parliamentary question.

The Irish package has been particularly successful for a variety of reasons which will be familiar to the Deputy.  One aspect is that our corporation tax rate is 12.5% but there are other issues.  For example, an American company coming to Europe will probably see advantages in having an English-speaking base for its European headquarters.  That reduces the choice to ourselves and the United Kingdom.  Traditionally, the United Kingdom did not need to offer incentives to attract direct investment into the UK.  For example, they had car assembly business from Japan and various other business.  The UK is becoming more competitive now and it is reducing its rate of corporation tax.  The Chancellor has committed to getting the rate down to 18% or 19% in the next couple of years.  They are certainly moving towards a percentage rate in the high teens.  The margin is not as great as it was.  The UK also has a treatment of patents called the Patent Box, which we are studying.  This measure is quite competitive and probably attractive for certain types of companies.  Holland has a well-developed package of incentives.  Other countries, which in the past have not paid as much attention, are unhappy with the fact that some countries have incentives.  Countries such as Holland, the UK - which is moving into that space - and ourselves, are entirely within our rights because it is a matter for the treaties.  It is a sovereign right to set one's rates of tax, whether that is income tax or corporation tax.  There are EU restrictions on VAT rates and the categorising of VAT but we are completely within our rights with regard to corporation tax rates.<\/p><p>  The study to which Deputy Doherty referred was commissioned by the previous Government when we were under a lot of pressure from France at European level about our 12.5% tax rate.  The study was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers with the World Bank.  They studied nominal rates and effective rates of tax.  On that basis, our 12.5% nominal rate had an effective rate of 11.9%.  That is the basis for that figure.  At a rate of 11.9% our nominal rate was the lowest or very low across OECD countries.  Cyprus might have been 10%.  Our effective rate was mid-table.  I think we are at about 13 of the 27 eurozone countries.  We are not out of line on our rate.<\/p><p>  The next debate is about the base and this matter is currently before the Commission.  This is the project referenced as CCCTB, common consolidated corporate tax base.  We need to watch this very carefully.  We have a small enough home market and we produce a lot more than we consume ourselves because of our small population.  If the rules of taxation changed so that the tax was applied in the jurisdiction in which the profit was made rather than in the jurisdiction where the product was made or where the wealth was created, a lot of bigger countries competing with us will want to move into that space.<\/p><p>  I am not referring to any company in particular when I give the following example.  A washing machine which is manufactured in Dublin is sold in Paris with a 60% add-on by the time it is being retailed.  At present, the full profit on that piece of manufactured goods would go to the Irish Exchequer.  If the base were to change and the profit were to be applied to where the profit accrued, then the situation would be different.  That would put us in a very bad space.  Everyone is in competition.  We want very transparent schemes which we can stand over but neither will we be played for fools, where what would normally be accredited to the sovereign Exchequer of the country where a product is developed, would be applied to the point of sale.  Value added tax, VAT, is already charged at the point of sale.  In this example, the French Exchequer in Paris would take quite a significant amount of tax from the sale of that same washing machine.  Why revisit a second time and put in something that comes very analogous to VAT as a base corporation profits tax?  Whatever about manufactured goods, it becomes even more complicated with regard to services.  Our recent exports show we are very strong on the services side which is increasing more rapidly than the manufactured goods side.  We are still strong on manufactured goods but the services side is very strong and is in double digits.<\/p><p>  I refer to our tourism industry as an example.  If a person in London books the Merrion Hotel for a week for a family, the bill may be &euro;5,000.  However, if the booking is made over the Internet from London, where did the wealth arise on the service?  The service was provided by the Merrion Hotel but the booking was made on a website on the Internet.  How would the base tax be applied in that case?  There are many tricky areas.  Another example would be an Irish IT company funded by advertising, by and large.  When someone in Berlin accesses the search engine, is it at that point that the profit accrues because they read the adverts which have been put on the site?  It is very tricky.  We need to be careful where we tread because there are people in whose interests it is to change the rules entirely.  However, it is not in our interest to change them.<\/p><p>  In our role as EU Presidency, we have offered to debate the CCCTB fully.  We regard that as our function as the Presidency.  However, there is no enthusiasm for a debate in May or June because there are nearly as many views as there are countries.  Nobody is ready for a debate yet.  I do not think we are at the point of risk.  However, we need to be cautious when debating these issues that we do not make stones for our competitors to throw at us.  I am not referring to Deputy Doherty in this regard or to anyone else.  As a general point, we could be quite genuine in our debate and get into a position where it will be hurled back at us with a twist, that we are running a tax haven.  We are not running a tax haven.  We are very transparent in our taxes.  I will read the briefing note at this point and we might have a further conversation about it then.<\/p><p>  In a number of answers to parliamentary questions and representations on this issue I have repeatedly advised that there is no agreed international methodology for calculating the effective rate of corporation tax.  The international context is very important in the area of corporation tax in Ireland, as we have used our competitive corporation tax regime to attract investment from abroad since the 1950s.  In the absence of an agreed methodology it is not possible to compile a report like the Deputy has suggested nor would it be possible to introduce a minimum effective rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600044#VV00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362588300,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

We voted in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions to show our support in respect of that matter.  It is interesting that the Minister referred to a conversation in which he was involved.  I was informed about a conversation which took place in respect of the multinational sector recently and in which it was stated that the 12.5% rate is not the issue but rather the focus is on how companies can reduce their profits in the State in order to pay a lesser rate.  While we may not be to blame for it, the fact is that profit shifting is taking place on a global scale and among companies located in Ireland.  The latter are entitled to engage in such profit shifting under the structures which currently exist.<\/p><p>  The OECD report refers to an action plan and to legal mechanisms which could be put in place to address the concerns which have arisen.  I have no desire to go off on a tangent but I am genuinely of the view that there is a need for a proper discussion on this matter.  Regardless of whether we like it, the reality is that, as the Minister indicated, people in particular forums, groups and think-tanks - and also those in committees of other parliaments across the globe - are discussing Ireland's corporation tax rate.  Although it pops up every so often, that rate is not the issue.  The real issue is the profit shifting that is being engaged in by companies in Ireland.  Companies from other jurisdictions which are located here are using Ireland and other countries to write down their profits and then pay low corporation tax on them.<\/p><p>  While the discussions to which I refer are taking place, the Members of this Parliament in general have basically stuck their heads in the sand.  If it is the case that we have a transparent, open and acceptable low corporation tax regime - and as the Minister stated, we make no apologies for it - we should engage in an informed discussion in respect of it.  I do not have before me the material which would allow me to state that Ireland is no different from other countries.  It is important that this committee be facilitated in respect of this matter.  It should be ourselves rather than politicians in London, America or Australia who should be discussing what is happening with Ireland's taxation regime.  The fact is that neither the Parliament nor this committee have discussed this matter.  The Minister has stated on previous occasions that such a discussion could be held with the committee.

It is absolutely right that there should be a review of it.  I do not agree with Deputy Michael McGrath's view that we should be cautious about this.  We need to uncover what exactly is going on with the corporation tax rate in this country.  As I have made clear to the Minister in numerous questions I have put forward and as I have made clear to his officials during some informal discussions, I am baffled as to how, on the basis of the latest available figures, we can go from having &euro;70 billion of pretax profits to &euro;4 billion in actual tax paid and claim that we have a 12.5% rate or, as the Minister has done in responses to my queries in this regard, maintain a claim that the effective rate is 11.9% when basic arithmetic would tell us that &euro;4.2 billion as a percentage of &euro;70 billion is about 6.2%.  This is further confirmed, as I posed in a question last week, by EUROSTAT figures comprising detailed figures on tax throughout the European Union, to which I would draw the attention of everybody, particularly the Department.  EUROSTAT refers to what it calls the implicit tax rate.  &quot;Implicit&quot; is its word for effective tax rate.  It is calculated on the same principle, namely, what are the pretax profits, what is tax paid and what is the latter as a proportion of the former.  It has a 6.8% implicit rate for us, as it set out in the figures I have to hand, and not 11.9%.<\/p><p>  It is extraordinary that the response I got to a question I put forward is that we cannot calculate the effective rate.  I ask the Minister what sort of answer is that.  We can calculate the effective rate for everybody else and hammer them with taxes, charges and all the rest of it but it appears we cannot get a straight answer on what is the effective rate, even though the evidence is staring us in the face that the effective rate is half of what the Minister claims it is and figures from EUROSTAT, which is not a left-wing think-tank as far as I am aware, suggests that it is much lower.  It is interesting to note the various figures and our rate compared with that in other countries.  I do not have all the figures to hand but Sweden has an effective rate of 21%, 22% or even higher, Britain has an effective rate of 24% or 26%, and Germany has implicit or effective rate of 17.1% according to the EUROSTAT figures.  By whatever way we define it, our effective rate is a fraction of what is being charged in the rest of Europe.  <\/p><p>  There is no evidence whatsoever to sustain the argument that a low corporate tax rate is central to our economic prosperity, success and to our encouraging investment into the country.  The argument is repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i> as a mantra even though it has had no effect.  We have maintained this low corporate tax rate in good times and in bad and held it as being sacrosanct, something that cannot be touched.  It did not stop us getting a property bubble, it did not stop the crash and in the following five years it has not helped us to recover.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste repeat on a radio programme that our policies are about facilitating investment.  Where is the investment?  In reality, the investment has collapsed and there has been no recovery of that investment as a result of us protecting the corporate tax rate.  If one was to do a fair study of what is going on in the rest of Europe, one would find that the pattern, probably with the exception of the Netherlands which has a low implicit rate like we have, is that the countries that have fared best and proven to be most robust and most resilient in the face of the current downturn have been those that happen to have considerably higher effective tax rates than we do.  They have not suffered a collapse in investment, employment or growth.  There is simply no evidence to sustain the claim that a low corporate tax rate is the key to anything and certainly not the key to their economic prosperity.<\/p><p>  The argument put forward is that by varying or touching the rate, and Deputy McGrath seems to suggest we should even be careful about talking about it, which I find astonishing, and that seems to be the Government view as well-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600046#XX00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":647,"content":"<p>No-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600046#XX00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":648,"content":"<p>The Deputy more or less said that in saying that we should be careful about producing papers on it.  Let us take it that the gap in the rates between us and comparable countries in Europe, indeed the majority of countries in Europe, including Britain with an effective rate of 24% or 26%, is as is suggested in the EUROSTAT figures.  Britain is our nearest neighbour and probably our biggest competitor for US foreign direct investment as an English speaking country within the European Union.  The idea that if we varied our effective rate by a few points there would be a massive migration to Britain of the investment currently coming to this country cannot be sustained because the gap in the rates between us and them would still be very considerable.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Minister does not agree with that and clearly Fianna F&aacute;il does not agree with it, but it does bear a proper analysis.  Let us have scrutiny of this and let us get behind these companies' amazing allowances that see their tax liability written down to the extent that it is.  Let us at least get to a point where we can agree on the effective rate.  The figure the Minister quoted in his response to the question I asked on this, as one calculation of the effective rate at 11.9%, was introduced by the Adam Smith Institute.  That is from where that figure came.  The Adam Smith Institute has a particular bias in this regard because it does like high corporate tax rates.  Of course, it will say effective rates are very high but EUROSTAT has indicated that our rate is half of the rate quoted.  Let us have a serious analysis and debate on what is the effective rate and what would be the impact, extra revenue generated and overall effect on the economy of raising the rate.  Then we can have an informed debate, but let us end the situation where corporate tax is a sacred that we cannot touch when everybody else is being hammered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600046#XX00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":649,"content":"<p>That is all very interesting.

This is necessary to ensure the section will operate as intended.  The purpose of the section is to enhance the three year tax relief for start-up companies.  This was announced in budget 2013 as part of the package of measures to support small businesses.  The section is being revised primarily to cement the link between the relief and employment by ensuring the amount of relief in any year does not exceed a company's total employer's PRSI contribution and also to make it simpler and easier to operate as intended in the budget provision.  The section, as amended, provides for a significant enhancement of the three year tax relief for start-up companies.  The purpose of the relief is to facilitate new business ventures and promote job creation.  At present, the relief operates on a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; basis.  Relief is not available if a company incurs a loss or does not have a sufficient amount of profits and tax payable in any of the first three years of trading to absorb the employer's PRSI contributions.  <\/p><p>  The purpose of the section is to increase the flexibility of the scheme.  The relief is being extended to allow unused relief arising in the first three years of trading due to losses or insufficient profits to be carried forward for use in subsequent years indefinitely.  This effectively creates a bucket of credits which can be carried forward for use in each subsequent year until such conditions arise where they can be utilised.  To ensure the company availing of the relief maintains its commitment to employment, the amount of relief is restricted by reference to the total employer's PRSI contribution for each year in respect of the company's employees.  This change will provide for further assistance for new start-up businesses, many of which do not make profits in their early years.  Allowing unused relief to be carried forward to later years when they become profitable is a significant enhancement of existing relief.  <\/p><p>  To put it very simply, the original section 33 which was published in the Finance Bill did not accurately put into effect the intention of the budget announcement; therefore, we went back for a redraft which is now before the committee by way of an amendment.  It does not add to or subtract anything from the scheme as originally announced; therefore, there is nothing new in substance included and nothing is being subtracted.  It is simply the case that on examination, the original draft was flawed and this is a draft that accurately delivers on the intention of the measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600048#ZZ01500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590100,"counter":667,"content":"<p>It makes sense to provide start-up tax reliefs.  I have no problem with this, but I do have an issue with their being carried forward indefinitely.  If a company availing of these tax reliefs is not able to utilise them within the period of three years, they can be carried forward indefinitely.  Where a company commences operations, it can still avail of start-up relief six or seven years down the road.  If a company is able to survive and remain viable for that length of time, it is no longer a start-up company and does not need the crutch of start-up reliefs.  I am concerned by the fact that they can be carried forward indefinitely and think the Minister should set a timeframe.  There comes a point when a business is no longer a start-up but an established company.

One thing to consider might be the profitability of a company.  Restricting the tax relief to a small enterprise which is making a small profit could make the difference between that enterprise employing a further person or not.

As the purpose of the relief is to create jobs in small and medium enterprises, to introduce uncertainty as to the ongoing availability of the relief after a close-out date would make companies reluctant to take on another person at the end of the scheme.  To provide certainty to new companies that they will benefit from the relief on becoming profitable should positively influence their decisions to take on extra staff in the interim.  Another job or two will be created in a company as it knows the relief will continue to apply until it is profitable.  It is small money but around the edges small money can make a big difference.

Under the new budget rules coming down the line in Europe, there will be a formalisation of the policy the Deputy suggests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600049#AAA01400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 45:<blockquote><br \/>In page 81, before section 38, to insert the following new section:38.&mdash;(1) The Principal Act is amended in section 730F&mdash;<br \/>'(<i>a<\/i>) in subsection (1) by substituting &quot;Subject to subsection (1B), in this section&quot; for &quot;In this section&quot;, and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) by inserting the following after subsection (1A):<blockquote>&quot;(1B) Where the policyholder is a company&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the rate specified in subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>)(i) shall not apply unless the policyholder has made the declaration referred to in paragraph (<i>b<\/i>), and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the rate specified in subsection (1)(<i>a<\/i>)(ii) shall apply unless immediately before the chargeable event, the life assurance company is in possession of a declaration from the policyholder to the effect that the policyholder is a company and which includes the company's tax reference number (within the meaning of section 891B(1)).&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(2) The Principal Act is amended in section 739D&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) in subsection (5A) by substituting &quot;Subject to subsection (5AA), the amount&quot; for &quot;The amount&quot;, and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) by inserting the following after subsection (5A):<blockquote>&quot;(5AA) Where the unit holder is a company&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the formula specified in subsection (5A)(<i>a<\/i>) shall not apply unless the unit holder has made the declaration referred to in paragraph (<i>b<\/i>), and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the formula specified in subsection (5A)(<i>b<\/i>) shall apply unless immediately before the chargeable event, the investment undertaking is in possession of a declaration from the unit holder to the effect that the unit holder is a company and which includes the company's tax reference number (within the meaning of section 891B(1)).&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(3) The Principal Act is amended in section 739E&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) in subsection (1) by substituting &quot;Subject to subsection (1B), in this section&quot; for &quot;In this section&quot;, and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) by inserting the following after subsection (1A):<blockquote>&quot;(1B) Where the unit holder is a company&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the rate specified in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>)(i) or paragraph (<i>b<\/i>)(i), as the case may be, of subsection (1) shall not apply unless the unit holder has made the declaration referred to in paragraph (<i>b<\/i>), and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the rate specified in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>)(ii) or paragraph (<i>b<\/i>)(ii), as the case may be, of subsection (1) shall apply unless immediately before the chargeable event, the investment undertaking is in possession of a declaration from the unit holder to the effect that the unit holder is a company and which includes the company's tax reference number (within the meaning of section 891B(1)).&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This section places a requirement on a company that invests in either a life insurance policy or in units in an investment trust to make a written declaration to the policy provider or to the investment undertaking to the effect that the investor is a corporate investor.

The introduction of a wholly new tax regime to legislation is a significant undertaking and as is normal several issues have come to light since the publication of the Bill as initiated.  The majority of these amendments are wholly technical in nature and are required to give clarity to certain definitions or to ensure that the wording used in the provisions is consistent with other relevant provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act.<\/p><p>  I am also proposing two more substantive amendments, Nos. 51 and 53 to strengthen further the investor protection aspects of the REITs regime.  I propose introducing a good acid test to make sure that a minimum of 75% of the REITs assets are assets of the property rental business and a debt equity ratio to limit borrowings with a REIT to 50% of the value of its assets.  These changes are prompted by a further review of comparative provisions in REIT regimes worldwide and also by investor protection concerns raised by Deputies on Second Stage.<\/p><p>  I will now speak about the details of this group of amendments.  These five amendments are being taken together as they are interlinked and all relate to technical amendments which are to be made for the purposes of clarity and to ensure that the provisions operate as intended.  The REITs legislation as initiated includes definitions of aggregate income and property income which specify how certain amounts of income net of capital gains are to be calculated.  In order to be technically correct it was determined that these definitions should also take account of capital losses.  Accordingly, to provide for this clarification I am putting forward for the consideration of the committee the following amendments, No. 46 to amend the definition of aggregate income to include references to the newly defined aggregate net losses, No. 47 to insert a definition of aggregate net losses, No.48 to amend the definition of property income to include reference to the newly defined property net losses, No.50 to insert a definition of property net losses.  A further technical correction is being made in amendment No. 49 which corrects a typographical omission to be consistent with the wording used in other related definitions where the revaluation or disposal of investment property is referenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 47:<blockquote><br \/>In page 83, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:<br \/>&quot; 'aggregate net losses', in relation to a company or group, means the amount by which the sum of the losses recognised in arriving at the aggregate profits of the company or group, as the case may be, being losses which arise on the revaluation or disposal of investment property or other non-current assets, exceeds the sum of the gains so recognised, being gains which arise on such revaluation or disposal;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB00900","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<blockquote><br \/>In page 84, to delete lines 35 to 39 and substitute the following:<br \/>&quot; 'property income', in relation to a company or group, means the property profits of the company or group, as the case may be, as&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) reduced by the property net gains of the company or group, as the case may be, where property net gains arise, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) increased by the property net losses of the company or group, as the case may be, where property net losses arise;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB01100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49:<blockquote><br \/>In page 84, line 49, after &quot;on&quot; to insert &quot;the&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB01300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50:<blockquote><br \/>In page 85, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:<br \/>&quot; 'property net losses', in relation to a company or group, means the amount by which the sum of the losses recognised in arriving at the aggregate profits of the company or group, as the case may be, being losses which arise on the revaluation or disposal of investment property or other non-current assets which are assets of the property rental business, exceeds the sum of the gains so recognised, being gains which arise on such revaluation or disposal;&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB01500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 and 54 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600050#BBB01700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<blockquote><br \/>In page 86, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:<br \/>&quot; 'specified debt' means any debt incurred by a REIT or group REIT in respect of monies borrowed by, or advanced to, the REIT or group REIT, as the case may be;&quot;.<\/blockquote>These three amendments are interlinked.  They have been proposed in order to provide additional protection for investors in Irish REITs.

The REIT model already includes a profit financing test to limit the amount of interest on borrowings a REIT can have by reference to its rental profits.<\/p><p>  Concerns were raised by REITs professionals that this limit may still allow scope for significant borrowings within a REIT and it was proposed that a debt equity provision be introduced to protect investors.  Accordingly, I am putting forward for consideration the following amendments:  Amendment No. 51 provides for the insertion of a definition of specified debt in order to allow for the introduction of a debt equity limitation which will apply to Irish REITs.  Amendment No. 53 then introduces a provision limiting the amount of specified debt within a REIT to 50% of the market value of the assets of the REIT.  Amendment No. 53 also introduces a second new investor protection feature to REIT legislation, a good asset test.  This feature is being added following a review of other REIT regimes worldwide and also following suggestions made by Deputies on Second Stage.  The good asset test will require that a minimum of 75% of the assets of a REIT must be assets of the property rental business of the REIT.

If a REIT can operate at 10% retention of profits, a greater distribution of dividend makes it more enticing for people to invest.<\/p><p>  With regard to the three-year grace period to comply with technical accounting requirements, we have a massive distressed property market.  A year and a half ago, NAMA was presented with options for establishing REITs.  The options had merit and NAMA indicated it would go with them.  There is great potential for REITs in the country but a three-year grace period not to comply with accounting requirements is a lengthy period of time.  I argue we should reduce that to a more limited timeframe.  The other issue the Minister should examine concerns his suggestion that only 85% of profits are distributed to investors through dividends and, in the case of United States, the 15% retained is subject to corporation tax.  We are not applying any tax to the profit retained by the REIT.  I argue that we should apply corporation tax to the profit.  A REIT is a company and an investment vehicle and that portion has not been transferred to shareholders.  Corporation tax should apply and it is my understanding that it applies in the US, where REITs are well-established since the 1940s.  Has the Minister considered this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12013030600052#DDD02500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1362592500,"counter":749,"content":"<p>In the hands of the investors, REITs are treated the same way as rental income.

I would have a high regard for the issue of investor protection.  Following an assessment of Deputy Doherty's amendments, I have proposed two specific amendments to section 39 in order to provide additional protection for investors in Irish REITs.  Specifically I have proposed the introduction of a debt-equity ratio, limiting the borrowings of a REIT to a maximum of 50% of the value of the assets of the REIT and the introduction of a good asset test whereby a minimum of 75% of REIT assets must be assets of the property rental business.  The general concerns in relation to investor protection, as outlined by Deputy Doherty during his Second Stage contributions, were taken into account when drafting the proposed amendments in my name.  We have pretty much close agreement on that.<\/p><p>  In respect of the differential between taxing the REIT and the interest issue, private investors are not limited in the amounts they can borrow, as there is no legal limitation on the amount they can borrow.  However, there is a legal limitation of 50% being imposed on the REITs.  It is not an equal situation.  We felt we were justified in not imposing the 75% interest rate restriction.<\/p><p>  I have dealt with the issue of Irish investors.<\/p><p>  On the question of corporation tax on the residue held by the REITs, since it is a property company, there will be expenses in maintaining and upgrading properties and in securing them and all the normal expenses connected to property, so the intention is that the residue in the REITs company would be used for that purpose.

Mr. Browder has been seeking support from governments and parliaments on sanctions relating to travel and assets involving individuals implicated in the death of Mr. Magnitsky.<\/p><p>  A motion relating to the case has been tabled by Senators Walsh, Daly, Norris and Mullins and Deputies O'Sullivan, Byrne and Smith.

Those of us who were on the OSCE parliamentary assembly would have heard it previously.  People who were here who were also on the Council of Europe would obviously have heard the background to it.  The first draft was circulated to everybody and some suggestions were made to improve it, which I was happy to do.<\/p><p>  The first paragraph of the motion sets out the circumstances that brought about the death of Sergei Magnitsky involving the denial of medical care and the fact that he was moved from one prison to a more secure but less humane one, about which we heard the last day.  The second paragraph deals with the statement of facts with regard to the various bodies that have taken up the case.  The third paragraph deals with our call to the Government to look at introducing a Magnitsky law which would cover the component parts that cropped up in the previous discussion we had and which also was very much part of the US Magnitsky law and involves publicly listing the names, denying relevant parties visas into Ireland and freezing assets found in Ireland.  If the Government is of the mind to go with this issue, it might be done by virtue of a Magnitsky amendment to the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation.  It would seem to fit that area to some extent.<\/p><p>  It also addresses the assets and finances of Russian government officials and others responsible for the arrest and torture of Mr. Magnitsky, and the cover-up that took place subsequently.  A call for an Irish Magnitsky law to be imposed against all other gross human rights violations in Russia was in the first draft but Deputy Byrne made the wise suggestion that this be made a template for dealing with any significant human rights violation which the Government or authorities might be of a mind to pursue so that these people cannot enjoy in other jurisdictions the proceeds of their criminal activities in other jurisdictions.  With the ease of travel and the ease of transferring money today, we are all well aware of the need for co-operation around that.  The motion also calls for the Government to utilise its Presidency of the Council of the EU to seek to extend this circumstance and the legislation surrounding it to other European countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013030600003#E00700","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362580800,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I am one of the signatories of the motion and was provoked into supporting it having heard an impassioned and intelligent presentation by Mr. Browder.  I addressed the motion to the issue of human rights, which is ranked by the committee as a very important aspect of its work.  I was also interested because the matter coincided with events that were happening around another man, Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky.  In Russia, the privatisation of utilities saw all sorts of oligarchs come to prominence.  It is a murky world.  Members will hear me talk about the Ukraine and Tymoshenko.  It is the murky world of privatising natural resources that has her in prison and allegations being made.  A fundamental human rights issue which has been presented to us which is worth listening to and supporting.  I understand that since Mr. Browder was here, he has been charged by the Russian authorities.<\/p><p>  Most people will find it objectionable on human rights issues that people would be tried posthumously.  To prosecute someone after he or she is dead is a rather strange legal process.  I am an eternal democrat and, having had preconceived notions about other countries but then having heard from the Moroccan, Israeli or Pakistani ambassador, I appreciate absolutely that hearing from a country which has to do some explaining can give one a better overview of the issues.  That is why I would be supportive of meeting the Russian ambassador to tease out some of the issues which are international in essence.  The Khodorkovsky case is a significant international issue and the Magnitsky one is big because the Americans have taken it on board.  The Russians are clearly taking great offence at these issues being debated.  We cannot run away from the fact that we must debate them, however, in circumstances in which they have been presented to us as human rights issues.  As human rights issues, we must address them.<\/p><p>  I thank Senator Jim Walsh for producing the motion.  I asked for what I thought was an important amendment to delete the word \"Russia\" because I felt that if a motion like this should be debated, it should be in an attempt to prevent tyrants from anywhere - not just Russian tyrants if they exist - to avail of our hospitality or banking system to transfer ill-gotten gains.  I am happy to debate matter and that the members who have not signed the motion should be afforded the opportunity to examine it greater detail.  I would be very happy that we progress the issue.  Mr. Browder was with Ms Anne Barrington, the director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs's Europe division, and I would like to hear her view of the lobbying that went on and her view on behalf of Ireland Inc. as to how it feels on the issue.<\/p><p>  As he mentioned the OSCE, the PA and all of these other politicians throughout the world who were supporting the motion, I asked Mr. Browder but he did not confirm that any country other than the USA had adopted legislation.  We must be honest with everyone around the table and those who may be watching live that even if we pass a motion, it will take years for the parliamentary legal process to produce a Bill let alone have Europe adopt it.

It is not as if there is a person who is still alive whose life we could save as was the case in respect of Raul Wallenberg.  We must be aware, however, that in this case the family is being victimised in the most unconscionable and disgraceful fashion.  I am not sure what the degree of urgency is but imagine a delay of a week or two in the committee in passing the motion may not be of great significance.<\/p><p>  The language used in the first paragraph of the motion is not particularly diplomatic but the facts recited in the second paragraph may be true.  They are in keeping with Russian practice not just under Mr. Putin who is somebody about whom considerable doubt exists, but also under the regime from which he sprang, the Soviet Union, and beyond to the practices of the Tsarist regime.  It is not unthinkable that this should have happened.  The motions calls for the publishing of names, the denial of visas to travel to Ireland and the freezing of assets.  We should bring in such measures.  I am delighted that the motion should extend to other countries but that is where we will have a difficulty.  I doubt very much that any of these boyos have assets here or want to visit Ireland.  I smiled inwardly when I heard that they might be leaping over themselves to get into our banks.  They are welcome to as far as I am concerned since none of the Irish people got much good out of the blackguards.  I do not think these people are likely to visit Ireland.<\/p><p>  It is a very good suggestion of Deputy Eric Byrne's to delete the word \"Russia\" to extend the motion to all countries.  It is very idealistic, however.  I would love if Ireland was in the vanguard in having an ethical foreign policy as attempted by Mr. Robin Cook, before he was taken asunder, and I regret and deplore that it is not the case.

As the Ministers stated on that day, were we to design a solution to meet the mobility and transport needs of people with physical, sensory, intellectual and mental health disabilities today, it is extremely unlikely that we would establish schemes of this type.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman recommended that the Department of Health revise both schemes to make them compliant with the Equal Status Acts by removing the age limit and using a broader definition of disability in respect of eligibility for both schemes.  It has proven extremely difficult to resolve this matter.  Several policy options have been considered in detail.  These have raised significant issues, including the feasibility of extending eligibility under the schemes.<\/p><p>  As was outlined at the previous hearing before the joint committee, the best data available to the Department indicate that the cost of such an extension could be as much as &euro;100 million per annum in the case of mobility allowance and &euro;200 million over a three year period in the case of the motorised transport grant.  In that context, the Department considered the possible expansion of the eligibility criteria within the current budget of &euro;10.6 million.  However, given the number of people who would then be eligible, the resultant payments would be so reduced as to make them almost meaningless.  The Government came to the conclusion that an extension of either scheme would create serious financial pressure on the health budget in the current climate and be unsustainable.<\/p><p>  It is important also to emphasise that the Department of Health accepts the position taken by the Ombudsman on this matter.  Her position on how these schemes have been operated is clear.  I acknowledge the inequalities in the schemes as they have operated.  I acknowledge the fact that schemes under the auspices of the Department must comply with the Equal Status Acts.  I also acknowledge that it would have been preferable if these issues had been addressed before now.  However, I must also acknowledge that the possible additional costs - direct and indirect - of expanding the eligibility criteria for the schemes are completely unaffordable without very significant additional funding, which is not available, or by cutting already scarce health and personal social services to people with disabilities, older people and those with mental health difficulties.  Clearly, that is not an action we were prepared to take.<\/p><p>  I assure the committee that the Department has made many efforts to resolve the difficulties without imposing undue hardship on those who have been reliant on the supports.  This has been at the centre of the Department&rsquo;s efforts to find a solution which would be financially affordable and legally sound.  However, despite these efforts, the risks to the State as identified by very strong legal advice were too great.  The Government, therefore, reluctantly made the decision to close the schemes to further applications with effect from close of business on 26 February last.<\/p><p>  It is important to outline for the information of the committee the full details of the Government&rsquo;s decision.  The mobility allowance and motorised transport grant have been closed to any further applications with effect from close of business on the day of the Government&rsquo;s decision.  The mobility allowance will continue to be paid for a further four months in respect of those already in receipt or those whose application has already been received and who are found to qualify.  The motorised transport grant will also be paid to those whose applications have already been received and who are found to qualify.  No further applications will be accepted for either scheme.  At present, up to 4,700 people are in receipt of a mobility allowance payment and will continue to be until the four month period has elapsed.  A total of 300 people each year had been in receipt of a motorised transport grant up to the date of closure of the scheme.<\/p><p>  The Minister and the Minister of State have instructed the Department of Health to lead a review of the issues and to seek a solution or solutions as to how best to meet the mobility and transport needs of all those who require support, within the budget available.  A review group has now been established for that purpose and met for the first time on Thursday, 21 February.  Both the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, attended the meeting and outlined the complexities of the issues now faced.  The group is independently chaired by Ms Sylda Langford and includes representatives of people with disabilities, relevant Departments and State agencies, including the HSE and the National Disability Authority.  The membership includes those who can best assist in designing a solution, and additional input will be sought from others if required.  The group is meeting again tomorrow afternoon.<\/p><p>  It has been agreed that the group will work in a number of stages, commencing as a priority, led by the Department of Health, with a review of the issues around the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant and devising an appropriate solution.  Once this first phase has been completed, the group will continue its work under the leadership of the most appropriate Department to examine wider issues around transport for persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>  As part of the initial stage of the review, the Health Service Executive will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the HSE has been instructed to contact each individual who has been in receipt of the payments to notify him or her of the Government&rsquo;s decision and the actions now being taken.<\/p><p>  I assure the committee that the closure of the schemes is not an action the Government wanted to take and the decision was not taken lightly.  The Government considered every possible configuration to keep the schemes in payment.  This included an option of allowing those in receipt of the mobility allowance to retain it on a more permanent basis and to close the scheme to new entrants.  However, the Government was advised that this would be legally unsound.  We asked if the scheme could be redesigned.  Again, the advice was that this would be legally unsound, in particular as regards the very broad definition of disability in the Equal Status Acts.  It would not be possible to state that only one category of people with disabilities could continue to receive the allowance while others who are included under the definition of disability in the Equal Status Acts could not.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health, the Minister, Minister of State and the Government are aware of the significant concerns the closure of the schemes has brought.  It is in that context that the Department has been active in seeking a solution to this issue which would avoid the necessity for such a decision.  As I have stated, attempts have been made for some time to resolve the issues around the schemes.  Advice has been sought on a number of options to address the difficulties, all of which have been found to be legally unsound or financially unaffordable.<\/p><p>  It is important that I outline for the committee the consultations which have taken place since I last appeared before it on 6 February.  Department of Health officials met representatives of the Disability Federation of Ireland, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the Irish Wheelchair Association following the committee meeting and outlined to them the considerable legal and financial difficulties around the schemes.  At the meetings, the input of those organisations was sought to help find a solution or solutions within the available funding.<\/p><p>  Together with officials, I met the national council of the Disability Federation of Ireland on Wednesday, 27 February.  The closure of the schemes was one of a number of issues discussed.  Broader consultation will be undertaken as part of the project group&rsquo;s work to ensure as wide a range as possible of views and inputs are taken into account.  In seeking a solution which will address the transport and mobility needs of those who require supports, the Department is concerned about the group of people who are currently benefitting under the schemes.  We must also equally consider, however, the broader group whose needs the Ombudsman has recommended must be looked after on an equitable basis.<\/p><p>  The challenge is to find a solution which will best meet these needs within the budget available.  However, it must be emphasised that as the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, have all stated, the funding of &euro;10.6 million currently allocated to the schemes will be reinvested in its entirety in the solution or solutions which will be identified by the group.  The Government&rsquo;s decision commits that this allocation will remain in place to service priority mobility and transport supports for those most in need.  The review group will therefore seek solutions which can be delivered within the available funding.<\/p><p>  I assure the members of the committee that if the Department could have found an easy solution to this problem, we would have found it.  We must comply with the Equal Status Act; that is clear.  A fundamental truth is that it was not possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they had operated, given the significant financial risks to the State.  The only way we can address this is to devise a transport solution that will best serve those with priority needs in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600004#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362586500,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank the Secretary General for coming at such short notice.

The motorised transport grant has no age limit while the mobility allowance has an age limit.  I gave a caveat when promising these figures for the committee that we would do the best we could with the available information.  The census profile in 2011 gave a total of 542,277 people aged 15 and over with a disability, and of these, 112,502 were at work - just over 20%.  Allowing for 50% eligibility, which is the average industrial wage cut off, with a motorised transport grant of &euro;5,000 per annum every three years, we worked out a cost of &euro;200 million over three years.<\/p><p>  For the mobility allowance, we used the national disability survey and according to that, upwards of 59,000 people over 65 years of age had a lot of difficulty in walking for 50 minutes or could not do it at all.  All of those people could be eligible for mobility allowance.  We figured that while those failing the means test could reduce the number of people over 65, should the definition of disability be expanded to include those with a disability other than a mobility difficulty, the number of eligible people could increase further.

This allows people to operate at some level as autonomous individuals with self-determination.

While I did not participate in the discussions during previous meetings, it is clear that many issues arise.  I am conscious that this issue predates the current Administration and that we are working in extraordinarily tight economic times.  It could be argued, however, that the Department of Health has been careless because other issues have arisen with regard to nursing home subventions and long-stay charges for medical card holders.  Now we have the decision to abolish the mobility allowance scheme and motorised transport grants.<\/p><p>  I am concerned at the thought processes in evidence in some of the decisions that have been made.  At our previous meeting, the Minister indicated that once it became apparent that the schemes had become a problem on the basis that it was illegal not to extend them, it was considered that they no longer accorded with the Government's mainstreaming policy on disability.  What better example of mainstreaming can one find that providing financial assistance or grant payments to allow people with a disability to adapt a vehicle or pay for taxi or other form of transport in order that they can travel, pay visits and so forth?  This is essentially the definition of mainstreaming. <\/p><p>  I am concerned by the emphasis officials and the Minister have placed on what have been described as \"administrative\" schemes.  Dr. McLoughlin stated the \"motorised transport grant and mobility allowance were established on an administrative basis, in good faith and with the best intentions, in 1968 and 1979, respectively\".  It is almost as if an apology is being made for doing so.  What is the difference between a scheme that is introduced on an administrative basis and other types of schemes?  How many services are provided through schemes that are administrative in nature?<\/p><p>  I am concerned that other bodies and individuals will be deterred from seeking the assistance of the Ombudsman if a Department refuses access to a scheme.  If such a decision is considered unfair or illegal and the Ombudsman agrees with that view, will the Government's response always be to withdraw the service in question on the basis that it cannot afford to extend it to those who should be afforded access to it?  <\/p><p>  I ask the Secretary General, in consulting organisations in the disability sector and individuals with disabilities who depend on these services, to bear in mind the likelihood that the individuals in question will be in receipt of a range of other services that have been savagely cut in the past two years and that their income will, in many cases, have been reduced in the past two years.  Every cut that has been made, whether to administrative or statutory services - if that is the distinction that is being drawn - has a dramatic impact on the quality of people's lives.  If we cannot protect the quality of life for people with disabilities, none of us should be here.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600006#F00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362587100,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I assure Deputy Colreavy that I will take on board the points he makes and I understand his point on the need to ensure we do not cause any further distress to the client groups to which he refers.<\/p><p>  On the administrative versus statutory route, the former is usually the preferred methodology for introducing certain schemes.  Historically, there have been many administrative schemes across the health and social services setting.  The alternative is a statutory scheme.  The difficulty we face is that we have a set of unusual circumstances in that the Ombudsman is correct that the Equal Status Acts must be complied with.  That is the position in which we find ourselves.

I appreciate that the representatives of the Department of Health have attended today but I must put the following question to them.  Did they and the relevant Ministers treat the members and chairman of this committee with utter contempt on the last day they attended to give evidence?  At that stage did they not know this option was one they were considering seriously?  I listened very carefully to what they said.  However, I have been reliably informed since this came to light that on that day, the decision was being taken in conjunction with the Department and our Ministers, and the Department officials were actively considering the discontinuation of both schemes.<\/p><p>  I want the Department officials to tell me I am wrong in making that accusation.

Ministers were in attendance, yet the officials never indicated to us in the slightest fashion that what would happen would be what I call the nuclear button.

We are just ordinary members of this committee, along with our Chairman, and that was a disgraceful way to treat us.  This is not about us but about the people who are receiving the money, or the grant.  It is all about them.  What way were they treated?

Consider the corporate governance structures in many of the bodies.  Brothers of Charity had &euro;167 million for its 2011 budget.  Daughters of Charity had &euro;110 million and Rehab Care had &euro;45 million.  A raft of advocacy groups throughout the country that do not actually provide any service are receiving funding.

In fact, during the mid-2000s the Department was in negotiation to see if there was a way in which the upper age limit could be removed.  However, that would have required additional funding, as we have already outlined, and did not prove possible.  In the context of a general review of schemes that were under the auspices of the Department, the issue was parked while a range of other issues about these schemes were being examined.  That then led to a decision by the Government that the schemes should transfer to another Department, namely, the Department of Social Protection.  Since then, the domiciliary care allowance, for example, has also transferred to that Department.  After that, the Ombudsman was examining individual cases and came to the Department with concerns.  It was at that point that the Department started to consider the real legalities of the issue.  Legal advice was sought and real efforts were made to find a way to address the legalities.  This has been a pattern over a number of years.  The Department has made efforts to address, in particular, the age limit, for a long number of years on the basis of equity.  It is not something that we have ignored, in any shape or form.  We have been trying to resolve this for a long time.  It just has not proven possible, particularly in the context of the financial constraints under which we currently operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600009#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Grainne Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1362588900,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I want to let the first round of questioners finish before returning to Deputies and Senators who may have further queries.

That legislation, of course, was introduced for a very good reason.  However, in some instances, equality is a hard thing to measure.<\/p><p>  I also note that it is not at all unusual to have to impose cut-off points for schemes when there are budgets to be met.  Sometimes the cut-off point refers to age.  I know, for instance, that the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, administered by local authorities, is only available to those over 60 years of age.  We also know that there are other age limits and restrictions applied when we try to cut our cloth to measure.  In the context of such age limits being applied and justifications being given for them, is the Department looking at ways that a justification can be given for the current limit or is it saying that such a limit cannot be envisaged at all under the current scheme?  I say this in the context of the fact that, for example, social welfare payments change as people age.  Is the Department looking at the possibility of putting this on a statutory basis in order to give effect to the general gist of what we want to achieve here?<\/p><p>  This is obviously a very difficult situation.  I welcome the fact that the &euro;10.6 million has been ring-fenced, set aside and will continue to be there to be provide assistance to people who have mobility problems.  However, the fact that the issue has been kicked around as a political football is making people fearful.  They are hearing soundbites to the effect that people with disabilities and mobility issues are being attacked, which is outrageous.  It is scaremongering and making people very fearful.  I understand, from the Department's previous attendance at this committee and from the plans going forward, that there will be a serious effort made to address this situation and also to get this money spent on mobility assistance and not on anything else.  The people who are affected by this need to be assured of that and of the bona fides of the Department and the Minister for Health in their attempts to address this situation.<\/p><p>  It should also be said that some of those to the fore in kicking the political football around were involved in supporting a previous Government which, when the country was awash with money, did not see fit to sort out a problem such as this one.   It is highly reprehensible behaviour.  I do not think in any system of adversarial politics or any democracy that supports true opposition, that this should be the case.  There are many issues that can be argued and that need to be teased out by those in opposition but pumping out untruths and provoking fear in people that they will be sacrificed, when that is not the intention at all and will not be the case, is reprehensible.

The file would indicate that governments since 2009 were aware of the issues.  I suspect the reason people were very slow to take decisions was that at the end of the day we are down to the 4,700 people and 300 people who benefit from the grants.

I also welcomed the opportunity of appearing here previously with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to give the committee a flavour of the challenges and difficulties we face.<\/p><p>  With regard to whether I can give commitments and undertakings, I am not in a position to give absolute guarantees and undertakings.  However, we are determined to do everything we can in this difficult situation to ensure that the needs and interests of the clients we serve are protected.  I assure the committee we will do everything we can to do that in the context of the solution we find.  I am conscious of the fact that there are 4,700 people in receipt of the mobility allowance and that another 300 received the motorised transport grant.  I am very concerned to assure them and the agencies that work with them that we will work in true partnership to find a solution to this issue.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee members for their comments and suggestions.  They have been very helpful and we will be very happy to take on board many of their recommendations.  I also thank you, Chairman, for the courtesy you have shown to me and my officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600011#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590100,"counter":916,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We live in an Ireland where we have more compassion, empathy, insight and heart.\"<\/p><p>  According to Government figures, some 4,000 people with disabilities live in institutions.  The Government knows that this is wrong.  Government policy is to move away from segregating people with disabilities from the rest of society by facilitating inclusion.  The personal assistant service, housing adaption grants, the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant are key supports in the realisation of the inclusion of people with disabilities in the community.  These supports can be the difference between living and existing.  Not only does the axing of the allowance and grant go against domestic and international policy on accommodating the inclusion of people with disabilities in society, but it is morally wrong.<\/p><p>  I will hand over to the CEO, Mr. Lee.

Mr. McCabe has asked me to go through the CIL presentation.<\/p><p>  The CIL was established in Ireland 21 years ago by people with disabilities.  Today, it is still governed by people with disabilities for people with disabilities.  The CIL's motto is &quot;Nothing about us, without us&quot;.  In other words, people with disabilities should have a say in decisions that affect people with disabilities.  They should be consulted at all times and be centre stage in terms of taking decisions that will affect their lives.  There are 19 centres for independent living throughout the State, involving 7,000 people with disabilities.<blockquote>However, while a person's home offers safety, warmth and a good environment to live in, it cannot be and should not be the person's complete world.  Our lives and family lives are not solely determined by our home<b>. <\/b> Independence and inclusion in our own community is a measure of a fully engaged life for people with disability, as it is for everybody.<\/blockquote>We could have written this, but we did not.  This is a direct quotation from a report published in June 2011, entitled Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion.  This HSE report was done by the working group on congregated settings.<\/p><p>  The HSE is talking the talk on the one hand and, on the other, it is doing what it is doing.  Statements in major reports like this one are great, but what happens on the ground?  The very services that enable inclusion and independence are not being expanded to meet needs that have already been assessed and to tackle waiting lists.  Instead, existing services that people with disabilities depend upon to enable them to be active participants in the community are being cut.<\/p><p>  We have heard that, due to complex legal issues, Departments have been considering their position in recent years.  We cannot understand how the decision was made or why it was announced when it was on a Tuesday evening the week before last.  I have discussed this matter with many of the people who are directly affected.  Many of our members are upset and frightened.  They are the same people from whom the Government tried to remove personal assistant services in September.  Many of those in receipt of personal assistant services are also in receipt of the allowance and the grant.  By and large, the people in receipt of the grants have fixed incomes.<\/p><p>  Today, a girl asked me to raise her case with the committee.  She is called Rachel and she lives in Raheny.  Rachel is a wheelchair user who must take oxygen.  Although she lives in Raheny, which is in Dublin, she cannot access public transport.  If she goes to get a bus, she cannot wait outside for very long, because doing so affects her lungs.  She has tried public transport, but sometimes she has needed to wait 20 minutes or half an hour for a properly accessible bus to come along.  One or two buses with ramps might arrive, but those ramps might not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600012#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Lee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362591000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but there is a vote in the D&aacute;il.

The allowance and the grant are vital supports for many members who have specialised access requirements not provided by mainstream public transport.  Taking them away, as evidenced in Rachel's case, would definitely result in isolation from the community.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the existing schemes and the confusion about what will replace them has unnecessarily instilled fear in many people with disabilities.

What way is that to treat people in 2013?  It will definitely lead to increased social isolation for people with disabilities, decreasing quality of life and employment opportunities.

The grant enables people to choose when they want to go out but that choice is removed when one must book a van in advance.  That van or minibus may collect a few others as well, so one may have to wait for a considerable period before getting to the destination.<\/p><p>  Before the break I mentioned how the HSE, the Minister and Department may not have considered the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities before going ahead with their decision.  We wonder what sort of thought went into it.  There does not appear to be any proper cost projects to prove the affordability of problems with regard to the actions.  They do not seem to have properly assessed the needs of those in receipt of the funding and the effects that the withdrawal will have on them.  It might end up costing the State much more to do what is being proposed.  Interestingly, the scheme was not encompassed in the value-for-money review of the disability services programme, and we are trying to tie this in with the national disability strategy.<\/p><p>  With regard to what can be done to make this more efficient from an administration perspective, we are not just here to criticise and we can be consulted as well.  Perhaps the mobility allowance could become part of the disability allowance, which is means-tested anyway.  Did the Department explore that option?  On the other side of the coin, people still in institutions may only have &euro;20 or &euro;30 left from the disability allowance once they have handed over moneys and the mobility allowance was really all they had to allow them out of institutions.  That was their means of leaving institutional settings in many cases.<\/p><p>  We have heard that the Department will write to people in receipt of the allowance to get their views on it.  Engaging with people by letter could be difficult.  In the past public health nurses could explain what was in the letter and provide assistance but we question this type of consultation.  Is this going to be the only form of direct consultation with the recipients or will there be more meaningful consultation beyond writing a letter?<\/p><p>  Ms Shelly Gaynor is in the Visitors Gallery and she made a valid point.  She told me she paid for her car from the allowance, as she got a loan on the strength of the allowance and the motorised transport grant.

Deputy Peter Mathews fairly well summed up the position we would take.  If we are looking at a cost of &euro;200 million over three years for the motorised transport grant, that is 65 million per annum, and 100 million per annum for the mobility allowance, it is interesting to note that the press releases mentioned the cost as &euro;300 million, now they say one component of that costs &euro;200 million over three years.  Even taking &euro;200 million for the motorised transport grant, that is &euro;65 million per annum, in terms of the people in receipt of that grant, it would cater for 50 times the number of people who are currently in receipt of it.<\/p><p>  The Secretary General specifically said there would be significant financial risks to the State.  I do not think that enabling people with disabilities to participate in society should be considered in the same breath as a significant financial risk to the State.  We often hear that language in terms of the banks and the amount of money that has been paid out in relation to that area.  That sort of language is not acceptable when talking about the people with disabilities who are the recipients of this allowance and are the most vulnerable members of society.  <\/p><p>  This allowance was established, as the Secretary General said, by way of a Department circular in 1968.  That circular was amended over the years.  The 1992 Finance Act, which amended the 1989 Finance Act, enabled the then Minister in 1994 to set out the parameters in terms of medical criteria to qualify for a primary medical certificate.  It is clear from the regulations that a very restrictive interpretation was taken of disability and they refer to severe impairment.  Any person who has sought an assessment for the grant and the allowance will be aware of the strict criteria that apply.  If one is not issued with a primary medical certificate in one's locality, one is entitled under the 1994 regulations to go to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  No matter where in the country one lives, one has to present there for appeal.  That appeal is, effectively, another medical assessment, although in our view it should be wider than that.  The regulations would seem to suggest that it could be wider than that.  The appeals board, effectively, is a further medical assessment.  I was there the other day when 27 appeals were being heard that day by one board comprised of three medical doctors.  I was there with a gentleman from County Clare who lives ten miles from the nearest bus stop.  He arrived at 12.20 p.m. and was seen by the board at 1 p.m.   When we sought clarification as to the actual function of the board there appeared to be some confusion.  In this day and age it is not acceptable that 27 cases are heard in when one day when two or three hours should be spent on a particular case.  I will ask Mr. Michael McCabe if there are any further points he wishes me to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600015#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Lee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362591600,"counter":941,"content":"<p>If there are any questions we will be happy to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600015#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591600,"counter":942,"content":"<p>I will have to leave for a vote in about two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600015#R00700","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591600,"counter":943,"content":"<p>I will let the Senator in first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600015#R00800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1362591600,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and will be as quick as I can.

She has met us a number of times, not in regard to this.  We do not question her bona fides and where she is coming from in relation to this.  As a Minister of State, it would appear that she does not have devolved powers.  Of significance here is the fact that there has been no statement of significance at all by any of the senior Ministers in Government, and that is what would concern us.  There is no Minister for disability at the Cabinet table and perhaps there needs to be.  There does not seem to be a voice for those with disabilities at the Cabinet table.<\/p><p>  On the use of the word \"axed\", we decided deliberately to use that word.  The mobility allowance is &euro;9 million.  There is a further &euro;1.3 million on the motorised transport grant.  If it is &euro;10.3 million and that money is being ring-fenced to enable a new system to come into place that will have more recipients, then there will be a smaller amount of money in the pot to be divided round and it follows that there must be less money available to those who are already in receipt.  That is a best case scenario.  That is saying that recipients will be paid directly.  However, indications are that the money will be given to service providers to provide transport for persons with disabilities.  Certainly, that is what had been stated initially, after this story broke.  That is why we used the word \"axed\".

The big question we need to discuss is how we will do that, given the current situation, and what is Mr. McCabe's view about how we can do it.<\/p><p>  The Government's position, as I see it, is to say that it wants to safeguard the resources necessary to provide those with disabilities with the existing allowances and grants but, because of this legal situation, it can no longer do it anymore and if it simply opens up the scheme to all those who would be entitled to it, it would cost the State more.  There are questions as to whether the Government is grossly exaggerating how much more it would cost or has it any basis for making these assumptions.  Those are legitimate queries and questions that we should be asking.  However, nobody can fully answer that.  It is possible it will cost more, perhaps not as much as the Government says.<\/p><p>  Against that background, I would like to know the centre's attitude to that.  I know my attitude.  This is what I am trying to get at here.  My attitude is very simple, that those with a disability have a right to these allowances and anybody who has disabilities who requires this allowance or grant, whether over 66, under 66, only needing it only in their latter years or have needed it all of their lives, as far as I am concerned, should have it.  The scheme should be opened up and the State should find the funding.<\/p><p>  If the Government says it has not got the funding, I say the Government has it for the bondholders, the rich or whatever.  That is my attitude.  I wonder whether that is Mr. McCabe's attitude.  That is one way of approaching the problem, by simply saying we demand the resources, they should be provided as there is a right and entitlement to them.  Finding the resources is the Government's problem.  The alternative approach is to accept the Government line that it wants to give the allowance to the existing recipients but it does not have any more than &euro;10.9 million, and on that basis, work out a solution with the Government around how that &euro;10.9 million continues to go to those who currently get it.

He is also a close friend of mine and a delightful chap.  I can praise the Centre for Independent Living because I know of the sterling work done at the centre in Sligo.  It makes a huge difference to the lives of people.<\/p><p>  With regard to the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, I picked up on two matters during the earlier session with Dr. McLoughlin.  He seems to understand the impact the suspension of these schemes will have on the people who need them, but the Department seems to be blinded by either legal or economic considerations.  Can we not do the right thing if the legal or economic situations do not allow us to do so?<\/p><p>  It troubles me that such stress was laid on the fact that these schemes are administrative, in other words they are not statutory schemes.  I would argue, and the Centre for Independent Living should argue, that schemes such as the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant should be a right and not a concession.  This is what administrative schemes means, that they are concessions and do not fit into the general income maintenance and welfare part of the State.  They are concessions, which means they can be taken back without having to change the law.  The witnesses must be very vigilant about this.  It is one of the reasons I asked Dr. McLoughlin for a comprehensive list of all of the so-called administrative schemes.  I am concerned other such schemes exist.<\/p><p>  This decision is unfair and unjustifiable.  If the witnesses and the committee can make people understand what this is about there would be very strong public backing for the restoration of these schemes.  This must be done.  I am not convinced the proposal to incorporate the mobility allowance scheme and motorised transport grant as part of the disability allowance would, of itself, solve the problem.  There would be some reduction in administrative overhead processing but it certainly would not be of the order of the money the Government claims is needed to apply the scheme more widely.  The Centre for Independent Living should be involved in the working group, which should examine the specific mobility needs of people of a certain age.  This can be done without breaching any legislation.<\/p><p>  I was at a presentation by the Department of Social Protection last week where someone stated the Department has more than 70 different schemes.  I have no doubt if they were to be rationalised and streamlined every person depending on the Department of Social Protection could get a far bigger check at a far lower cost to the Exchequer but nobody has taken up this proposition.<\/p><p>  It will be a battle to restore the scheme and grant and make no mistake about it.  The Government is blinded by the economy at present.  The Centre for Independent Living has offered to be part of the review body.  I agree with my colleague that we should recommend to the Government that the witnesses form part of the review body, and I ask them to contact us about any help we can be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013030600017#T01000","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362592800,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.

I echo what Deputies Boyd Barrett and Colreavy have said.  Participation in the review group would be very helpful because the centre told its story very well.  More importantly, its representatives said and described well what it would mean for a person if he or she did not have the allowance or the motor transport grant.  A picture was painted of the minibuses or ambulances instead of the independence as the justified and valid reason to enable people to go to places of work, study or for social purposes, just like any other citizen.  Their case was made very well.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Colreavy has said, one must raise the matter, magnify it but keep it simple.  Do not have too many snowflakes in the blizzard.  Please use pictures carefully and well and approach the right people.  Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin showed empathy and understanding.  Then one gets the fearfulness and anxiety that bureaucrats can frighten themselves with.  They are presented with a legal situation and they freeze.  One can set aside or tell the legal people to organise the law to suit what is right, proper and good.  That is the job at hand and I give the group every encouragement in that regard.<\/p><p>  As a by-product, one of the aspects that has stayed with me since last week - I do not know if the committee members will also remember it - was the fit-out of the Garda car fleet using a budget of &euro;10 million.

We welcome those viewing at home on UPC channel 207, which is available in over 300,000 homes across the country.<\/p><p>  Over the next four meetings, we plan to explore how the irresponsible use of social media channels might be curbed.  We are also inviting members of the public and interested groups across the country to have their say and feed into the process.  They can do so by going to our website at <i>oireachtas.ie<\/i> and we thank all those individuals and groups who have taken the time to make a contribution so far. <\/p><p>  In commencing our public discussions on this matter, I emphasise that the committee&rsquo;s consideration of this area is not about politicians.  Rather we want to explore how the rights of ordinary citizens can be protected on social media outlets.  There has been increasing public concern about the nature of some social media commentary.  These hearings are about protecting the citizens we serve, and ensuring that individual rights are maintained and vindicated across social media channels. <\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, for his presence here today and look forward to hearing his perspective as we commence our discussions.  This will be followed by a presentation by officials from the Office for Internet Safety.  This office plays a key role in co-ordinating the State's approach to Internet safety.  The social media companies will also assist us in producing an outcome that is in the public interest.  We look forward to welcoming representatives from Twitter and Facebook at tomorrow's hearings.  Next week we will hear from representatives of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition, who will inform us on the issue of cyberbullying.<\/p><p>  We start this consultation with open minds.  If we get this right, we will have endeavoured to protect individuals and safeguard the potential of social media from those who seek to subvert it.  There is no doubt that social media have immense potential for public good and civic engagement and the committee simply wants to ensure that they do so without impacting adversely on people's individual rights.  Informed by these public hearings, along with the submissions received from the public, we will prepare a report with practical recommendations to be considered by Government.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and his officials.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that the opening statements you have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600003#C00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362562200,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting me to appear before them.

The Minister outlined in detail the problem and the complexities of arriving at a solution to it.  There are a number of issues to consider.  The Minister acknowledges that there appears to be a gap in the legislation.  In the first instance, it is an international issue.  Are discussions taking place at forums such as the United Nations?  One must acknowledge the success of the Internet and the benefits it brings to individuals and society, but its abuse has disastrous consequences for young and old.  We must examine how to put in place a legal framework for its safe use.<\/p><p>  Certain issues emerge from the Minister's statement and comments which have been made on the issue over the last while.  Comments posted on whatever online forum are subject to the same legal regime as if they were made in broadcast or print media.  Many people using online systems do not believe that to be the case.  They feel they can make comments of any description and have no responsibility for the consequences.  That is a good place to start.  The Minister has set out the Department's position and the committee is endeavouring to come up with recommendations from the next few meetings to see if we can move this difficult issue forward.  What is happening at international level and is it too early to indicate the form of legislation the Department or Departments are working on or envisage?  As the Minister rightly acknowledges, there may be a legislative gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600005#E00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1362563400,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Deputy Moynihan is probably correct to say that some people have the impression that the normal law of the land does not apply online and a minority behaves recklessly without any regard to the hurt they inflict.  The truth is that defamation law and the criminal law relating to harassment apply online.  In the latter case, the Garda has advised my Department that the interpretation by the courts of the law on harassment is very narrow.  It may be worth the committee's time to probe whether it is feasible to refurbish the law in that particular regard.  The Defamation Act 2009 applies to online comments as it does to comment offline.  If defamatory content is posted outside the jurisdiction, redress poses a significant challenge to the average citizen.  There is no point in brushing over that.<\/p><p>  The answer to Deputy Moynihan's second question is \"Yes\".  These issues have been discussed at the Council of Europe and to a lesser extent at European Union level.  It has come to be discussed recently in the EU but has not traditionally been a manifest competence of the Union.  The discussion has gone on more at the Council of Europe which has made recommendations and reached conclusions on safer and better Internet use, especially for children.  The focus has been on children and the Department of Education and Skills has recently published guidelines on the area.  If the Deputy is asking if I think it would be possible to legislate on an international basis, while I look forward to the committee's decision and the expert evidence, it is extremely difficult to do that.  It is not feasible.

These are reputable companies - major corporations.  For example, Facebook alone has 1 billion users.  Good corporate citizenship ought to mean that they should be prepared, in their host countries, to enter into sensible protocols about, for example, their take-down policy.  Some colleagues have told me about a particular case or issue where it was difficult to find anyone in certain companies who would admit to having responsibility for this.  What is offensive can be in the eye of the beholder but there are many examples where there is no disagreement between the company and the complainant.  In those circumstances there ought to be identifiable access whereby the complainant can have his or her complaint assessed and where the company should act speedily.  It would be very interesting to hear the companies' view directly on that question because it is not something that one could practically legislate for, even if one were minded to do so.  In any event there are difficulties when one talks about taste and tone and so on.  Even if one could address multi-jurisdictional facets of this, one would have great difficulties addressing in law the nuance associated with that.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony is right that it is very difficult to deal with the anonymity issue.  As a former teacher himself he is aware that bullying did not come in with the Internet.  It has been there since the use of the felt-tip pen on the back of the toilet door and so on, but as he says, under the cloak of anonymity it can be used in a minority of cases to devastating effect.  That is one of the difficult issues to deal with.<\/p><p>  There is a major court case being heard in Germany around and about the terrain of Deputy O'Mahony's first question and it will be very interesting to see how it is decided.  If my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills. were here he would add to that answer by saying that parents have a role in this as well.

Something so traumatic in our community made us wonder what we were doing and what we should do differently.  The challenge for the Government, and for us all, is to ensure that people's basic rights can be safeguarded, that serious or persistent damaging behaviour can be addressed, all the while ensuring that the right to freedom of expression and freedom of access to information is not harmed.  It is a question of respect.  We are considering cyberbullying here but I am aware that there are many more stresses on people, whether they be financial ones or cutbacks in, for example, the number of guidance counsellors in schools.

Colleagues are focusing on the minority of serious new challenges that it poses for society and the Government, but its capacity to do good and to transform the way we interact with one another is almost unlimited.  Consider its impact on political developments.  Consider the phenomenon of the Arab Spring, which no one in these Houses would have predicted ten years ago.  The technology has had an amazing influence.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy is focusing on some of the very sad instances that this country has seen.  In this regard, we must do everything we can to protect our children in particular.  However, I must repeat the fact that bullying did not come in with the Internet.  There has been bullying inside and outside our school system since Adam was a boy.  It can be elevated to a new level by this technology.<\/p><p>  Best practice is slowly evolving.  The committee will be interested to know that there have recently been a number of high profile cases in which court orders have been effected requiring the service providers to disclose the identities of anonymous persons posting offensive material.  This relates to the question raised by Deputy O'Mahony.  In many instances, it is possible to get service providers to track anonymous posters.  This is under way in a number of jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  \"Yes\" is the answer to Deputy Colreavy's question.  The optimum co-operation between my Department and the Department of Education and Skills is desirable.  Yesterday, the Minister for Education and Skills and I launched the high speed broadband programme for schools in the wider Dublin region, including counties Meath and Kildare.  We visited a school where we saw at first hand the extraordinary potential of this technology.  In an inner city school four young women are taking higher level maths remotely.  They are being taught by a teacher in a different school in Clondalkin.  One could not afford to have a higher level maths class devoted to four students, but they can use the technology to study thanks to the co-operation of Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de in Clondalkin.  There are tremendous possibilities.<\/p><p>  Schools teach and have regard to the safety considerations to which the Deputy referred.  Students are way ahead of their parents in terms of knowledge concerning the pitfalls and the capacity of the technology.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy is correct in that it is undoubtedly a question of raising awareness.  It is also a question of co-operation between the Departments and agencies involved.  I anticipate that this is the area in respect of which the committee is likely to make recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600007#G00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1362564600,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and, in particular, his presentation.

I agree with the Minister's final comment that social media is a power for good and that bullying has always been and will continue to be a fact of life.  Bullying is developing with technology.  It has moved from a piece of chewing gum being fired from the end of a ruler at the back of the classroom to iPhones.  It will adapt as technology improves.  In terms of how we are going to address it, we need to be realistic.  The Minister put his finger on it when he said that cross-country legislative frameworks are not realistic.  That is the first thing we need to acknowledge before deciding on what we can do.<\/p><p>  The Minister said earlier that some people have yet to fully appreciate that public messages via social media have the same legal character as when published in a newspaper.  The problem that arises is that for an awful lot of people, access to a system whereby they can clear their name, either in relation to a social media or newspaper article, is prohibitive.  The courts in Ireland are for many reasons the reserve of people with money.  Redress for a person who has been defamed in the print or social media is prohibitive.  Up to now the focus of the conversation on this issue has been primarily around young people who are technologically mobile.  The difficulty of accessing the courts in terms of cost and time arises.  As the Minister said, there has been limited success in terms of obtaining court orders in this area.  I believe the committee's focus must be on making our courts system more accessible to people in this modern era.  We must ensure the Courts Service takes account of the changed environment in which we are operating.  It is an institution that does not move as quickly as we would like it to.  <\/p><p>  In terms of its work in this area, the committee needs to focus on how to make the courts more accessible and affordable to people wishing to have their rights reinforced and on how we can ensure people are aware that when they post on a social media site it is the same as publishing it in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> or <i>Irish Independent<\/i> in terms of consequences.  That is the challenge for this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600008#H00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1362565200,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>Deputy Harrington asked what is going on.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has already referred the harassment issue, under the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, to the Law Reform Commission and asked it to report on that matter.  The Deputy will be aware that in terms of changing criminal law the Law Reform Commission regularly reports, having teased out issues in the type of detail necessary.  In this case, the Minister has made that referral, particularly in the context of cyber bullying.  It will be interesting to read the findings of that report.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Harrington's question about whether this issue is being debated on a cross-jurisdictional basis and so on, the answer is, \"Yes\".  I referred earlier to the Council of Europe and European Union, where work is under way focused mainly on the production of guidelines in this particular area.  Last year, the European Union adopted Council conclusions on better Internet usage for children.

It is timely he should appear before the committee before it commences its work on this issue.  As stated by the Minister, there have been enormous improvements in the area of communications on Facebook and Twitter, much of which is for the better.  The Minister also mentioned the Arab Spring in the context of how social media can lead to social change.  However, there is also a downside to it, which became evident during the riots in the UK.  People involved in rioting are using Twitter and Facebook to communicate about and plan attacks.  It is the downside of social media that people are bringing to our attention.  This is the area we need to address.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned the gap in the legislation.  The committee engaged a couple of weeks ago with a barrister from the Minister's Department on the right to freedom of expression, which we were told at that time also includes the right to anonymity.  While we must respect that right, the misuse of anonymity arises.  A tweet to the \"Frontline\" programme approximately one year ago, which impacted on the debate taking place at that time, was disowned.  That is a case of misuse of the right to anonymity.  When representatives of RTE appeared before the committee they told us that they did not have the technological expertise to trace that tweet.  It appears to me that this is an area in which there is a gap in the legislation.  Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have taken off since enactment of the Defamation Act 2009.  People believe that this Act relates in the main to defamation in the print media.  <\/p><p>  Does the Minister believe there is need for further legislation in this area, particularly in regard to traceability of tweets which could be considered bullying, harassment or even worse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600008#H00700","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1362565200,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister to this meeting.

That may well be something that could be teased out in some detail by the committee.<\/p><p>  The issue of anonymity is very complex, and it was raised by Deputies Kenny and O'Mahony.  This is before coming to the very tough question from Deputy O'Donovan.  It is possible to get a court order to require a service provider to make the identity of the person who posted the offensive material known.  Deputy O'Donovan raises the pertinent question that gets to the heart of the matter, which is that the court system is like the Ritz in that it is \"open\" to everyone.  That is a significant issue.<\/p><p>  The print media has addressed the issue through the construction of the Press Council of Ireland and the press ombudsman, which has worked quite well.  It provides protection to the media, rooted in the Defamation Act, and it provides protection from enormous damages.  Some 90% of complainants want speedy apologies, retractions etc., which is provided by this route rather than going through the court system.  Could we see a day when new social media would come under the kind of arrangements in place for the print media?  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility and there are areas of the most well-established and respected elements of new media, some of which have made application to the Press Council of Ireland to be included.  The area could be examined.<\/p><p>  Deputy Phelan raises the questions of incitement to hatred, racial abuse, etc.  The law applies in that respect but I do not have an easy answer to Deputy O'Donovan's question about how easy it is to vindicate one's rights in this country.  Access to the court system is prohibitively expensive for some citizens and the discussion is wider than the subject matter before us today.  It may well be that there are some mechanisms short of the full court system that would allow speedy redress to most complainants.<\/p><p>  That returns us to the point about take-down policy.

How politicians, parliamentarians or directors of national theatres can handle criticism posted on social media is something.  I do not think that we are in a crisis.  I heard the Minister say, and it is important, that we should develop a set of emerging best practice guidelines.  He urged that the committee must be confident enough to address the issue from a point of strength and positivity.  Social media is extraordinary, empowering, educational and a creative tool.  I slightly disagree with Senator Healy Eames, not about the abuse, but that social media is an empowering tool for teenagers.  <\/p><p>  Yesterday, I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht where three schools, one each from Indreabh&aacute;n, Lucan and Cork made presentations as gaeilge because it was Seachtain na Gaeilge on the strengths and weaknesses of social media.  They outlined the positive and empowering aspects of social media.  It is extraordinary how social media develops human contact and opinions and elicits opinions from teenagers.  It acts as a mediator for those relationships.  According to those teenagers social media is not about the local but it is about the global world and being connected.  Social media did not replace local communication but reduces their world.  <\/p><p>  The Minister may not be able to answer my question but perhaps one of his officials will.  All of those teenagers put their criticism of <i>ask.fm<\/i> on the record.  They cited it as being the one social media tool that had anonymity and all of us here have recognised that anonymity is a pervasive and negative element.  Perhaps we should approach the anonymity of bullying and cyberbullying.  Will the committee invite a representative of <i>ask.fm<\/i> to attend?  Has the Minister been approached by <i>ask.fm<\/i>?

Where does accountability lie when it comes to the cyberbully?  Does accountability lie with the adult who does it?  Does it lie with the parent of the young person who is cyberbullying?  Does it lie with the service provider?  We know what happens if a defamatory comment is made in the print media.  Obviously the newspaper is responsible for what it prints and it has legal protection.  Does the responsibility lie with the education system in terms of teaching young people how not to abuse social media?<\/p><p>  Traceability and accountability also go hand in hand.  The Minister stated that one can seek a court order to identify an IP address.  The difficulty that we have with the Internet is cyberbullying because 0.9% of what goes on it is not good.  Is there any way that we can eliminate anonymity?  For example, when someone seeks an IP address should he or she be asked to supply his or her passport number?  Should they give a credit card number?  If somebody wants to post something on the Internet should there be a charge?  Imposing a cost could discourage people from posting something online.  Is there any way to eliminate the anonymity of social media?

This particular issue appears to be one on which we ought to see whether there are any remedies available.<\/p><p>  I refer Senator Coghlan to an e-commerce directive which dealt in a different context with the question he raised.  That directive, which is quite recent, stipulates that service providers are mere conduits and are not liable for the information transmitted over their networks, and that member states cannot impose a general obligation to monitor the traffic over those networks.  In fact, there is case law of the European Court of Justice on that issue.  It is a very difficult matter.  One can go to court and get an order to require the service provider where at all feasible, and in most cases I believe it is feasible, to expose the anonymity.  However, one comes up against the issue raised by Deputy O'Donovan that not everybody can afford to go to the court for such an order, especially if there is a cross-jurisdictional dimension.

The office operates from within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am accompanied by the head of the office, Mr. Hugh Boyle, and by Ms Siobh&aacute;n McCabe and Mr. Edward Shortt from the office.<\/p><p>  Our work falls under two main headings.  First, we encourage respectful behaviour in electronic communications, which includes social media.  To put it another way, we are actively involved in counteracting the abuse of communications technology where it involves using phones, e-mail or other electronic means to send messages or images with the intention of harassing or intimidating the recipient or where they are intended to damage someone&rsquo;s good name and reputation.  This is clearly a serious matter.  The second major area is to ensure we have robust arrangements to prevent, in so far as possible, the dissemination of illegal Internet content, especially child pornography.<\/p><p>  Before I deal further with the two areas I have mentioned, let me emphasise that we regard the growth in electronic communications as an overwhelmingly positive development.  Unfortunately, some people&rsquo;s enjoyment of this great resource is impaired by its misuse in the hands of a few.  Our role is to encourage a positive environment where the benefits of the new technology can be enjoyed.  We try to counteract the misuse by not only raising awareness about the consequences of misuse but also by giving advice on how to respond.  We are always at pains to stress that the response must be moderate and reasonable, but firm, and must not inflame an already dangerous situation.<\/p><p>  I would like to give the committee an overview on how we go about our work.  First, we identify our target audiences and then we select the messages appropriate to each of these audiences.  In this way we can maximise the impact and effect.  As an example, victims may need information on simple steps they can take to block access to their online profile or they may need helpline numbers.  We aim to meet their needs.<\/p><p>  Parents and teachers have responsibility for the persons in their care.  Their position also presents many opportunities to spot the danger signs that suggest a young person may be the victim of cyberbullying.  The fact that bullying is being done electronically, by stealth, is likely to heighten the distress.  Unlike situations where the person being bullied, physically or verbally, may have the opportunity to move away from the bully, in situations of cyberbullying, the victim may never feel removed from the source of the abuse.  We work to help parents and teachers to spot and identify the danger signs.  We also help them to address their concerns in this regard, particularly any concerns they may have about their own ability to understand the technologies, so enabling them to engage with their children about the use of these technologies.<\/p><p>  In recent times, more emphasis has been placed on a third group, often called bystanders.  Bystanders are, for example, team mates, work colleagues or fellow students.  It is now recognised that bystanders may be able to play a significant role in breaking the isolation and misery of the victim.  They may notice changes in the victim&rsquo;s mood or behaviour.  Sometimes they can make sensitive and discreet enquiries or, more often, they can alert another who is in a position to deal with the problem.  Our role is to make bystanders aware of the good they can do.<\/p><p>  We also give much thought to the means by which we deliver our messages.  We rely on print and, increasingly, on the Internet.  Our printed materials are in high demand and are popular with parents.  Our website is a useful resource with relevant advice.  Its value is greatly enhanced by the numerous links to other sites, in particular to the helplines operated by the National Parents Council Primary, the ISPCC, the Professional Development Service for Teachers and the hotline service.<\/p><p>  The office for Internet safety co-ordinates the EU-funded safer Internet project for Ireland.  We partner with four agencies, the National Parents Council Primary, the ISPCC, the National Council for Technology in Education and the hotline, in channelling funding to initiatives in the Internet safety area.  The office has also developed close relations with the Garda schools programme, particularly in the supply of awareness raising materials for visits to schools, including the materials produced for safer Internet day in February each year.<\/p><p>  The agencies that participate in the EU programme are heavily focused on young persons still in the education system.  This reflects the importance attached to that cohort when it comes to forming good habits in what is already their main means of communication.  The emphasis on that section of the population is justified by the evidence.  They are high consumers of technology and we want them to be aware of the dangers of misuse.  We also want to ensure they carry these messages into their adult years.  Collaboration with the five agencies I mentioned means we are getting the messages across in an effective, targeted and cost-effective way.<\/p><p>  Before I conclude on this part of our work, I would like to stress that the office is not a law enforcement body, nor does it pursue or investigate individual cases.  Instead, our role is to heighten general awareness.  I mentioned the hotline a moment ago and this brings me to the second major area of our work.  The office for Internet safety supports the work of <i>hotline.ie<\/i>.  The facility is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland to receive reports from the public of illegal activities on websites and is part-funded by the EU.  The activity can vary but, for the most part, it relates to child pornography.  The service has formalised its links with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under agreed arrangements, the hotline service notifies the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where a site is considered to contain illegal material.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigates the matter where the site is hosted in Ireland and in other cases it notifies the authorities in the other jurisdiction where a site is hosted outside of Ireland.<\/p> <p>The hotline is part of an international network, INHOPE.  It has played a major role in reducing incidents of child pornography, including inadvertent viewing on the web.  As we know, those who are determined to view and exchange material have developed ways of doing so by using methods which circumvent the web.  The Garda and police forces internationally continuously seek out such activity with some very welcome success.  As far as the public is concerned, the chances of coming across child pornography on a website have been greatly reduced by the vigilance of members of the public who report the sites to the hotline and by the mechanisms operated by the hotline service and its counterparts abroad for removing the offending material.  The work of the office for Internet safety and its partners is subject to annual scrutiny by the European Commission and by experts retained by it.  I am pleased to say that our performance so far has always attracted positive comment.<\/p><p> I hope I have given members sufficient information to help them to understand our role.  My colleagues and I would be pleased to try to address any questions or comments members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600012#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362568200,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Keeffe for that overview.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600013#N00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362568200,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials from the office for Internet safety.

I know the office does not have the power to investigate but comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We need stronger language even though, as was said during the discussions with the Minister, a small minority of people are abusing this.  I encourage the office to look at the language it is using and to use stronger language to ensure it is fit for purpose in this regard and gives the impression that it is tackling this in a very serious way.  We might have the greatest intentions to encourage people from junior infants to adulthood, but not wanting to be flippant, certain aspects of the game are very serious, including registering IP addresses outside particular jurisdictions.

I did not realise that representatives of the office were the next to speak.  I regret to say I had never heard of the Office for Internet Safety before this morning, which is probably even more embarrassing for me.  It is probably my fault.

Its presentation is central to the work this committee will do in the coming weeks to assess whether the State should intervene in the area of social media.  I believe any intervention should be absolutely minimal and should be aimed at ensuring people act within the law.  I want to pick up on the point that was made about something that is legal or illegal offline also being legal or illegal online.  That is not strictly the case, unfortunately, in one small respect.  The Minister made the point that there is a gap in the legislation relating to online contact that takes the form of harassment or bullying.

Online bullying takes place on many platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and <i>ask.fm<\/i>.  The websites I have mentioned account for a significant amount of online activity.  Offline bullying should be dealt with where it happens.  In my opinion, bullying in the playground should be dealt with in the playground and bullying at home should be dealt with at home.  If bullying takes place on Facebook, Twitter or another platform, does the office have a presence to deal with it?  Has it been in contact with the companies in question to deal with some of the issues that have come to light?  We will address those issues in the coming weeks when we hear the testimonies of various parties.<\/p><p>  Is Ms O'Keeffe satisfied that her office is in a position to do its work competently?  I appreciate that much of its work relates to child pornography and similar issues.  Is Ms O'Keeffe satisfied that the legislation governing issues like online harassment and cyberbullying is up to scratch? If not, can she say whether she has reported or commented on areas where she would like legislation to be introduced to allow the office to do its work fully?  Has she worked or had any contact with the Minister's office or the Law Reform Commission?  Has she had any feedback from them, obviously through the Department?  While I had not heard of the office before today - <i>mea culpa<\/i> - I believe it has a central role in what we are trying to do.  The lack of awareness of the role of the office is a problem that needs to be addressed.  I do not know whether it should be addressed by the office or by this committee.  Information about this resource needs to get out there.  Perhaps this presentation will do some good in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600014#O02100","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1362568800,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputies Patrick O'Donovan and Ann Phelan, I would like to clarify what I said earlier about the problem of telecommunications interference.

The Act deals with direct communications with a person but does not deal with communications about a person.  This is a straightforward anomaly.  Does the office for Internet safety have a statutory role in terms of making recommendations to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and-or the Minister for Justice and Equality on implementing changes to legislation?  Has the office made a recommendation to either Department on this anomaly?<\/p><p>  To reinforce the point made by Deputy Colreavy, I understand there is not much point in tracing someone for an act unless the act in question is illegal.  If there is a loophole, an act may well be undesirable but it is certainly not illegal.  If we are not taking steps to make the act illegal, the loophole must be closed.<\/p><p>  How many members of staff are available to the office and what is its annual budget?  There is a lack of awareness about the office.  Is its role purely advisory in nature or can it make recommendations on legislative and regulatory deficits?

On the public persona of the office or the fact that some people were not aware of its function, in fairness to everyone, this may be because we work through partners, for example, the Garda schools programme, the National Parents Council Primary and the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE.  We do a great deal of work through our partners which disseminate a large quantity of material on our behalf.  We hope schools have come across this material through those bodies.  I have with me copies of some of the booklets we have produced.  Requests for booklets are submitted to us from parents and schools and we meet these requests all the time.  Demand for these booklets is very strong.  I am sure I can provide members with the most recent figures on demand.  It may be that people are not aware of the office for Internet safety but they will be aware of our work through the schools, Garda schools programmes and the National Parents Council, with which we work all the time.  I am reminded also that we work through the ISPCC and Childline.  We work through many partners.<\/p><p>  The key role of the office is to try to provide information and support to various people.  Deputy Michael Moynihan asked whether we offered anything specific in terms of the strength of the support we give to people.  I have with me some material we produced for Internet Day in February this year.  I can leave copies or send some to the joint committee after the meeting.  The material is in the form of a leaflet, bookmark and poster for use in schools and so forth.  The leaflet contains a specific message to young people who believe they are in difficulty in this area.  It contains specific steps, written carefully and in plain English, for those who believe they are victims of cyberbullying.  It also contains the information the Deputy seeks on our contact details, including a telephone number, website and e-mail address for those who need to contact us.  Our telephone line is not intended for use by children who may be in a particular difficult situation immediately, although obviously we will also take such calls.  We try, through our website and telephone lines, to refer such children and young people on to where they would receive the help they need, for example, specialist services operating in this area.<\/p><p>  We keep our website under review to ensure it remains interesting and attractive to young people who may find themselves in a difficult position.  It provides a large amount of information on what a person should do in particular circumstances and who they should contact.  Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses are provided on the website.

This demonstrates the difficulty for the law to keep up to speed with the level of change that occurs.  Change in the law is a slow process, but changes in technology happen much faster.  We are always playing catch up to some extent, but at least the issues have been identified and are being examined.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600017#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I suppose the fact these hearings are taking place demonstrates we are playing catch up.

This morning, we heard the Minister say that to try to do something about social media would be quite difficult in an international context.  The Internet is viewed in the western world as being very positive, but in other parts of the world it is used by governments and it is they who abuse it.  On the issue of the Minister's take-down policy, we need to identify tools that automatically trigger a take-down policy.  Once certain words are identified, a site should close down automatically.  Would Ms O'Keeffe like to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600017#R01300","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362570600,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>In terms of the cross-border or international aspect, it will always be difficult to ensure co-operation, because the Internet does not recognise geographical borders.  How we operate is that whenever something is reported to the hotline, if the material is illegal and the site is hosted in Ireland, we report it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they pursue it in the normal course.  However, if the site is hosted outside of the jurisdiction, the Garda will deal with its colleagues in the police force in the appropriate jurisdiction to try to proceed on the issue.  We also talk to the Internet service provider, with a view to having the material taken down.  I suspect there may be difficulties with regard to a site closing down automatically, but I will defer to Mr. Boyle on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600017#R01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362570600,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>Deputy Phelan suggested that certain words might trigger closing down of sites, but that can be difficult to implement because it all depends on the context.  Sometimes a word might be used in the context of academic research or in another perfectly legitimate context and we do not want to interfere with that type of issue.  That is the difficulty.  It is all about not interfering unnecessarily with the free exchange of information and ideas.  When we receive complaints through the hotline service or when complaints are made generally, there is a procedure to deal with the complaint.  We must look at the site before making a request for removal of material.  If it is not illegal but merely offensive, we might request the ISP to take it down.  If it is illegal, there is a stronger procedure in place and we pursue and investigate it with a view to prosecution if the offence is located in our jurisdiction.  If it is not in our jurisdiction, we pass the information on to the equivalent authorities elsewhere for action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013030600017#R01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1362570600,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I was thinking more or less along the lines of when it is to do with children and bullying.
