Section 10 inserts a new section after section 128E to provide for the introduction of a new share-option based relief for employees of SME companies, namely the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  It is designed to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises in the recruitment and retention of key employees.  It provides for a more advantageous tax treatment of gains arising on the exercise of qualifying share options acquired in SME companies.  Where the KEEP applies any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying share options granted during the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023 will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will however be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of conditions.  For example, the share option must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant; the share option must be held for a minimum period of one year before exercise, with limited exceptions; and the option must be exercised within ten years of grant to avail of this programme.  Monetary limits apply at both company and employee level.  The commencement of the programme is subject to EU State Aid approval, which I expect to issue shortly.  Recent developments with regard to the employment and investment incentive programme make it even more important that the KEEP programme is effective in meeting its policy objective.  With this in mind, the scope for further adjustments to this programme is being examined.  Last night I flagged that I may bring further amendments to this on Report Stage.<\/p><p>However, I should emphasise that any such adjustments would require State aid approval, and I need to strike a balance between what is desirable and what I can make happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#B01800","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does the Department have an estimate of what this tax expenditure will cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#C00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We estimate that over the medium term it will cost approximately &euro;10 million.

It rarely includes, to be fair to the Deputy's point, people on low incomes - I acknowledge that - but one of the developments that has occurred is that it now includes more and more middle-income employees, depending on the kind of industry they are in.  I think we saw share option schemes in the past as being forms of compensation for senior executives, but it is now the case, particularly within companies that are active in the digital economy, that they are being used, for example, to incentivise engineers and software designers, people who would very much be seen as middle-income earners and who are operationally vital to companies.  Those companies then use these schemes to try to retain those employees for the long run.  We have a growing amount of feedback to the effect that it is difficult to do this if one is below a certain level.  Companies that are below a certain level in scale tend to be more likely than not indigenous.  Again, that is why we are doing this.  However, the Deputy is correct in what he has said, that is, that this scheme will more than likely apply to people on middle incomes and above.  The only exception I can think of is if someone were to join on perhaps some form of graduate recruitment scheme.

We have had a lot of conversation around the housing crisis and the emergency the State has gone through in recent years, despite the fact that the Government fails to admit that it is an emergency.  There is a huge number of vacant homes across the State in areas where there is high pressure for housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has, for quite a considerable period, called for a vacant home tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, is leading the charge on this, among many other issues.  It baffles me that we have not seen any progress on a vacant home tax during budget 2018.  I am not arguing that every vacant property be taxed as a vacant home but at a time of huge crisis in the State and in areas of high housing pressure, it is immoral that there are vacant homes while 3,000 children and 5,000 adults are living in emergency accommodation.  In the past few months, Irish citizens have died on our streets.  People who are homeless are being forced to survive in the elements.  We need incentives to get vacant homes back into operation.<\/p><p>The previous section, which we discussed, contains minor incentives such as allowing pre-letting expenditure to be written off against rental income.  This is welcome and we support that amendment but it does not go far enough.  We need to take out the big stick in respect of the properties lying vacant in inner city Dublin.  The State needs to send a message to investors that if they leave their properties vacant at a time when there is massive pressure on the housing market and on supply, the State will tax them.  This amendment proposes that within six months of the passing of the Act, a report would be prepared and laid before the D&aacute;il on the subject of the introduction of a vacant homes tax.  The amendment takes this form because the Opposition is not allowed to table an amendment to immediately introduce a vacant homes tax.  If we had that ability I would have tabled an amendment to that effect.  It is important the Minister and the Government move on this without delay as we have had enough announcements.  We need serious action and I cannot understand why we are not considering a vacant home tax at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#D03000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>This amendment addresses vacancy, which is a policy area acknowledged by the Government as being central to housing challenges.  In response, a key objective, identified in the fifth pillar of the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is to ensure that existing housing stock is used to the optimum degree and it focuses on measures to use existing vacant stock to renew urban and rural areas and meet housing needs.  While building new homes is a key action, another effective way to meet our housing needs is to bring vacant and under-utilised properties back into full use.  Vacant properties are an important source of potential accommodation supply as they are typically already served by existing infrastructure.  Their reuse has the potential to reduce the number of additional new homes required and to renew both the urban and rural areas of which they form an intrinsic part.<\/p> <p>  As regards specific measures taken by Government to tackle vacancies, action 5.1 commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy, the publication of which is expected shortly.  Action 5.9 commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas of ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  A multidisciplinary working group, led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be working to bring greater clarity to the regulatory requirements that apply and to advise both industry and local authorities on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of under-utilised older vacant buildings in the context of the regulatory requirements.  At local authority level, it is considered that there is scope for some early actions and in August 2017, all local authorities were required to designate vacant home offices and to draw up vacant home action plans to identify the real scale of vacancy in their areas, to set an ambitious but realistic target for which vacant homes could ultimately be brought back into use, whether for private sale, rent or social housing purposes, and to engage with owners to this end.  The first of these action plans were submitted to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last week.<\/p> <p>  Other initiatives include the repair and leasing scheme; buy and renew scheme; and the Housing Agency acquisition fund.  Many other approaches have been considered by Government in tackling vacancy issues.  On the possibility of introducing a new vacant homes tax, a strong rationale would be needed.  It would also need to be demonstrated how exactly such a tax would achieve and deliver the desired outcome.  Proof would be needed as to how its public benefit would, for example, outweigh rights contained within the Constitution.  The fairness and proportionality of such a tax would need to be carefully considered, as would necessary exemptions, lead-in times, collection and many other issues.  Bearing in mind such complexities and the consequences of tax impositions, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government sought legal advice from the Attorney General and that advice is currently under consideration.  Consideration is also required as to the involvement and co-operation of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, and the implementation costs.<\/p> <p>  As there are multiple aspects to a vacant homes tax, I therefore oppose this amendment, which commits to laying a report on the matter within six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#E00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The Government has had a year to come up with a vacant homes strategy and it has failed to do so.  This was supposed to have been done months ago.  The Finance Bill is going through and there is no mention of a vacant homes strategy.  The three initiatives the Government has set in train for vacant homes are all welcome but they are minor.  They target some 6,500 vacant homes over a period of six years, which is 3% of vacant houses in the State.  It is not an adequate response to the crisis we are facing.  I urge the Minister, his Department and the Government to wake up to the realities that are out there.  Other actions need to be taken to deal with this issue.  There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State and 35,293 in Dublin alone.  However, there are 3,000 children and 5,000 adults in emergency accommodation.  When will we take out the stick to incentivise people to put their homes back into use?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said we needed to look at the constitutional rights of property but there is no bar to us applying a tax on a category of homes, and I do not need to be the Attorney General to say this.  We have a tax on the majority of homes in the form of the property tax, and prior to that we defined a certain category of homes, which were non-principal private residences, and applied a tax to them for a number of years.  It is completely lawful to tax houses not occupied by the owner just as it was lawful to tax houses which nobody occupied.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be an incentive for individuals to put their vacant stock back into use and a number of schemes can assist them in this but as it is not happening fast enough, we need a vacant home tax.  It should apply to houses vacant for six months or more within local electoral areas, LEAs, in which there is a high level of housing need and a high level of vacancy.  It would have to include exemptions for holiday homes, homes in probate, fair deal homes and so forth but it is not beyond our ability to design a scheme.  The rate would need to increase year on year.  The site tax is a similar idea to get vacant sites into use.  We are critical of the site tax the Government introduced as it left it too long, the lead-in period was too long and the rates were too low but it does increase, thereby giving an incentive to people.  Getting sites into use would be very welcome but the turnaround time would be long.  Even if an owner sold a site to a developer today, there would be a two-year lead-in period before somebody turned the key in the door.<\/p> <p>  We accept that a cohort of the 35,000 vacant properties in Dublin will not be suitable to be brought back into public or private use but a large proportion are suitable.  We need to introduce measures now as this is an emergency.  The Minister said he would come up with a report but he has already failed to meet his own targets.  Considering these matters without any clear commitments is not good enough.  I stay in a hotel in Dublin while I am here and every day I come into work I pass people who stay in the same hotel.  Every day, they get their kids ready for school, put their uniforms on and take two or three buses to get to their primary or secondary school.  What we have done to people in this State is horrible.<\/p><p>We cannot fix that overnight but this finance committee can bring in measures that would provide some light and comfort for those families.  We were elected to have the power to introduce a vacant homes tax and to encourage the 183,000 owners of those homes to bring them back into use.  Why are we not doing it?  I cannot, for the life of me, understand that.  The Minister needs to give me a good reason for not introducing a vacant home tax now.  This is not day one of the crisis - it has been going on for years.  The Minister has not given me a reason for it.  All the amendment seeks is a report.  It states: \"The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a vacant home tax.\"  It does not even commit the Minister to introducing a vacant home tax but it tries to force the Government to bring forward a report on the vacant tax for Members to have an informed discussion on the subject.<\/p><p> I would prefer the Minister of Finance to go further and say he will not tolerate 8,000 of our citizens being in emergency accommodation, or people dying on the steps of this building.  He needs to send a clear message to landlords who are hoarding empty properties that, if they do so any longer, we will tax them.  This tax should increase if they do not bring their properties into use within one year and there should be another increase after two years.  This is an emergency and it requires emergency measures but nothing of this type is coming from the Minister.  The Minister should send this message not just for the benefit of landlords, but for those who find themselves homeless in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#E00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the resources of the Revenue Commissioners are very limited so, while I agree with a lot of what was suggested by the previous speaker, unless Revenue gets the 500 extra staff it was promised I have no idea how they would be able to do such a report.  We had a report on a specific area of corporation tax which was carried out by the academic, Seamus Coffey, and I suggest something along those lines.  The data need to be collected and identified.  There is a particular problem with commercial premises across the country, where the ground floors have not reopened and the upper floors are empty.  There are complex issues with banks which are pursuing the owners of such premises but I am sure that, in many towns and cities, a significant percentage of upper floors can be utilised.  There is not much of chance of it, however, in the context of what we know of the complications with the banks.  I support the idea of a report but I do not see where the resources are to get a meaningful report that will set out the actions that could be taken to address some of the issues.<\/p> <p> In the RT&Eacute; programme earlier this week, it was very clear that, in two or three of the worst cases where there were large numbers of people, the ground floors and rears of the premises in question had been commercial premises.  Rackrenting landlords had cleared out the bottom floors and crammed in bunk beds, resulting in incredible abuse.  I ask the Minister to come back with proposals and additional staff, or to set up a commission overseen by somebody like Seamus Coffey.  The statistics from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment show that there are vacant, boarded-up premises in towns all over the country where people might want to rent them and it would be useful to do something along these lines.<\/p> <p>  I make door-to-door calls around my constituency in Dublin and I am not sure the figures reflect what is available in my constituency.

Receivers are in control and we need the data urgently.  Deputy Burton is right to identify the issue of upper floors.

I live in and represent a constituency which is afflicted by this and I represent families who are dealing with the trauma of not having a home.  I see it with my own eyes, and represent the people affected by the tragedy of not having a home or a stable roof over their heads from which they can send their children to school, in which they can cook dinner or help with the homework and where they can do all the other things families do who have their own homes.  I am well aware of the incredible distress families are facing in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I said that I take the figures for the number of children at risk from poverty in our country as seriously as the economic indicators on what is happening with bond yields or unemployment rates.  I am well aware of the challenges this poses to our economy and the unacceptable cost it imposes on society, families and on mums and dads and their children.  I am doing, and will continue to do, what I can do as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the issue and this is why, next year, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, led by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will receive an increase in resources.  It is in recognition of the fact that we have to address the issue that, in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, the Department to receive the largest increase in its share of capital funding is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p> <p>  I have said that we should move away from the State acquiring homes in the private market to building them via our local authorities and through other means.  I also want this issue to be dealt with and it is not accurate to say no action is taking place.  It is also unfair and inaccurate to say nothing is being done in relation to vacant homes.<\/p><p>I have already told the committee that by the month just gone, all local authorities in the Dublin area had to come back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with a vacant homes action plan to deal with this issue in local authorities with the powers that are available to them.  As part of that, if there were additional measures we need to consider with regard to the issues and difficulties we have on all of this, that will also be done.  <\/p><p> I will return to the amendment the Deputy has tabled.  Let me talk about the statistics that are available to us and some of the challenges those statistics generate.  For example, if we look at where we were between census 2011 and 2016, the stock of residential properties across that five-year period increased from 1.994 million to just over 2 million, which is an increase of 0.4%.  The number of vacant properties fell in that period.  It is at 183,312 units at the moment.  The number of holiday homes went up and most of the reduction in vacant properties has been in urban areas where we saw a decrease of 35,000 units.  The information available to us at the moment, which is information from the CSO, indicates that there are lower vacancy rates in the larger urban areas.  If I look at who owns those vacant properties - this moves into the issue Deputy McGrath just raised - the information we have is hard to come by but it indicates that over one third of vacant properties are owned by citizens over 60 years of age.  Potentially, the largest owner of this stock is our elderly and there are all kinds of reasons that property might not be in use.  If we look at the change I have referred to, over 105,000 of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now occupied.  Of those, more than half are now rented out.  Close to 40% are owner-occupied.  In the urban areas that I referred to a moment ago, up to 70% of the properties that were vacant in 2011 are now rented and over half of those are by families with children.  There has been a change in the number of vacant properties between then and now.  Action is being taken by Government to deal with this issue such as the action plans I referred to by county.  That information has been shared with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the past week.  <\/p><p> I will address the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy is not asking me to consider the introduction of a vacant home tax.  He is asking us to introduce a report within six months of the passing of the Bill on the introduction of such a tax.  We have many challenges in terms of understanding how many homes are vacant, why they are vacant, who owns them and for how long they have been vacant.  The challenge for me is that to give an indication that this tax will be brought in without answering all of those questions first will yield further issues and questions that would have me back before the committee pretty promptly.  I will not commit to that principle until I am clear about how I can handle those matters.<\/p><p> Deputy Burton made a fair point.  There is information, most of it from the CSO, trying to help us to understand this issue.  More work needs to be done on this by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with which I will help it.  I want to bring this work to a conclusion as soon as possible.  There are policy issues that need to be conclusively addressed to allow me to make a final assessment on whether there is a role for a vacant home tax.  Until those questions are finally answered, I cannot commit to that principle.  Where I will not yield any territory is on the commitment to ensuring the trauma of children and families in hotel rooms and those who are homeless is dealt with conclusively.  That is what I want to see happen and I will see it happen.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot commit to the principle of the introduction of this tax because there is work under way already on how the issue could be dealt with at local authority level.  There are too many matters I want to resolve before I can commit to that principle.  I want to resolve those matters.  I want to be in a position where I can come back to the Oireachtas or committee and answer conclusively the different questions being put to me regarding the information that is available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#F00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Minister pointed out to me and the committee that he is fully aware of the homelessness crisis.  I accept that, although ignorance would not be a defence anyway.  Being fully aware of it and then taking no action or not taking the appropriate action makes it even worse.  The Minister gave us figures about how many vacant homes came into use between 2011 and 2016.  During the Minister's time in Cabinet, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and now as Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the homelessness and housing crisis has gone out of control.  More children and adults are in emergency accommodation and more people are homeless and dying on our streets under the Minister's watch.  The Minister and his Government, through the decisions of Cabinet, have tolerated the homelessness crisis.  This is not an act of natural disaster.  We do not have a homelessness crisis as a result of a tsunami, an earthquake or an act of God.  We have it because of Government policies which stopped the building of social housing or did not adequately funding social housing.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will talk about the package that was given in this year's budget.  Not one single social house above the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney's targets of this time last year will be built as a result of the money the Minister has provided.

The Minister says he does not need to be lectured about it.  We do not have the luxury of waiting for another year so the Government can get its act together and start to consider the introduction of a vacant property tax.  The arguments the Minister has put before the committee border on the ridiculous.  He talks about one third of the owners of the 183,000 vacant properties being over the age of 65.  He says that might explain why they are vacant homes.  Even if we disregarded all of those owned by over-65s, we would still have 120,000 vacant properties in the State.

The Minister might not like to hear that because I am sure he has empathy for every person who finds themselves homeless but when he decides on budget day to put a particular amount into tax cuts as opposed to putting it into building new houses, the automatic result is that the family in room 401 is going to be in room 401 this time next month and for months after.  The Minister is unwilling to bring forward a report which looks at the introduction of a vacant home tax.  The Minister talks about considering it.  Although I would disagree, the report could say there is no merit in bringing forward a vacant home tax.  As a member of the Opposition, I am trying to challenge the Government years into a crisis of homelessness and housing.<\/p><p>I am trying to do so in the only way possible, namely, through the Finance Bill, because Opposition Members are not able to table amendments that would give rise to a cost on the Exchequer.  This is an attempt to force the Minister to take some action by providing certainty that within six months of the passing of the Bill, a report would be produced on the introduction of a vacant house tax.  Such a report would capture all of the issues Members have raised, whether it be the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to apply a vacant homes tax or the data to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred for probate and the different categories of individuals who own the 183,000 vacant homes.  What the Minister is telling us, however, is that it will be business as usual and that no action will be taken in the Finance Bill to introduce a vacant home tax on the 183,000 empty properties.  That is not good enough.<\/p><p> I make no apologies for telling the personal stories of homeless families, the children involved and what these families are experiencing in terms of their mental health.  I will continue to do so because I still believe the Minister simply does not get it.  We have to ask ourselves what this country has become and who we are as a nation and people.  Why do we tolerate having 8,000 homeless persons and hundreds of patients left on hospital trolleys every day?  Why do we tolerate tax avoidance on a massive scale by major corporations?  While that is the country it has become, it is not what citizens want.  They want the Government to take serious action to address the housing and homelessness crisis.  There are approximately 20 people homeless in County Donegal where the level of homelessness is nowhere near as bad as the crisis level in Dublin.  However, even people in my county who are not touched by homelessness want the problem in Dublin to be sorted.  They have empathy and sympathy and want the Government to act. <\/p><p> The measure we are seeking is not radical but a small matter of introducing a vacant home tax.  For God's sake, given that we introduced a second home tax in 2010, why can we not introduce a vacant home tax at a time when there is a housing and homelessness emergency?  The Government's refusal to do so makes no sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#G00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>We must suspend the sitting to allow members to vote in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#H00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510135200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.15 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>We are back in public session and I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#K00100","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice of support for Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment on the issue of vacant tax.  The urgency of a vacant unit or vacant home tax simply cannot be overstated.  Let me put a human face on this matter because often, when we debate financial matters, one only hears dry figures, statistics and so on.<\/p> <p>  I have a long litany of cases that people in dire circumstances bring to my office every single week.  This week, a young woman in her early 20s came to my office.  She has been homeless with her young child for two and half years.  Her child is now five and half years old.  They have been housed in eight different emergency accommodations, including the Clondalkin Sonas homeless accommodation where there was a fire.  As the Minister will know, one mother and three babies were killed due to the fire.  The young woman who came to my office had been in that hostel and she was very close friends with the woman who died.  She is completely traumatised, as is her son.  She is still in emergency accommodation.  Her son is now in his third school in two and half years.  They are utterly traumatised and they have no idea when they will be housed.  The signs are, given the state of the list operated by the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it could be years.  The woman broke down several times in my office.  She is completely unable to cope.  She blames herself, she thinks she is a terrible mother for putting her child in this situation and pleaded for a secure roof over their heads.  <\/p> <p>  Side by side with that, close to the emergency accommodation that she is in now, and I highlighted this case before but I suspect that it is the tip of the iceberg, I highlighted recently a block of apartments in Sandyford.  I refer to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally.  The apartments have been owned by NAMA since it was set up.  NAMA has sat on between 15 to 20 empty units since it took them over the loan of the developer.  Recently, NAMA sold the properties to a vulture fund that tried to evict the rest of the tenants.  All the while, between 15 and 20 apartments have been left empty while people like the young woman and her child I referred to and so many others go through a housing trauma.  Could there be anything more urgent than putting human beings, like that young mother and her child, into those empty apartments?  For ordinary people, it is as simple as that.  It is obscene that NAMA sat on those empty apartments.  It is worth saying that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approached NAMA and asked for the apartments but NAMA said no.  The apartments are still empty while there are people like the young woman I mentioned going through hell.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that we should set aside the very interesting debates on whether there are 180,000 empty units, as the CSO suggests, or a percentage of that figure.  I do not know whether the percentage is 10%, 20% or 30%.  We have to find out the correct figure, as a matter of urgency.  There are no debates about probate or anything like that but there may be a debate about what conditionality should have been put on the off-loading of NAMA assets or whether NAMA assets should ever have been off-loaded in the teeth of a housing crisis like this one.  Either way it is simply unconscionable that there are perfectly habitable empty units that people like the young woman and her child that I mentioned could live in.  Instead, she is breaking down as a human being.  The damage that has been done to her child is impossible to fathom or calculate.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried to inject urgency into this question, which I echo.  I wish to add that it is just not good enough if the Government does not move, as a matter of absolute urgency, to ensure that not a single unit that could be inhabited by people who are at the sharp end of this appalling housing emergency.  I urge that any obstacles to getting people housed in these empty units are removed, as a matter of urgency.  Whatever measures that have to be taken and whatever taxes or penalties that have to be imposed in order to get those properties for the people who need them must be taken, and they must be taken now, because we have talked about this matter for years.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is a very modest effort.  It must operate within the constraints of the Finance Bill and what we are allowed to propose.  We cannot propose things that result in a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment seeks to compel the Government to do something about the obscenity of empty units sitting side by side with human misery and human tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister to take the amendment on board and do something about this matter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#K00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Minister has already responded.

I have met families in similar circumstances and seen the anguish this has caused.  I have also heard the human stories but I am also aware of the prospects offered to people when new social accommodation is opened, for example, on the North Strand.  I am aware of the response of local communities to the opening of new sheltered housing units in Broombridge Lodge, Cabra.  I have experienced the response of people to the progress we are trying to make in O'Devanny Gardens, which includes social housing.<\/p><p>Alongside the human anguish to which Deputies referred and which I have also witnessed first-hand, I have seen the human consequences of housing solutions.  During my tenure as a member of Cabinet, we have delivered 80 housing solutions on each working day thus far in 2017 and we are aiming to increase this figure to 100.  I have provided funding to deliver our social housing targets, including the delivery by local authorities of more than 2,000 new homes, the acquisition of 1,250 homes, the delivery of 380 units through Part V acquisitions and the return to use of 1,400 vacant social homes.  This is being done as a result of the Government's commitment to address the housing issue and my commitment, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the best possible contribution to doing so.<\/p><p>In 2018, more than 3,800 social housing units will be built directly by the State and a further 4,100 social housing units will be delivered through vacant homes, acquisitions and long-term leasing arrangements.  This is part of the Government's response to the housing issue must be viewed in the context of our expectation that general housing completions will reach 24,000 next year versus 19,000 in 2017.<\/p><p>These measures are being delivered through Government and market action to increase housing supply and respond to many different challenges, including the crises to which a number of Deputies referred.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of some of the difficulties we are experiencing and the scale of the challenges we face.  He indicated he did not know the answers to some of these problems.  This is because we need to interrogate some of the figures further.  In some cases we do not have figures and we need to fix that.  The Deputy know this but his assessment is that we should proceed with the tax and make a principled commitment to introducing it, as is his right.  As Minister for Finance, however, I cannot make such a commitment until I know how much we will tax, what will be the scope of the tax and what derogations and exemptions we would need to introduce.  If we were to introduce such a tax without first addressing these issues, the Deputy would lambaste me and accuse of incompetence for not addressing them in advance.  That is how this would play out.  Introducing a tax without doing the necessary preliminary work would have consequences and I would face questions from the Deputies asking me to explain my failure to act competently, in the same way as I had to deal with issues in the previous D&aacute;il concerning the implementation of the local property tax.  Deputy Doherty raised issues with me at that time on the local property tax, which it is Sinn F&eacute;in policy to abolish.  Before making such a commitment in principle, I must first ensure certain policy matters are resolved.  A significant amount of work is being done in parallel at local authority level to convert vacant properties to use.<\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I have set out.  However, I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to rectify and address the different policy issues the Deputies have raised, for example, the issue of data collection which I genuinely need to address.  It is only when I have dealt with these matters that I will be in a position to evaluate whether this tax can be introduced.  As I stated, without doing such work, I will have to deal with the consequences of my failure to do address these issues before the tax was implemented.  Members of the Opposition would raise these consequences with me.  While I cannot accept the amendment, I will table an amendment on Report Stage outlining how the collection of data and policy matters will be crystallised.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the new section be there inserted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#LLLLL00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#LLLLL00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"vote","time":1510135200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 2; N\u00edl, 3.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#L00400","aye":["1288","1433"],"nay":["1369","1292","1328"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510135200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Staon: Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy John McGuinness.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p><blockquote>In page 20, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:&quot;<b>13.<\/b>The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the Help to Buy scheme.&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 16 deals with the help-to-buy scheme.  I would have expected that the Minister would have seen sense over the summer period and would have ended the help-to-buy scheme.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Instead, despite the fact that the scheme is costing in the region of &euro;40 million per year, the Minister has extended its use.  It is a supply-side problem and this scheme does nothing to deal with the supply-side pressures.  Before I go into any further detail on this, I ask the Minister to outline why he believes it is appropriate to continue with the help-to-buy scheme given that there is no evidence to suggest that it is meeting the intended rationale proposed by the Minister on its introduction that it was an effort to help individuals to gather the deposits required to meet the Central Bank and that it would lead to increased supply.<\/p><p>This amendment calls for the Minister, within one month of the passing of this Act, to provide a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the help-to-buy scheme.

It was done on the insistence of the Minister but with the support, through its policy of abstentionism, of Fianna F&aacute;il.

The scheme is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new build or self-build properties.<\/p> <p>  Following its introduction in budget 2017, and as a result of debate on the issue on this Stage of the Finance Bill last year, Deputies will be aware that Indecon Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake an assessment of the scheme.  The terms of reference for this review included an examination of whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.<\/p> <p>  The review was published as part of the budget documentation on 10 October.  It found that, to date, the incentive has not had a measurable effect on house prices, while it is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.<\/p><p>The report found that the supply of new homes was increasing modestly.  While the help-to-buy initiative does not appear to have had a direct impact on these supply levels to date, the report also noted it may be too early for this to have become apparent.

In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of the help-to-buy scheme.  Its reports include the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio, and property type.  It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county.<\/p><p> My Department reviews taxation measures on regularly as part of the budgetary process.

The Indecon report makes reference to that fact and says that it should not happen again.  No evaluation was carried out.  We had a big talk earlier about how homeless families could benefit, but the Minister said that he could not introduce a vacant property tax as he would need all the statistics and so on.  When it comes to putting money into developers' pockets however, the Minister just announces the measure and then carries out an evaluation a year later, an evaluation which basically says that it cannot tell whether the scheme has contributed to supply.  What it says is that \"[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability.\"  That is the key issue.<\/p> <p>  What is happening out there while the Minister is messing about with this scheme and putting &euro;40 million of taxpayers money into developers' pockets?  Let us look at the figures.  There has been a 12.8% increase in property prices over the last 12 months.  Does the Minister know where we are going?  At this point, in November of this year, we have now exceeded the property prices of 2005.  Within two years, 24 months, at the current trajectory property prices in Dublin will exceed the peak of the boom.<\/p> <p>  Let me tell the Minister what the report said again.  It said that \"[t]he Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is primarily but not exclusively a demand led measure and there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices therefore reducing any benefit in terms of mortgage affordability.\"  This is a con job.  People feel good when they get this money into their pockets but when the house they are trying to buy, in Dublin for example, at &euro;300,000 has gone up 12.8% in the last 12 months, any benefits are outstripped.  These people's mortgages will now have increased by &euro;33,000 or &euro;34,000.  To draw down &euro;34,000 over a 30-year mortgage means one has to pay back &euro;65,000.  It is a complete and utter con job.<\/p> <p>  This is not leading to supply.  The other thing which the report says is that \"[t]he HTB measure does not appear to have had any significant overall impact to date on the level of supply.\"  It has failed.  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us that this scheme was about supply.  He then told us that it was about helping people to get deposits together.  Lo and behold, a couple of weeks later the Central Bank changed the rules.  What does the report say?  It says that \"[t]here is however likely to be some purchasers who did not need the incentive suggesting an element of deadweight and particular affordability issues remain for those on lower incomes.\"  The report tells us this.  It does not give the Minister comfort to continue with this scheme.  There is no evidence that this scheme is leading to supply.  <\/p> <p>  As the report says, there is legitimate concern that it is causing inflationary pressures on property prices.  We all know, because the statistics are there in black and white, that there is what is called deadweight in the scheme.  That is to say that the vast majority of people who are availing of the help-to-buy scheme are not those who require the scheme to meet the Central Bank's deposit requirements.  Why the hell is the Minister continuing with a &euro;40 million incentive?  This money goes directly into the pockets of developers.  At a time when there are constraints on supply, additional money provided into the system increases pressures.  Those pressures result in house prices increasing.  That is why we are seeing the type of increases in house prices we have seen in recent months.  <\/p> <p>  In the last year house prices in Dublin city have gone up by 13.9%.  They are approximately 103% or 104% above the 2005 baseline.  They are 24% off the peak prices.  The Minister should remember that we are on course to return to peak property prices within two years.  This is happening.  What can we do to stop it?  There are many things which we can do, but we can focus on this scheme for now.  As the report says, \"there is legitimate concern that, in a period of inadequate supply, the measure could result in increased inflationary pressures on property prices\".  There is no reason in the world to continue this scheme.  The Minister can bluff and bluster all he wants but, as the report says, there is legitimate concern that the scheme is contributing to that 12.8% increase.  Once these increases happen, it will be very difficult to reduce them again, even when supply increases.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister is pricing many people in the Dublin market out of house ownership.  People of my generation and younger, people in their mid-20s, are telling me that they will never aspire to own a home.  It is simply beyond their reach.  These are people who are living and working in Dublin.  The opportunities which their parents had are no longer there.  They just cannot see a way forward because of current property prices.  We know where we are going.  House prices are increasing more rapidly now than ever before.  The help-to-buy scheme triggered some of that.  The Minister is continuing with a demand-side measure while there is a serious supply issue.  This does not make any sense on any level and there is nothing in the report which should tell the Minister that it does make sense at a time when house prices are increasing at the current rate and when there is inadequate supply.<\/p> <p>  I will point to one more issue, which I will come to again later as it relates to other things we must deal with in the Finance Bill.  In Dublin 50% of homes are being purchased by institutions, the Irish Real Estate Fund and so on.  They are outbidding first-time bidders.  These homes are not being bought by first-time bidders.  That is happening because in previous finance Bills the Minister incentivised those funds to snap up the very few houses which are available in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am strongly arguing that the help-to-buy scheme has no merit, that it should be immediately discontinued and, at the very least, it should be monitored in respect of its effectiveness and value for money.  I am putting the Minister on notice.  Just as the Minister is complicit in accepting and normalising homelessness because of his failure to act on a vacant house tax and to provide sufficient resources to build social housing, he is also facilitating the dramatic increase in house prices which will prevent a generation acquiring homes in areas of this city and elsewhere throughout the country.  <\/p> <p>  There is no point crying about this in a years' or in two years' time when we will all be asking how the hell we got back to peak property prices.  This is what will lead us there.  It will be because the Minister introduced a measure which was not thought out.  He commissioned a report which is inconclusive but which says that there are legitimate concerns that the scheme is a demand-side measure which is having no impact on supply and which also says there is deadweight in the scheme.  The Minister thinks that it is appropriate to continue giving &euro;40 million away on this measure.  It does not make any sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#N00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I support the amendment and agree with Deputy Doherty.<\/p><p>The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said the problem of the Government's inaction in the housing crisis has nothing to do with resources, ideology or money.  The difference in the Government's approach to the idea of vacant sites and the help-to-buy scheme indicates that is not accurate.  Ideology has much to do with it.  The resources will be found for developers but will not be found for building homes directly, which is what is needed.<\/p><p> Where did the help-to-buy scheme come from?  Who was calling for it in advance of last year's budget?  It was the Construction Industry Federation, which had it in its manifesto.  It did not do so because it thought it would resolve the housing crisis but because it would benefit its members, namely, developers, who will end up with the bulk of this &euro;40 million of public funds every year.  There is no evidence to suggest this is having a positive impact in allowing people to access homes, but the Government proposes to continue to give developers &euro;40 million a year.<\/p><p> Last year, when the scheme was first presented, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued it would increase supply.  The only way it was ever going to increase supply was by increasing prices.  Accordingly, it has created a rat race for people trying to get on the housing ladder, a race they can simply never win.  They can have the illusion of having access to money but house prices are going up beyond them, still remaining out of access.  Then the money just gets transferred to the developers.  That is what has been happening over the course of the past year.  The sum of &euro;40 million is not a small amount of money, yet the Government proposes to continue without an evidential basis.  There was no evidential basis to start it in the first place, but the Construction Industry Federation called for it and the Government did it.  A report was commissioned but there is still no evidential basis for it and the Government intends to continue with it.  It is quite incredible and it gives lie to the fact there is not an ideology behind what the Government is engaged in.  There is precisely an ideology.  It is about incentivising the private sector to deliver homes by increasing prices.  The consequences of this are more problems for ordinary people and an overheating of the property market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#N00300","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I add my support to this amendment.  The Minister said in his initial contribution that the judgment on the help-to-buy scheme would be the extent to which it did or did not contribute to a rise in house prices.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, brought out a report today which stated house prices have gone up by 12.8% in the past year.  In Dublin, in the past three months, the average house price has gone up by &euro;17,000.  Clearly, any value that the Minister might even ascribe to this measure from the point of view of the home buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular rises in house prices.  The only beneficiaries of this scheme are developers and builders.<\/p> <p>  In the early phases of the debate about the housing crisis, the cry of developers as to why they could not deliver the supply everybody said we needed was because it was not profitable for them.  There was no doubt they wanted a dramatic rise in house prices and the Government obliged.  The Government is contributing enormous sums of money through this scheme as well as through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to subsidise those who are hoarding land, manipulating prices and lobbying the Government to boost their bottom line and ensure they can make a lot of money out of the housing crisis.  The Government is being dragged by the nose by these people.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity cost to this.  Every cent the Government gives to them is money that does not go into building public housing.  It is not just a debate about whether it is effective, although clearly in its own terms it is contributing to or failing to stop the spectacular rise in house prices.  The other side of the coin is it is money that could be going into public housing.  However, the Government continues, or in the case of HBFI and LIHAF, expand corporate welfare to the very people, the builders and developers, who landed us in this mess in the first place and who, even in the teeth of this extraordinary crisis, are still manipulating it to their own advantage.  It is extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  I heard an interesting contribution at the Right2Change conference last weekend from the head of the plasterers' union about the cost of housing.  Much of what we hear about the cost of building housing is actually the propaganda coming from the builders and developers.  He helpfully pointed out that when one breaks down the cost of building a house, it is between soft costs and hard costs.  The hard cost of building a house comes in under &euro;200,000.  To physically build a house one needs bricklayers, labourers, electricians, carpenters and the other associated trades.  The other costs are the profit-taking of the developers, the estate agents, the architects, the surveyors and so on.  As he simply pointed out, those costs would not exist if the local authorities were building houses because they already employ all of these people.  Half of the cost of building a house goes to people in the private sector, whereas if they were built by local authorities we would only have the hard costs with most of the soft costs covered by existing local authority architects, surveyors and so forth.  Accordingly, much of the profit-taking would not be necessary at all.<\/p> <p>  That is the opportunity cost of the Government's approach and its ideologically dogmatic approach of believing the market will solve it when clearly the market is the problem.  Worse, the market is manipulating the situation, and yet the Government continues to feed the monster.  It is inexplicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#O00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>One of the report's recommendations is that a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the scheme should be undertaken after a period.  Given the limited time since the measure was introduced, a report inevitably can only represent a preliminary assessment and, in short, the assessment is inconclusive and it is too early to say.  The Government, to use the Taoiseach's words, is admonished for not doing an assessment in advance of introducing the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The scheme was announced in July 2016, the details were provided in the 2016 budget and it was enacted in last year's Finance Bill.  Indecon only had a short window of actual data on which to base its analysis.  What will the Minister do in a formal sense to ensure there is a proper assessment of the cost-benefit analysis of this scheme?  The measure of success for this scheme is whether it will boost supply.  Is it the Minister's view that the scheme is essential for viability to be achieved and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, for it to be profitable for builders to build houses in a commercial market, or is it already viable in the market, given the way prices have risen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#O00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.<\/p><p>It is important that we receive a detailed report on this matter.  I opposed the scheme when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, introduced it because it did what I forecast it would do.  There is no doubt that it generated interest in the housing market, particularly among younger people who wanted to buy houses before prices started to escalate and who had, perhaps, already accumulated significant savings.  In the Dublin West constituency, there are, as the Minister knows well, many houses being built.  The fact is, however, that the window through which someone in the process of buying could make a gain was less than six weeks because the builders just increased the prices dramatically when the scheme was confirmed.  Prices have been increasing ever since.<\/p><p> I appreciate that the Minister is now really caught in the cross-hairs in that it is almost impossible and extraordinarily difficult to withdraw a subsidy, particularly one relating to builders, once it is in place.  The Minister should take a deep breath, however, and determine the value of the scheme at this time.<\/p><p> A more fundamental question arises.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance is significant in this regard.  Does Fine Gael envisage that this country should be one in which it is legitimate to aspire to own one's own home?  There are those who spoke earlier who clearly believe that only local authorities should build houses.  That is a reasonable point of view but the local authorities do not want to build and several Ministers responsible for housing, including the current one, have been trying desperately to persuade them that this is the right thing to do.  For a variety of reasons, local authorities are not really engaged in building, other than in relatively small numbers and through housing associations.  Bearing in mind that we all know Dublin's inner city very well, the problem with the housing association model is that the scale of activity is too small to meet the demand.  The associations' activities are very good.  The associations can be excellent and extremely supportive, particularly of people whose personal experience or problems affect their ability to obtain a home.  If one comes through a period of homelessness, it takes time to recuperate.  It can be absolutely awful for many people.<\/p><p> I wish to focus on affordability, which is critical in the kind of democracy and society we have.  Let me use the example of a couple, perhaps in the Minister's Department, who have been working for ten to 12 years since graduating from college and who are now earning a reasonable amount of money and trying to save or, in the case of a select few, have access to the bank of mum and dad, thus allowing them to obtain some parental support.  The latter is particularly the case if one is from a middle-class family.  Parents may have valuable property, perhaps on the south side of Dublin.  How can the couple in my example afford to buy a house, particularly if they are married and have children, or want to have children, or if they are in a long-term relationship?  It is an existential question.  It may also be the case for the Minister, but I am constantly involved in conversations with people who spend entire weekends looking at new and second-hand houses in the hope they can beat the escalator that is operating at present.  The new home buyer's grant has driven this to an extent.  The Minister's predecessor wanted to send a signal to the market, and the market got its signal.  Prices were ramped up, but with no thought as to the wider social consequences.<\/p><p> Figures published recently show that the level of home ownership in Ireland is on a downward curve.  Traditionally, most people in secure employment over a long period, be they working for the council, the Government or a private company, could aspire to buying their own homes.  This trend is really under attack and the figures are sliding.  My question is a fundamental one for Fine Gael, notwithstanding all its rhetoric about ownership.  That figures are sliding is a dreadful comment on a Fine Gael-dominated and Fine Gael-led Government, and there is no sign that the slide has started to abate.<\/p><p> It is obvious, particularly in Dublin West, which is one of the largest development areas in the State and where approximately 1,000 houses are to be built at several different stages over the next three years, that land values are galloping once again.  This is where there is a problem with structure and in respect of which one must  consider actions one may be able to take and that certainly do not feature in the legislation.  There are a number of quoted property companies.  It is well worth their while, in terms of their stock market valuation, to sit on land because they are making money as they do so.  The young people we all know are locked out of being able to buy, not necessarily at a cheap price but at a favourable one that would allow them to start family life and have the security of having a home.  They will have very big mortgages but we know many families who, with two incomes, can actually manage in this regard.<\/p><p> Alongside this, there is an enormous need for social housing.  I feel very sorry for the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What capacity does he have to persuade the councils, on their own or together with housing associations, to scale up their activities in order to meet demand?  At any given time in Irish society, approximately 30% of people do not have the capacity to fund the purchase of houses, either because they are in precarious or occasional employment or as a result of the fact that they simply cannot buy a site at a reasonable price if they are in a rural area and have some capacity to self-build, perhaps with family support.<\/p><p> I have described the model that has been in place.  It was heavily ruptured by the crash and the collapse of the construction industry.  I am really interested in knowing what the Minister intends to do to restart the model.  There are many reports indicating that when NAMA offered apartments to local authorities, particularly South Dublin County Council and the others on the south side, they turned them down.  I include the councillors in this.  The apartments were turned down because, for some reason or another, a number of the areas in which they were located were not deemed to be appropriate for social or rented housing.<\/p><p> Irish history indicates that, for people on a good income, the rented housing model is not particularly sustainable.  It is a fantasy of the people writing the property pages that everybody should be happy to rent a house as they are in Germany and northern Italy.  If one rents a house in Germany or northern Italy, one can remain in it on an intergenerational basis.  Therefore, one is not turfed out if one's mother or father dies, and one can sustain the rent.  We really need to examine our models.  Could the Minister for Finance tell us a little about how the help-to-buy scheme has helped people other than those who were involved at the very beginning?<\/p><p>The initiatives the Government has taken are insufficient.  Many are very good, such as the allocation of funding, in which I was involved.  However, it is being spent far too slowly.  It is significant but I do not know what the Minister is going to do to speed up production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#O00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Did any member of this committee notice that in the budget I said \"No\" to a lower VAT rate for the construction sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#Q00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>It was a daft idea in the first place.

The same types of calls were made prior to this budget and I said \"No\".  The members accusing me of having some kind of agenda to up the margin and profitability of developers at the expense of trying to help people buy a home are either not aware of or are choosing not to bring up the fact that when I was confronted with demands for the kind of policy choice that could realise that kind of agenda, I said I was not going to do it.  I did that because I will not bring in measures that artificially increase the profitability of some parts of our economy at the expense of genuine measures that can increase supply.  Colleagues who have centred their claims regarding what I am or am not doing on the anchor that I have some kind of agenda of trying to support parts of the construction sector at the expense of increasing supply should look at the decision I made in that instance when I said I would not do it.  The reason for that was because I had no guarantee or credible assurance that it was going to increase supply, nor had I any ability to withdraw the measure if it were to be put in place and to then deal with all the difficulties that would cause, as Deputy Burton touched on a moment ago.  I knew there was a risk that if I put such a measure in place there would be no certainty of an increase in supply and no way of telling what could happen at some point in the future at huge cost to the taxpayer.  Deputies Doherty and Murphy have made all kinds of assertions about my rationale behind this measure and what I am doing but they should go back to what I decided not to do in the face of the kind of claims and arguments that won at other points in our past when this type of issue was being dealt with.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the report, what I am doing and the policy choice I have made, which is to maintain it.  I will deal with Deputy McGrath's question regarding how I will evaluate it in a moment.  The scheme is, as all members know, capped at or below just under &euro;500,000.  According to the figures published in the report I made available as part of the budget documentation, 53% of claims or draw down under the scheme are for properties priced at or below &euro;300,000.  A little more than 82% of claims are for properties valued at below &euro;375,000.  The draw down under the scheme is going towards properties we are trying to change the pricing of in order to make them more affordable for our citizens.  The figures I have shared with Deputies show that, for example, 36% of claims were for properties costing between &euro;226,000 and &euro;300,000.  That shows the scheme in its short history has been concentrated on the kind of pricing levels I want to influence and it could have the possibility to continue that in the future.<\/p> <p>  What is the central reason I have decided to maintain this scheme for another year?  I refer members to the words of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said that he wanted to have a scheme in place to try to increase supply.  Given the nature of the market I am engaging with, all members know it would take longer than 12 months or, indeed, the eight to nine months the scheme has been in operation to know if a measure to increase the supply of a particular asset, in this case housing, with all the difficulties and requirements involved in the planning process, tendering and so on, is going to have a supply side effect.  It will take longer than that.  However, those are the price ranges against which claims have been made during the operation of the scheme.  As regards the assertion that the scheme has caused the kind of price inflation we are currently experiencing, 4,487 people, families or couples have accessed the scheme to date.  That is not enough for anybody to make the claim that the scheme is shifting the needle in terms of pricing levels.  What is more likely, as, in fairness, some members have acknowledged, is that the shortage in the supply of housing is affecting the pricing levels that I want to be moderated and move into line with people's ability to afford to buy a home.  Deputy Burton asked a question on that issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty made the point that I am complicit in trying to normalise issues he believes are unacceptable.  As I have said, I want to tackle and make progress in dealing with homelessness to a greater level than we are at the moment, and deal with social issues that are unacceptable.  I hope that one of these days when the Deputy is accusing me of normalising things that I also want to change, he might acknowledge the good things that are happening in the economy in terms of job growth, changes in living standards for some people and improved investment in public services and that I have played a role in those changes.  He is entitled to the view that there are issues with which I am not dealing correctly and I would never differ with his right to hold that opinion.  However, if he believes there are policy choices I am making that are contributing to difficulties, as he does, I hope he would at least have the ability to acknowledge that it is likely there are other policy choices I am making that are contributing to improvements in our economy and society.  There is a strong case for that but I acknowledge Deputy Doherty is not willing to concede that point.  He has accused me of being complicit with developers and in their back pocket.  I have pointed to a decision I refused to make as comprehensive evidence that I am not.  Just because I have a different view to the Deputy on a matter does not mean it is bluff and bluster.  I do not accuse him of that.  I have laid out my argument and the facts available to me to back up my case.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy made reference to a CIF report and the lobbying therein.  He might also acknowledge that I did not implement the main measure the CIF and others were looking for in the budget.  I have pointed to the effect of the scheme on particular price levels.  If this is a supply side measure it is going to take longer than six to nine months to evaluate whether it is having a supply side response.  That is the basis upon which I will evaluate the scheme in the run up to budget 2019.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett holds the view, and it is a legitimate and consistent one, that the State should be building nearly all the houses our citizens need.  His view is that the private sector is not capable of doing that at pricing levels he believes are affordable for the citizens we represent.  I take a different view.  I believe the State should play a significant role in respect of the supply and regulation of houses, which is why a policy shift to local authorities building homes as opposed to acquiring them is the right policy decision to make.<\/p><p>I also believe many of our citizens want to own the assets they are going to buy.  The private sector does have a role to play in regard to the supply of homes and the State and its institutions have a role to play in regulating that market and in ensuring it is not developed at the expense of the common good.  <\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath asked how I propose to deal with this issue in the run up to the next budget.  By the time I get to the next budget I will have more evidence to help me understand whether this scheme is leading to a supply side response.  This will be one of the key factors in regard to the retention of the scheme.  I refer the Deputies to table 71 of the Indecon report, which shows that 22% of the people surveyed in the context of this report, when asked whether this scheme was likely to incentivise more units over the next three years, responded No.  The remaining 78% responded Yes.  It is, therefore, reasonable for me to wait to see if a supply side response is forthcoming in advance of budget 2019.  <\/p><p> Deputy Burton asked for my views on housing ownership.  I want to have a housing market in which more of our citizens than is currently the case are able to afford to buy homes, where home ownership is a realisable objective for the majority of our citizens and where those who wish to rent, as is the case in other European markets, are able to rent in a more stable and diverse rental sector than is currently the case.  For those citizens who are not able to do either, the Government, through the local authorities, should be building homes.  We have increased the resources available to local authorities to enable them to do that.  The Deputy made an interesting point regarding whether local authorities are accessing that funding, which is a matter I am tracking.  My experience in the past has been that they have not not been doing so.  However, as indicated as recently as this week this year the local authorities will be drawing down the funding available to them in a way that we have not seen heretofore.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#Q00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The Minister said that I did not acknowledge the positive decisions he has taken.  He is wrong.  I have acknowledged them.  I have supported many of the measures brought forward by him in this Bill, some of which I referred to when I was addressing this issue, particularly the previous measure we discussed in terms of the write-off around returning vacant homes into stock.  It is unfair of the Minister to suggest that I have not acknowledged some of the positive measures he has introduced.  That said, as Minister for Finance and a member of the Cabinet he is responsible, collectively and personally, for the decisions he has taken that have created a homelessness and housing crisis and resulted in house prices escalating at a dramatic rate.  I am hearing nothing from the Minister in terms of plans to stop this worsening.<\/p> <p>  This time last year we heard from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that house prices had increased by 8% year-on-year.  Since then house prices year-on-year have increased by 12%, which is a 50% increase.  This equates to an increase of approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month in the value of the properties, which is putting the purchase of a home beyond the reach of many people.  Taking account of current trends property prices will reach peak point in the next two years.  This means that at that time house prices in Dublin will be the same as they were in February 2007.  How are we going to deal with that?  Even if house prices do not hit peak they will still be over-valued.  A four bedroom semi-detached house in Dublin costs &euro;440,000.  A 12% increase will put that house beyond the help-to-buy scheme because it will be close to or exceed the &euro;500,000 threshold.  This is where property prices are now.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the issue of the VAT reduction and I responded that it was a daft idea.  It was a daft idea.  I do not think the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is daft.  It knows exactly what it is doing.  Of course, it would have bagged the VAT reduction if it had been agreed.  What the CIF did in this regard was a lobbying ploy.  It raised the issue at a time when the Minister was reviewing the help-to-buy scheme.  When the CIF engaged with the Department of Finance last year the first item on its agenda was the help-to-buy scheme.  Because of public pressure and because every economist worth his or her salt is saying the help-to-buy scheme is not working and it is contributing to house price inflation there was speculation that it would be abolished or significantly changed.  The response of the CIF was to make an even bigger demand - a daft demand in my view - that it knew would never be realised and Fianna F&aacute;il rowed in behind it, as it has traditionally done in terms of the construction sector.  The CIF put a little political pressure on in relation to a demand it did not believe it would get to ensure the first item on its agenda, the help-to-buy scheme, was secure and lo and behold the Minister fell for it hook, line and sinker.  When it comes to negotiations one creates demands, all of which one does not expect to be met but help to secure one's main demand.  This is as old as day itself.  That is what happened.   Does the Minister genuinely believe we should be patting him on the back for not giving in to the CIF demand for a VAT rebate?  Does he not know he was played?  He mentioned he did not agree to it because he could not guarantee it would lead to an increase in supply.  He also cannot guarantee the help-to-buy scheme will lead to an increase in supply.  I am not the only one saying that: it is also stated in the report.  The Minister said that the withdrawal of the VAT scheme would cause problems.  The withdrawal of the help-to-buy scheme will also cause problems.  The Minister also said that he cannot measure the affect of increases in supply from the VAT rebate because of the lead-in period.  The same applies in respect of the help-to-buy scheme.  It is due to expire at the end of 2019.  <\/p> <p>  There is no reason this scheme continues.  The Minister stated that draw-down is in the region of &euro;300,000.  This scheme is available not only in Dublin but across the country.  House prices in the west are increasing at a higher rate than in they are in Dublin.  House prices in the north west are increasing at a lower rate but still above the 10% rate but those house prices are not at the &euro;400,000 mark.  Average house prices in many of those counties are &euro;180,000 or &euro;190,000.  The fact that houses eligible under the scheme are in the region of &euro;226,000 to &euro;300,000 means nothing unless the Minister can say that without the scheme house prices would have been cheaper.  He cannot say that.  It is not possible for him to do so.  The help-to-buy scheme does only one thing.  I am not saying that the Minister personally is putting money into the pockets of developers.  Rather than saying something behind the Minister's back I will say it to his face.  This scheme puts money into the pockets of developers.  We are supposed to scrutinise measures in terms of their effectiveness.  In terms of effectiveness and the help-to-buy scheme the State is transferring valuable resources that could be diverted elsewhere to persons who are purchasing houses but those properties, if in the capital city, are increasing at a rate of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 per month or &euro;30,000 per year, such that benefit of the scheme is lost to them and that money ends up in the property developer's back pocket.  The Minister's only argument for the continuation of this scheme is that he did not give in to the developers on the VAT reduction.  I thought that the Minister knew what was going on in that regard.  I probably believe that the Minister did know what the CIF was doing.  I encourage the Minister to talk to people becuase everybody knows what the game plan was in terms of the VAT reduction.<\/p><p>If the Minister for Finance thinks that they were the big guys standing up to the construction sector in this, I am sorry to inform him that he was played on it because the construction sector got exactly what it wanted.  The sector got the help-to-buy scheme continued for two years at a time when the Government was wobbling and, from the soundings coming out, it was possibly going to end the scheme or significantly restructure it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#R00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I would like to add something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy McGrath to be brief as everyone has said their piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The Minister did not answer my direct question about a cost-benefit analysis.

Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Goodbody forwarded an analysis by email just a few minutes ago.  The issue of the escalating prices is accelerating.  Goodbody makes the point that following the strong monthly growth seen in July and August, prices have risen at an annualised pace of 27% in the most recent three month period.  Goodbody is raising its outlook for growth in 2017, with an increase from a forecast of 12.5% up to 15% now looking a reasonable prospect.  It is actually getting worse and is accelerating.  I am not blaming the help-to-buy scheme for all of that, and nor is Goodbody in its assessment, but the key question is what the Government is doing to bring down the cost of delivering homes.  There is general agreement that supply is the main issue, but costs and prices are rising, and home ownership is going beyond the reach of more and more people as time goes on.  These are the key issues the Minister needs to focus on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Setting aside any questioning of the Minister's motives or agendas around builders, and I do not believe that he is in any way acting as a representative of those sectors, the measure is not working on its own terms.  That is the point.  Alternatively, the money could be put where it could contribute to resolving a disastrous situation.  This is the essence.  Any benefit to the buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular growth in property prices.  The beneficiary of those increases in prices are builders and developers.  There is absolutely no question that they are the beneficiaries and are making money out of this.<\/p> <p>  As prices go up, arguably an incentive such as this or assistance for the home buyer is also encouraging them to get into an unsustainable market.  Let us remember what happened the last time.  People are being encouraged to buy houses at unsustainable prices where mortgages are gargantuan and the burden they will carry will be disastrous if further done the line we have another crash.  From any point of view, it seems that this is not working.  Contrast this with where the funding could be diverted.  This situation is not just about this particular incentive.  The package of this scheme, involving the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, home building finance Ireland, HBFI, leasing, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, are all reliant on the private sector and the market to deliver.  I have just done a quick tot and of the &euro;1.83 billion in the budget, about &euro;1 billion is going to the market in various ways to try to get the market to solve the problem.  This is a disastrous strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that in putting an alternative, our proposal is that only the State should build public housing.  Deputy Burton implied that some of us are arguing for that, but that is not what we are arguing.  We do, however, argue that there needs to be seismic shift back in that direction.  The story of the past 25 or 30 years was that the proportion of housing built by the State has dropped to negligible levels.  If, as Deputy Burton has rightly said, some 30% of people cannot purchase housing at market prices through their own resources, what does this mean?  It means the State should provide 30% of the housing.  There is no plan for that in what the Minister is doing but it is what we should be aiming at.  This is what the State used to do back in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s.  The State built that proportion of the housing stock.  The vast majority of the moneys being allocated by the Minister to resolve the problem in one scheme or another are going to the market to try to encourage and incentivise it.  I accept that the Government in Rebuilding Ireland has somewhat and in a small way shifted, although mostly at the level of rhetoric, to saying that Ireland needs public housing.  Rebuilding Ireland is still relying overwhelmingly on the market and I do not believe it can deliver.  In so far as it may increase supply, it is going to do so at unaffordable prices.<\/p> <p>  We need a dramatic shift in where the State puts its resources.  Let the market look after the market.  People who want to purchase their own homes, and I accept that it is the majority, are not able to purchase now because the prices in the market have gone out of control.  They would also benefit.  I underline this point, particularly given the offensive rhetoric from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - not from the Minister for Finance in fairness - about \"free housing\".  The implication was that social housing is free.  Social housing is not free.  People pay rent according to their income.  The point is that a person can get a house and pay according to his or her ability.  The Taoiseach's comments about \"free housing\" suggest that those people who want council housing or who advocate for social housing are advocating free housing, as against people who pay for their housing.  That is absolutely offensive.  It indicates a certain mindset, which needs to shift.  I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe shares that mindset, but I believe that he shares the ideological blinkers that have been put on governments because of the shift towards neoliberal thinking that has dominated for the past 25 to 30 years.  I urge the Minister for Finance to take off those blinkers and recognise that the only way Ireland can provide affordable housing is to get back up to 30% of housing being built directly by the State.  This would also stabilise, or bring down, house prices in the private market.<\/p> <p>  If the Government wants to bring prices down for the ordinary home buyer, it should build more council houses.  That is how it could stabilise the market.  When we give more and more incentives to developers to solve the problem, they will just use them, manipulate them and profiteer from them.  They will land hoard and release supply only when it suits them and they can make money.  They will stop the supply when they think it does not suit and when they cannot make enough money.  This is our point.  The signs are on it when we consider the experience of the past ten years, or even what has happened in the past year or two.  This is what is happening.  The Minister should consider taking on board the points we are making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#S00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>The Minister has to face the facts.

That applies to councils which are building, organisations which are building houses for rent and the private sector.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding all of the money being pumped in which ought to be sufficient to address the crisis, there is a failure of market regulation.  I would be the first to acknowledge that regulating the building market is intensely difficult.  It means dealing with very diverse individuals and much of the market is still only recovering from the crash, particularly for smaller and medium-sized builders.  We are talking about the perfect storm.  The industry is not even bothering to train apprentices.  In three years we will be crying out to have people brought here from other countries to build the houses we will still need.  The actions taken are not near adequate.  In that context, the proposed amendment is extremely modest.  It would provide for ongoing reporting on effectiveness and value for money achieved and the manner in which they will be monitored.  The Minister for Finance has a key power when it comes to oversight and monitoring.  I draw his attention to one element of the market that is causing huge problems in Dublin.  Because of the extraordinary increase in the price of housing land, for those involved in the provision of finance capital through companies on the Stock Exchange, bank investment or other investment vehicles, it is highly profitable to sit on land and do nothing.  That is not acceptable.  We know that there are delays in providing road and bridge access and so on.  However, there are also people who are consciously sitting on land and because of this the pace of development is being slowed down.  The value of so many portfolios is being elevated by the surge in land values and house prices.  The Minister really does have to act.

These amendments are necessary to ensure that EII is compatible with the General Block Exemption Regulation, GBER.  Under GBER, countries cannot give aid to individuals to invest in a company of which they are already a shareholder.  The GBER requirement has applied since October 2015.<\/p><p>The amendments I am proposing provides that a person who has a shareholding in a company, or whose relative has a shareholding in a company, may, from 2 November 2017, no longer claim relief under EII for an investment in that company.  This restriction will not apply if an individual and his or her relatives make their investments in the company while it is still at very initial stages before it commences any of its activities.  I should also emphasise that this restriction will not apply where an individual is only connected with a company through a prior investment to which EII relief applied.  Some &euro;30 million in relief is provided to investors under the scheme each year.  The value of relief affected by this change was in the order of &euro;6 million to &euro;10 million per annum.

I say that because it is important to get to the core of this.  This was the major argument in the Finance Bill last year.  The Minister of State should look over the transcripts.  We kept going back over this on Committee and Report Stages.  We argued with the Government at the time that the five-year exemption from dividend withholding tax was a loophole that it was deliberately putting into the Finance Bill.  I argued very strongly that people who bought properties not just last year, but four years from then, could have no dividend withholding tax from the capital gains tax, CGT, payable.  This was a major issue.<\/p> <p>  Following up on that through a freedom of information request, I found that officials were communicating the fact that this could lead to hoarding before this measure was introduced to the Finance Bill and signed off.  We were unaware that there were those concerns within the Department, but we were still making the argument that this would lead to an escape from huge amounts of tax and have an effect on the property market.<\/p> <p>  I put forward the idea in the first place for a dividend witholding tax and I have campaigned vigorously to end the five-year CGT exemption, which is an incentive that makes it more profitable for funds to hold onto vacant lands for a period of five years than to sell them off.  The reason it is more profitable is that the Government argued black and blue with me, and with others in this committee, that that was the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>  It is not about circumstances, CGT, stamp duty and all the rest.  The Government got this seriously wrong.  There was a bit of arrogance last year on this issue.  THe Government would not listen to members of the Opposition who were pointing out the problems there at that time.  I welcome the fact the five-year CGT exemption or the dividend witholding tax exemption is going to be gone.  However, there is a lesson here.  We can talk about new politics and all the rest.  It is not a case of saying that we were right and the Government was wrong; this has caused damage at this point.  There are properties that could have been sold in bloc format, the way properties were sold by NAMA to investors, that have not been sold.  This is because it was more beneficial for them to hold on and avail of the five-year CGT exemption.  Those properties are in this city.  This is something the Government was aware of during that time, but it continued to march on with this ill-conceived idea.<\/p> <p>  We are closing a loophole, but I am not sure who applied the pressure.  I am sure certain people lobbied.  I would like the Minister of State to put on record whether there was any lobbying of the Department of Finance on introducing the five-year CGT exemption on dividend withholding tax, or the dividend witholding tax exemption.

The theory was that by giving vast tax breaks to these investors, we would do something positive for the market.  What we actually did was hand over vast wealth to these vulture funds.<\/p> <p>  It was obviously a concerted strategy.  In fact, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was straight-up about it.  We now know he was busy meeting representatives from all these funds and actively encouraging them to come in.  No doubt, he was telling them they would get favourable tax treatment and that they would walk away paying no tax on the capital gains, which, we now know, are absolutely astronomical.  Even then, it would not have taken a rocket scientist to know that when the market was bottomed out these people were going to gain in a major way.

Some of us at the time were saying that NAMA should have behaved differently.  This might indeed explain the mystery of a case I brought up with the Minister for Finance earlier.  It related to apartments in Sandyford.  In that case, NAMA was sitting on empty properties and then sold them to a vulture fund.  The vulture fund then sat on the empty properties while there were homeless people all around.  It is a mystery.  Why was this happening?  Perhaps it was for precisely this reason: the decision was to simply sit on the property and let the value go up.  Then, the owners would walk away with a vast capital gain and pay no tax on it.<\/p> <p>  The Government is not moving immediately to close that down and is allowing it to play out.

It is a little like what I suspect also happened with Apple &ndash; we will move on to that discussion later.  In those critical years of 2013 and 2014, a great deal of running around was done by the then Minister.

These funds moved in and the consequences have been disastrous.<\/p> <p>  The Government has somewhat belatedly acknowledged this by making some moves to close down the loophole.  However, it seems to be extending it for one year because of some sort of principle of honour or because we have to honour the deal with these vulture funds.  The Government should forget it.

Many members have a different experience.  We should remember that many of the vulture funds in question have no plans to reinvest here and are in it for the short term.  A well-known maxim is that when there is blood spilled on the floor, it is time to go in.  That is what happened here.  The quantum of money we would lose in tax is a scandal, as is the fact this is holding up potential housing development at a time of emergency in that area.  However, that should be considered in light of what the funds have been achieving over that period of time.  Funds that invested in the period around 2013 will now benefit from the CGT exemption.  In 2014, commercial property returns in the State were the highest in the world.  There was a return of 40.1% on commercial property in 2014 because in 2012 the economy started to pick up and in 2013, it was already back on a growth trajectory.  That is why I say it was close to the bottom of the trough.  The Minister of State has said we needed the funds and all the rest and nobody knew what way it was going to go.  He should read any academic analysis of the situation such as that of Morgan Kelly or the NAMA report that led to its establishment and which foresaw property prices getting back to a sustainable level within ten years.  That was all well signalled and the funds knew that.<\/p> <p>  We can argue about whether we needed them.  I am not sure what benefit they supplied.  They snapped up properties from NAMA at rock bottom prices and made massive profits running to billions of euro on them.  They paid no taxes on those profits and the Government is now going to facilitate them further in paying no tax on profits.  Can the Minister of State tell me or anybody listening to these proceedings why the State needed them?  What benefit did they give the State?  The only benefit is their shareholders became extremely rich.  The companies that serviced the funds' legal structures got quite wealthy.  However, the funds did not service the interests of the State.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain how Irish citizens benefitted from vulture funds coming in and buying from the State, through NAMA, at rock bottom prices, flipping those properties within a short period of time for, in some cases, double, triple or quadruple the price for which they bought them and in other cases holding the assets in order that they can leave Ireland without paying tax.

Before lunch I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the fact that increases in land values are giving people involved in funds a perverse incentive to sit on lands while such increases continue.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of this problem, which is being discussed widely.  Regardless of whether we are ultimately talking about fund valuations or something like a limited company - I appreciate that different structures are involved - there continues to be a perverse incentive to make gains and see valuations rise by sitting on lands.  I have significant concerns about the current tendency of various entities to sit on land at a time of remarkable speculation in land prompted by substantial increases in property values.  At a time of severe housing shortages - I refer not only to affordable and social housing but also to houses for purchase - this country cannot afford to have people hoarding and sitting on land for the purpose of accumulating valuation increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#HH00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I would like to add a further point to those that have already been made.  The current approach offers an incentive to evict people.  These capital gains tax breaks incentivise funds to evict people and they are acting on those incentives.  When they evict people, the value of the property increases.  This is what the funds are doing.  I am dealing with a property in my area that has been bought by one of these funds - I am not sure of the exact year, but I am almost certain it would have been in the period in question - which is evicting people in order to drive up the value of the property.  To my mind, that is another outrageous consequence of these tax breaks.  We are incentivising these funds to increase their capital gains before walking away tax-free.<\/p> <p>  I have another question that I would like the Minister of State to answer, although I suspect that he cannot or will not do so.

The Government was able to introduce it immediately, but now that it is being withdrawn it seems that a certain amount of time must be provided in the interests of having an environment of tax certainty.  The Government and the D&aacute;il are entitled to change legislation.  We are not talking about a retrospective measure here.  We have a right to change the tax code.  There seems to be a suggestion that the Government should be blackmailed because it has, in effect, promised these funds that they will not pay tax.

In response to this, a targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging regime.  This scheme has been in place since the introduction of farm taxation.  It provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out the income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  In effect, one fifth of the farmer&rsquo;s profits and losses for the five years is charged for a year.<\/p> <p>  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility, my Department sought to introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to reflect this new reality and to maximise the number of farmers who can level out volatile incomes through the averaging system.  In the Finance Act 2014, the availability of income averaging was extended to permit farmers in receipt of income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession to elect into the averaging regime.  The period of income averaging was also extended from three to five years, thereby providing a longer timeframe over which income volatility can be smoothed.  In the Finance Act 2016, an optional so-called step-out from the regime was introduced for farmers to ease financial pressures and improve cashflow for farmers in a year when they experience lower than expected incomes.<\/p> <p>  In addition, following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed, I have committed to continuing our engagement on exploring further taxation measures for income stabilisation and undertaking a review of agricultural tax incentives more generally in advance of budget 2019.  This will include an examination of existing schemes, including income volatility measures, as well as engagement with relevant stakeholders.  The aim of the review will be to ensure that these schemes are operating in an efficient and effective manner and meeting their policy objectives in this area.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, on the basis that there is already a targeted tax measure available to full-time farmers under the income averaging regime and considering that I have already committed to undertake a review of agricultural taxes more broadly prior to budget 2019, I do not propose to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#PP00100","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510135200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness resumed the Chair at 4.31 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>To clarify, what specifically will the review cover which the Minister of State has committed to undertake?

That amendment is no longer being pressed as a result of the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption for non-resident investors in Irish real estate funds, IREFs, now being dealt with in the previous section.<\/p><p>There are a number of amendments in this grouping.  To keep the debate focused, we should try to deal with them individually.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a report to be laid before the D&aacute;il within six months of the passing of the Act on the ability of certain investors in IREFs, including pension funds and other investment funds, to neutralise their tax liability in respect of either incomes or gains from Irish property held by such funds.  This leads on from the conversations we had earlier in public and private sessions of the committee in respect of the make-up of a certain number of IREFs.  Some would have a large involvement in pensions, both Irish and European institutional pension schemes and investors.  We know that, as a result, pension funds investing in IREFs are able to avail of not paying any tax.  We need to deal with that.  I am asking that a report be brought forward on the options in dealing with it.  Certain investors in IREFs, including pensions funds and international investors, can pay no income, corporation or capital gains tax on their income or gains from Irish property.  Many feel that this is simply wrong.<\/p><p>For example, the IPUT fund has Irish property assets of &euro;2.2 billion.  AIB recently signed a 20 year lease with this fund, which is moving in from Ballsbridge to AIB's corporate headquarters in the centre of Dublin in 2019.  The group's contracted annual rental return for 2017 is expected to be &euro;102 million.  However, 79% of this fund is owned by pension funds and institutional investors, meaning that the vast majority of its incomes and gains are not subject to taxation.  That is a major gap.  The fund has &euro;2.2 billion in Irish property assets and a rental book of &euro;102 million, yet 79% of its gains and income is not subject to Irish taxation.  This goes back to the point about taxing property and the rights here in terms of such taxation and the benefits that arise from property.<\/p><p>We can look at these funds and examine who really benefits.  Certain individuals benefit from them.  The lawyers obviously benefit from the structures that are put in place.  In terms of the number of staff this fund has, which one would think would be quite large given the turnover in annual rental income and assets of &euro;2.2 billion, it employed 19 people in 2016.  If we were to look at their pay bill, we would say it was large at &euro;5.3 million.  The average cost per employee is therefore about &euro;279,000 per year.  Certainly, they can afford to pay wages of that scale.  The vast majority of the income and profits they are recording is not taxable.  In respect of institutional investors, Irish institutional pension schemes make up 42% of the fund.  European institutional investors make up 37% of it.  Then we have Irish investment managers at 17% and Irish charities and universities at 4%.<\/p><p>I do not believe that is a healthy way to go forward.  We need to consider issuing a report on how and whether we can bring in measures that would see an appropriate level of taxation of some of these funds, which would have within them investments from pension schemes and other institutional investors that are not subject to tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#PP01200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Section 23 of the Finance Act 2016 introduced a new tax regime for funds that hold Irish real estate, to be known as Irish real estate funds, IREFs.  The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property.  Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%.  Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax Acts.  The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy&rsquo;s point in relation to pension funds and investment undertakings, I note that these entities are investment vehicles.  As such, they do not pay tax on the profits generated within the vehicle.  Tax is instead operated at the time that the investor, be it the pensioner or the unit holder, draws a benefit down from the pension fund or investment undertaking.  Pension funds and investment undertakings are, therefore, among a class of investors that can make a declaration that IREF withholding tax does not arise.  This is on the basis that the profits will ultimately be taxed at the investor level.  I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from Irish real estate funds will be filed in the middle of next year.  At that point, Revenue will examine the IREF taxable events in respect of which IREF withholding tax could have applied and identify reasons why such withholding tax was not operated.  If any areas of concern are identified, these will be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the IREF withholding tax exemption for gains on assets held in an IREF for more than five years, as we have discussed, I have brought forward an amendment such that it will not apply to disposals on or after 1 January 2019.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced by the Finance Act 2013.  The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property.  REITs must be widely held, as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a close company, that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer participators.  A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property.  No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT.  The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.<\/p> <p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible to share the information sought by the Deputy with the committee, or indeed with myself.  However, I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division has a dedicated team which looks after REITs.  As the REIT regime was introduced in Finance Act 2013 that team is, as part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies.  Should any issues arise from that review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials.<\/p> <p>  I cannot commend the amendments to the committee, but I assure the Deputies that both the IREFs and REITs are being kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#QQ00100","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I will only discuss amendment No. 22 as I do not want to mix up REITs and IREFs.

The total value of Irish property within these funds is between &euro;18 billion and &euro;19 billion.  The CSO has revealed that non-household buyers, a large proportion of which comprise REITs and IREFs, had purchased 42% of new homes in Dublin by the end of July 2017.  In the middle of this housing crisis, with people queuing up for houses and being outbid for them, non-household buyers are buying 42% of available properties in Dublin.  First-time buyers only make up 25% of the market and are competing with these multibillion euro funds.<\/p><p>It should be remembered that there are only 100 IREFs and three REITs.  As such, 103 companies have &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion worth of fire-power.  That is the level of assets they have in their structures and they are out there competing with Mary and John who are trying to get onto the property ladder but who are being outbid all the time.  There is a reason for that.  The tax code provides a very lucrative arrangement for these funds, which allows them to outbid others.<\/p><p> While most of the focus of these funds is in Dublin, we see nationally that non-household buyers purchased 13% of all homes in the State in 2016.  When one isolates local authorities and approved housing bodies from the figures, one finds that, within this category, 10% can be attributed predominantly to REITs and IREFs.  As such, 10% of all homes across the State were purchased by REITs or IREFs.  The 2017 figure nationally will be ahead of that.  It is a disgrace that these tax avoidance structures are pushing up prices through the demand of the funds for property.  They have the fire-power to buy up huge tranches of housing, which results in many ordinary people being unable to even dream of owning their own homes.  We have to change the tax structures within these funds.  Whatever the argument was about the need for vultures in 2013, it is no longer that point in time.<\/p><p> We have a huge problem with regard to housing supply and the last thing we should do as a Parliament is unleash these tax effective or avoiding structures onto first-time buyers in the market.  They do not have a clue what is happening.  Many of them are oblivious to what we are doing in this committee but we have passed the legislation to set up the tax structures which are now competing with ordinary Dubliners and people in Donegal for first-time houses.  That is why property prices are increasing by 12.8% nationally and by higher rates in certain categories in Dublin city in particular.  It is not all attributable to that but going back to the statistics, 42% of houses bought in Dublin to the end of July 2017 were bought by non-household buyers.  Non-household buyers include a number of cohorts, namely, REITs, IREFs, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  When we isolate the national figure of 13% and take away local authorities and approved housing bodies, 10% involves REITs and IREFs.<\/p><p> This proposal is looking for a report on the impact IREFs and REITs are having on residential property prices in the State.  This is required urgently.  I have suggested six months to be consistent with the timeframe in terms of the reports, but it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  What is going on in the Dublin market is crazy.  This is not just coming from the left.  Economists and big firms are calling for penalties on cash buyers and non-household buyers.  There is a time for intervention.  When these non-household buyers are buying up nearly twice as much of the Dublin property market in domestic homes as first-time buyers, the time for action is long past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#QQ01000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>On the point that non-household buyers have increased significantly, the CSO has clarified that this classification is made up of three broad categories, namely, State and semi-State bodies, charitable, religious and approved housing bodies and private companies, which are the REITs and investment funds.  It is the CSO's intention to publish a breakdown of these figures into the three categories shortly.  However, it is likely to be March 2018 at the earliest before it has any actual figures.  At that stage, we will have the information to do the analysis.  There are three REITs operating in the Irish market, of which two are active in the residential market.  IRES has approximately 2,400 apartments, while Hibernia has just over 300 apartments.  The rationale behind the introduction of the REITs was their design specifically for long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to be a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  The REIT regime brought a new source of capital into the market, reducing dependence on banking finance and freeing up available banking finance for other uses.  By facilitating collective investment, REITs also provide risk diversification for investors of all sizes to promote the professionalisation of the Irish property market.  They are also key to the development of a build-to-rent market in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I hear what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying.  We can all have our ideological debates but all parties across both Houses want to try to improve the housing situation for everyone.  We will not have the information back from Revenue until next July or thereabouts.  As such, we have an information vacuum at this moment in time.  To put this in context, there are 2 million homes in the country.  It is difficult to pluck a figure from the sky, but if we suggest an average price of &euro;250,000 per home, that is a residential value of &euro;500 billion, excluding commercial property.  If one adds commercial property, it is impossible for me to put a figure on it.  REITs and IREFs have assets of &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion.  They have given investors, including pension funds, the opportunity to make a tax-efficient investment.  There is a serious problem, as the Deputy well knows, for Irish pension funds into the future.  He mentioned one in particular.  For each one, there are many thousands of small investors who are trying hard to have a pot for when they retire.  It has not been easy.  Again, we can have an ideological debate about whether it should be allowed at the higher rate, but for the vast majority of people, these are tax-efficient methods for investing.  At &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion, it gives smaller investors the opportunity to be tax efficient.  They do not have to be at a scale which puts them into a very wealthy person's space.  In the scheme of a property sector worth perhaps &euro;500 billion for residential and whatever the value of commercial property is, &euro;18 billion or &euro;19 billion is not a huge amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#RR00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I want to focus for a moment on REITs, which file an annual return by the end of February.

Our friends, PwC, in their document Irish Real Estate Investment Structures, say:<\/p><blockquote>[There has been a] remarkable resurgence of interest in ... Irish real estate ... spearheaded by overseas investors [not little Irish pensioners trying to save up for their pension pots] and in particular by the hedge funds and private equity groups.

Regarding section 110 companies, it states, &quot;While such entities are taxable at a rate of 25%, the taxable profits tend to be modest because of the use of tax efficient profit ... mechanisms such as interest ... on profit participating loans.&quot;  It goes on and on.  What PwC is touting is the fact that this is an array of structures which allows the mitigation or complete elimination of the profits extracted from the Irish property sector, much of them courtesy of NAMA, which flogged this property - our property - to these buyers in order for them to extract profit and pay no tax.  This is the greatest scandal this State has seen in recent times.  As if everything that happened in 2007 and 2008 and the cost that people paid were not bad enough, that then became the prelude to the vast unloading of property assets to foreign investors, hedge funds and so on, which then extract an absolutely enormous profit from this and pay no tax.

I had a problem with the way in which the Department of Finance is implementing and addressing the Act in that what I understand now happens is that general letters are written, which are received by low-level officials, who are not designated officials.  The then Minister indicated to me - others might remember part of the discussion on the Finance Act - that he was minded to address any difficulties, but I am not aware of anything being done over the past year to address an obvious gap in the legislation.  Who at this point in time is a designated official in the Department or the Revenue Commissioners, and at what level are they in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, for the purposes of the Regulation of Lobbying Act?

We can get this information, although it will not be as accurate as what Revenue will provide in March following its analysis.  We know what local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, have bought.  If we strip them out, we find that the figure has not reduced substantially.  REITS and IREFs are hoovering up the market and, consequently, pushing up prices.  We want the Minister of State to understand the problem in the first place and to get with it.  We have unleashed these fund structures onto unassuming first-time buyers whom they are outbidding in the market.<\/p> <p>  This is not just coming from the left.<\/p><p>Merrion stockbrokers said the Government should consider penalising property investors to stop first-time buyers being priced out of the market.  In its latest quarterly economic outlook, the broker says those who want a house to live in should be given precedence over those who are in it for purely investment purposes and looking to make a quick buck.  Investors are the main drivers of cash sales in the Irish property market, which account for more than 50% of transactions.  In its report, Merrion stockbrokers warned there was now a shortage of every type of housing and that the crisis was likely to get worse unless urgent action was taken.  With regard to the REITs, the tax efficient structures the Minister of State talks about, one has set new record monthly rents of &euro;2,570 in its Maple scheme in Dublin despite the tax incentive structure that it has.  It is not right.  I could use stronger language.  The fund is not in it to provide houses; that is a by-product of what they are doing.  They are in it to ensure they maximise the returns for their investors.  Our focus needs to be on Irish citizens.  We have evidence, which will undoubtedly become clearer in a number of months, that we will still see these types of structures out-purchasing first-time buyers in Dublin when we strip everything else out of it.  That is an issue.  Even if the figures were reduced to 30% instead of 42%, it will still be an issue.  We have to stop this.  If there was plenty of supply, there would not be a problem.  I would like to see penalties; I support what Merrion stockbrokers said.  The amendment is very clear.  It asks for \"a report on the impact that Irish Real Estate Funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts are having on residential property prices in the State\".  It is to be done within six months.  Revenue will have figures for us in March.  If the Government wants to extend that to eight months, we will do it on Report Stage, but there should be a report done on this because it is a major issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#TT04300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UU00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I am hoping to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UU00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I want to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UU00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State accepting the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UU00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman allow me to respond first?

It deducts property taxes of &euro;581,000, which is not a huge amount, but no other landlord in the State would be able to deduct their property tax before taxation.  Deputy McGrath has raised this on numerous occasions during different Finance Bills.  It deducts asset management fees of &euro;2.7 million.  This is on top of property operating costs of &euro;7.6 million.  There is a real suspicion that this asset management fee should not be deducted.

I have looked at the three REITs in the State and their annual reports and accounts for 2016 and 2017.  Their annual reports for 2016 showed they had a combined value of &euro;2.637 billion.

It has meant that many private sector pension funds have gone out of existence.  I want to know if in the context of this change over the Minister or his Department has given any consideration to changing any of the accounting treatments in order to make provision for greater protection of defined benefit schemes in particular.  The system of accounting has inevitably led to the demise of a vast number of pension funds in private firms, in fact, there have been many different treatments.  In the case of Clerys, one thing that happened was the owners tried to rid themselves of pension liabilities.  In this context, does the Minister or anyone in his Department have any proposals to address this?  For people in the public sector or who are funded by the public sector, there is a system where people who are currently working are paying for the pensions of those who will retire in subsequent generations which means that the pensions are much more secure.  The same applies to the social insurance system where current contributors pay towards the State retirement pensions of people who have retired.  <\/p> <p>  Will any examination be carried out by the State of the implications particularly for pension funds which have caused enormous disruption in the way that they have been dealt with in the past.

This is probably the most difficult and certainly one of the most contentious issues in the field of accounting nationally and internationally because what has happened is that the accounting treatments have meant that many companies approach development and possible consolidation and other issues by seeking to limit liabilities in respect of pensions and do away with them altogether.  The consequence is that not just in Ireland but in many other countries workers end up losing their pensions.  I accept there is to be a review, however, I think it is very important particularly in the context of European standards that the provisioning and the accounting treatments of pensions should be looked at.  Clearly from the narrow view of a company, it may be simply about the company getting rid of the pension fund liabilities and it may become much more profitable, but there are social and economic consequences to a society where people do not have pensions.

These rules were devised when the banks were mired in massive losses and there was not an optimistic view as to how quickly they might return to profitability.  The banks are now returning to profitability and will possibly return to very significant profitability into the future.  It is interesting that this is being done.  It shows that there is flexibility in the Department of Finance to address issues but not in the context of the future significant profits of the banks that were bailed out in terms of the indefinite carrying forward of losses.

Essentially, these schemes involve converting what should be taxable income payments into capital payments to avail of the lower capital gains tax rates.  The potential charge to capital gains tax is then often avoided by the use of CGT reliefs such as retirement relief and entrepreneurial relief, resulting in funds being extracted by shareholders entirely tax free or at a significantly reduced tax liability.  It is unfair that some individuals are engaging in these tax avoidance structures solely to take advantage of lower tax rates.  This leads to unfair outcomes and puts other taxpayers who do not engage in such avoidance arrangements at a competitive disadvantage.  I am, therefore, taking steps to counter these avoidance schemes.<\/p><p>I am amending the distribution rules in section 135 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for determining whether an amount is to be treated as a distribution of income for tax purposes.  The first amendment deals with a scheme which has been exploited by taxpayers in order to generate new capital in a company, without investing any fresh capital, so as to enable income to be turned into capital on a subsequent repayment of the share capital.  The distribution rules are being amended to ensure that any artificially generated capital will be properly subject to income tax when it is subsequently distributed to shareholders. <\/p><p>The second amendment to section 135 deals with another scheme identified by Revenue, which seeks to avoid a liability to income tax where a company indirectly buys back shares from a shareholder.  The provisions are being amended to ensure that distribution treatment correctly applies.<\/p><p>I am also bringing forward proposals to amend the capital gains tax provisions in order to restrict the availability of CGT relief in respect of certain connected party transactions by individuals.  This follows the identification by Revenue of three specific avoidance schemes in operation involving the disposal of assets to connected parties by individuals, without any change in the underlying beneficial ownership of the asset, in order to extract cash from a business in a tax free manner.<\/p><p>I am therefore restricting the availability of retirement relief and the revised entrepreneur relief in respect of such connected party transactions.  In addition, an amendment is being introduced in relation to inter-family disposals of shares and securities to ensure that the maximum tax-free threshold, which is laid down in the legislation, cannot be circumvented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#FFF02200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I have a question on the new section.<\/p> <p>  In respect of anti-avoidance, in the context of the Paradise Papers that are being revealed every day, although it is early days yet has the Minister any indication from Revenue that it needs to strengthen its anti-avoidance powers to deal with transactions or tax structures which, in its view, are designed to reduce or eliminate a tax liability in the State in the context of offshore activity?

I welcomed the pre-2014 position.  I will go into details in terms of the motivation for the changes at that time.  It is my view that this should apply from now, and to capital allowances that have been onshored in the past number of years.  The Minister is of the view that the cap applies to capital expenditure incurred by a company on or after 11 October 2017.  I understand it is a policy choice, that there is no legal reason the Minister has to do this.<\/p> <p>  It is only fair to acknowledge the sterling work that Mr. Seamus Coffey has done on this in his report on corporation tax that was commissioned by the Minister following last year's budget.  I am sure the Minister has read the report.  Mr. Coffey wrote a blog which detailed the amount of revenue that has been lost and that will be lost in this tax year as a result of the measure the Minister is introducing only applying from 11 October this year.  Mr. Coffey argues strongly that there is no reason for that to be the case.  He makes the point that if the Minister did not apply this grandfathering effect, the amount of revenue that could be collected in 2018 would be &euro;1 billion as opposed to the &euro;150 million the Government is expecting.  Mr. Coffey also draws attention to the fact that the onshoring of these assets, mostly intellectual property, has resulted in increasing our GNI, which, as a result, has increased our contribution to the European Union, and the portion of the increase resulting from the onshoring of these assets equates to &euro;200 million.  He makes the easy calculation that in ten years we will pay approximately &euro;2 billion more to the European Union as a result of the onshoring of these assets and the conclusion being drawn is that we will not be taxing these during this period.  I am sure the Minister will say that this is deferred tax etc., but that is not necessarily the case.  That is only the case if the companies still exist in their current tax structure form at the point when all of these capital allowances are used up.  There is no certainty whatsoever that many of these highly mobile companies will have the same structure at that point in time and, therefore, will pay an increased level of taxes.  There are a number of companies that we could look at which have left these shores in the past, and that is where the Minister could get seriously caught out.  I cannot understand why when the author of the report, although he has not called for that, has made it clear that he sees no reason.  He makes it clear that if there are other companies willing to come here and if the Department expects &euro;150 million to be recouped from this then obviously people are still willing to come and invest in us.<\/p> <p>  Second, I have deep suspicions, as I said on budget night, about how this happened.  Before the Paradise Papers were released, I had serious concerns about how this happened.  The Paradise Papers only strengthen my suspicions.  The history of it is that in 2013, in the Finance Bill, the Government decided to end the stateless status following huge international pressure.  I, myself, was pursuing the Minister's predecessor with regard to this issue about stateless companies.  He kept on denying that we had the ability to end it.  I wrote legislation and pointed out the provision in the Act that needed to be changed.  That is exactly what happened in the Finance Bill in 2013 but, crucially, the effect of this only came into effect over a year later, on 1 January 2015.  Then we had the double Irish, which was closed down in the Finance Bill of 2014.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, told us that this was a mismatch between two tax codes, which is technically true, that we did not have the ability to close it down unilaterally, and that the only problem with the double Irish was that it had \"Irish\" in its name - that was the phrase the former Minister used on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Lo and behold, as a result of pressure, international and domestic, we had the double Irish closed down.  As the Government closed down that loophole, however, it made a conscious decision to change how capital allowances could be written off against profits.  Up until then, a level of profits could not be written off as capital allowances - it was 20% and 80% was the threshold - but the Government decided to increase it to 100%.  The Government knew that as a result of changing the residency status within our tax codes there would be onshoring of intellectual property, IP.  We now know what happened.  We see, from the 26% growth rate and so-called leprechaun economics, that hundreds of billions of euro worth of intellectual property was onshored in the State.<\/p><p> We now know from the Paradise Papers that during that period when the Government was ending the stateless rule - when we questioned the Minister on this we were told that to his knowledge only three companies were stateless - that of the three Apple subsidiaries based in Cork that has no tax residency here or anywhere in the world, two ended up in Jersey and one became an Irish resident company.  One of the Jersey companies, Apple Sales International, ASI, which had the rights to the intellectual property of Apple which was worth about &euro;170 billion sold those rights to Apple Operations Europe, AOE, which is the Irish resident company, and as a result of that it is able to use its capital allowances to write off against any profits in this State for a long period.  <\/p><p> How does this affect us?  Apple confirmed yesterday that all sales outside of the Americas are being registered through an Irish company in Cork.  The value of those sales is &euro;119 billion.  Apple confirmed that.  That was the same position prior to 2015 when we ended the stateless designation of those companies.  In 2014 they were stateless and had no tax residency so even though all this money went through a company which recorded a turnover or sales of &euro;119 billion they did not have to pay tax because they were not tax resident here or anywhere else and that is subject to the European Commission's infringement proceedings.  When we made them stateless, and now Apple have confirmed that all those sales are still being recorded in this State, one would imagine that we would be in receipt of a massive windfall of corporation tax from Apple.  That has not happened.  Apple paid &euro;1.5 billion, it tells us, over the last three years in taxation.  Some of this is on the public record and we know that a certain part of the company paid &euro;430 million, but where is the tax from the new company that is no longer stateless that now has sales recorded of &euro;119 billion?  It does not exist because even though the company is no longer stateless, the loophole, a measure the Minister's predecessor introduced, allows it to write off all these capital allowances, the intellectual property that was taken onshore, against all its profits.  Things had come to a point where no one could accept that any company could have no tax residency anywhere in the world so the Government closed that door on Apple but it gave them 13 or 14 months to get its act in order, which it did.  It went to Appleby, got its structure in place, sent the two companies to Jersey, registered one in Ireland, took the intellectual property over and then it used the capital allowances to pay no taxes.  <\/p><p> That the Government did that at that particular time is deeply suspicious.  I want the Minister to put on the record all the engagements which he, his predecessor and their officials had with Apple during that period.  I want him to tell us the lobbying by any individuals regarding the onshoring of intellectual property.  For instance, the head of tax in Allergan, a company based in County Mayo - an individual who has been reported in the context of the Paradise Papers but is not himself involved in the Paradise Papers, he is mentioned in the side reporting of the papers - lobbied the Government and talked about how, with the changes to tax residency, there needed to be certainty as a result of onshoring of intellectual property.  That is the point that I made at the beginning.  There is no way that the Minister or the Department did not know that a change of tax residency rules would result in an onshoring of intellectual property and, as such, I seriously question the Government's motivations, or the motivations of its predecessor, for closing what was a stateless company which was frowned up internationally and then opening a loophole to effectively give the same company an ability to continue not paying tax on sales in excess of &euro;100 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#GGG01300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":630,"content":"<p>We must break for a vote in the D&aacute;il.

Because this measure was passed via a financial resolution on the night of the budget it is in effect from now.  The measure became available and applicable from 11 October 2017.  In relation to the various points Deputy Doherty has put to me, before I refer to them I will make the point that the opportunity that is ahead of this country at the moment is one that other countries are pursuing and are aware of, namely, to be in a position where we have a combination of commercial activity, manufacturing activity, research and development activity and the registration of IP assets, all from the same company located within Ireland.  We have the potential to realise that because of the number of employers we already have located in this country whose companies tend to be associated with and tend to have intellectual property assets that have a high value.  As I look out, with many of the different issues that we have to manage, I see the prospect of us being able to achieve that form of co-location, as something that would be very valuable for Ireland.  In terms of the decisions that I have made in relation to the Finance Bill and this particular amendment, I will outline the reason I have decided to make it applicable from 11 October - it is applicable on a forward-looking basis - the Deputy is correct that it was a policy choice.  The legal framework was there to do it.  My judgment is that at the core of our corporate tax framework is the concept and value of predictability, of being able to explain to people that if they locate jobs and investment in our country that we will tax them in a certain way going forward and that people are clear on that.<\/p><p>My view was that if I introduced a measure like this that was retrospective in the context of assets that had already been moved here, it would deal a massive blow to my ability to be able to argue that our corporate tax code and the policy relating thereto are predictable, clear and certain.  In essence, I would have been claiming that we would now change how we would tax the assets a company had moved in here in the past as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty touched upon this point.  We are talking about the timing of payment of tax; it is deferred tax.  The Deputy stated that this might not apply because we might get an income stream from a company now because of how we tax the intellectual property asset.  The company might not be around in a number of years, however, at which point the reliefs relating to the depreciation of the asset would be gone and we might not be able to claim revenue from that company.  That is not a way in which I can structure tax policy.  I cannot structure tax policy on the basis of my personal view or that of the Government as to whether a company will be around in the future.  If companies are located here, are employing here and have investments located here, we must assume they will be here for a period.  Many of the companies that have been at the heart of the recent debate have had operations located in Ireland for many years.  I will not get into the debate over the tax affairs of a particular company tonight because I must respect its confidentiality as I would for any other taxpayer.<\/p><p> On the timing of this decision and the previous one, I have not had contact with any individual on the matter.  Mr. Seamus Coffey gave me a report.  On the basis of that report, I made a decision, in consultation with my Department and other Departments, on what I believed was the right choice.  I no more went out and sought the opinion of individual companies on this matter than I did with any other measure in this Finance Bill.  I made what I felt was the overall right decision for the country.<\/p><p> Before the change was made, the threshold stood at 80% and then it went to 100%.  At the time it went to 100%, many of the peer countries to which we would have compared ourselves would have treated intellectual property assets in the same way.  It is the right decision to introduce a cap in respect of the depreciation of intellectual property assets and how this is dealt with because of the scale of assets on which we are focusing.  When the decision was made to move it back to 100%, that was the case in other countries to which we would have compared ourselves and countries against which it was important for us to be competitive.<\/p><p> Having said that, I believe this is the right stance for us to take.  It is also apparent to me and to all who debate and discuss these matters that the scale of the assets being moved around is bigger than in the past.  What has had a decisive effect on the attractiveness of Ireland as a place in which such assets could be located is the effect of the OECD work that has happened throughout the world, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months, and that means it is no longer possible to locate these assets in other locations in which they would have been located in the past.  As a result, companies want to find locations for the assets.  It will be of long-term value to Ireland to have the assets located here, taxed in the way I propose and co-located with commercial, manufacturing, and research and development activity.  I am making this decision in the Finance Bill in the context of that view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#KKK00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":634,"content":"<p>The Minister has said the companies at the centre of this have a long-standing relationship with the State.  I accept that the Apple company in Cork that employs more than 4,000 people has been here for a long time.  Hopefully, it will stay for an equally long time.  We are not talking about the company for which the employees work; we are talking about the other companies.  Two of them skedaddled to Jersey.  Apple Sales International is no longer based in Ireland.  Apple Operations International is no longer based in Ireland; it is now based in Jersey.  They left because Ireland decided to end the stateless company status they enjoyed.<\/p> <p>  The other company Apple Operations Europe, AOE, decided to register here for one reason only.  It was because there is no tax implication on the profits attributed to all the sales of products recorded by that company outside America, worth &euro;119 billion, because it is allowed to use its capital allowance against its taxes.  It is able to do that because the Government and the Minister's predecessor allowed that change to happen.<\/p> <p>  Was the Minister, his predecessor or the Department aware that as a result of the change to the residency rules there would be an increase in the onshoring of IP?  Was the Minister lobbied on giving certainty to these companies onshoring IP?  Was that factored into the judgment to change the threshold from 80% to 100%?  The consequence of that was that in the period from 2014 to 2015, the claims for capital allowances went up from &euro;2.8 billion to &euro;28 billion, a massive increase.  However, it does not end there because hundreds of billions worth of IP was taken onshore during that period.  I ask the Minister to answer first those questions on the lobbying of Department of Finance and the Minister over certainty of IP onshoring as a direct result the changes in residency the Government introduced in 2013 and 2014.  I know it happened.  Companies lobbied to have IP onshored.  The Paradise Papers inform us what Apple is doing.  Once all Apple's capital allowances are used up, AOE could move to Jersey or anywhere and then we will never see the taxation on the profits.<\/p> <p>  We need to remember what we are talking about here.  We have discussed a lot of stuff in respect of this Bill over the past two days.  The Minister is deciding to forgo &euro;850 million of tax.  To change that all we have to do is change four numbers in the Finance Bill - just the date of implication.  The Minister wants it only to apply going forward because he wants certainty for Apple that it will not have to pay a penny in tax for the next decade on the &euro;190 billion in transactions it is recording in an Irish company.  That is what the Minister is doing.<\/p> <p>  There are serious questions.  I have serious suspicions that a deal was done.  It may not have been done directly sitting across the table with Apple because people are smarter than this.  However, the Minister knew when the Government closed down the stateless companies that those stateless companies had to do something - either leave here for another jurisdiction, which two of them did, or register here.  Allowing them to take their IP onshore and increasing that to 100% gave them a massive windfall.  It is not just Apple, but Apple is the major beneficiary of it.<\/p><p>The Commission is now looking into its post-2015 structure.  This stinks to high heavens.  As the Minister has said, this is a policy choice.  It has been made by the Minister and not by his officials or legal advisers.  He has decided to let an annual sum of &euro;850 million go amiss.  He has decided to let Apple be able to write off its taxes and to settle for the &euro;150 million that will come in the future.  That is not sensible.  Is the Minister aware of the lobbying that went on regarding the proposal to move intellectual property onshore as a result of the changes in tax residency rules?  Did that factor into the decision made by the Minister at that time?  Will the Minister release all of the documents relating to lobbying directly to the Minister, the Minister of State or any officials within the Department over the period from 2013 to 2015, including any direct or indirect contact with Apple or any of its subsidiaries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#LLL00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Everything about the Apple situation, including the changes made in the budget by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in 2014, stinks to high heaven.  Frankly, it stretches credibility that this happened at a time when new political forces had come into this D&aacute;il.  In 2012 and 2013, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I raised at the then Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform the massive loopholes we could see in the corporate tax regime.  We suggested that the effective rate being paid by big corporations like Apple was a tiny fraction of 12.5%.  The double Irish arrangement was at the centre of that.  There are plenty of other examples of loopholes.  We will talk about some of them in a moment.  When the spotlight began to come on, the reaction of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and Fianna F&aacute;il was to close ranks immediately in order to protect Apple.  In July 2013, when this stuff was starting to be debated, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I proposed that representatives of Apple, Google and Facebook should be brought before the finance committee to face questions about the tax affairs of those companies.  The cameras were literally shut off as a result of a manoeuvre from the Chairman of the committee.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, along with Deputy Donnelly and a couple of others, voted to switch off the cameras while we debated whether Apple and the other companies might be brought in.  Not only did they not want those companies to come in, but they did not even want anyone to know we were discussing whether they should come in.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, the Government closed ranks to protect Apple and ensure it was not questioned about what it was up to.  At this time, international and domestic pressure was building with regard to the double Irish arrangement.  Right up to the last moment, the Government denied that this country was playing any role in that arrangement.  It was finally forced to announce that it would be closed, although it is worth noting that it is still not closed.  It is still operable up to 2020 for companies that have benefited from it.  Apple, and probably others, had to try to find a new way of evading tax.  In January 2014, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple.  I would love to know what happened at that meeting.  I do not know what happened.  The closeness of this Government's relationship with Apple is remarkable.  We know from the Paradise Papers, or, as I like to call them, the parasite papers, that in March 2014, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple began to search for new ways to avoid paying tax.  According to one of the leaks, Baker McKenzie, which was acting on behalf of Apple, contacted Appleby about its various tax haven locations and asked it to \"confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction\".  That is what Apple wanted to do.  It wanted to avoid paying any tax at all and, as we have now discovered, that is what it did.<\/p> <p>  Shortly afterwards, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, decided to change the allowances regime for intangible assets, such as Apple's intellectual property assets from which it derives its profits and around which much of its tax evasion activity centres.  I refer to the manner in which it sells ideas or intellectual property assets from one arm of the company to another, thereby turning profits into costs and consequently writing down its tax liabilities.  Oddly and strangely, we made this change at this time.  It is quite extraordinary.  Frankly, I do not even understand why it should get an 80% allowance, never mind a 100% allowance.  Why should it get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets?  I would like somebody to explain that to me.  When one arm of a company supposedly sells something to another arm of the company, which is a joke in and of itself, the company in question is allowed to claim massive allowances and gain enormous tax benefits that are worth hundreds of millions of euro to the company.  We used to give this company an 80% tax break, but in the year in question, that was increased to 100%.  Why did that happen?  Is it a coincidence that it happened in the same year that Apple had to start thinking about restructuring its tax avoidance strategies?  It moved one of its subsidiaries, which was previously based here, to the Channel Islands.  I presume that company now sells the asset to the Irish-registered company without having to pay any tax on the profit it gets.  It has discovered via Appleby that it pays no tax whatsoever there.  The 100% allowance that the Irish subsidiary gets allows it to write down all of its profits which derive from that intellectual property for the next decade or so.  It is quite extraordinary.  Can the Minister explain how it happened?  Why was that decision made in 2014?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#MMM00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I have already explained to Deputy Doherty that it moved to 100% because it was felt at that time that this would be a way of treating intellectual property that was consistent with how it was being treated elsewhere.

I will consult my departmental officials on the matter to see how contact can be established.  The one principle I want to be absolutely clear on is that Ireland does not set its tax policy on the basis of any particular company, such as the company mentioned by the Deputy or any other company.  We base our corporate tax policy, like all tax policies that are relevant to parts of our economy, on what we think and judge to be the right thing for the economy and for the taxpayer overall.

As soon as there was movement on that particular tax avoidance strategy, lo and behold, we made changes which ensure Apple does not pay a single cent more than it was paying previously.<\/p><p>Not a single cent.  It is perfect restructuring, almost to the euro.  It involves the Channel Islands and the changes in the intangible asset allowance.  It works out so perfectly that companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  Their spin is that they did not pay any less tax.  Brilliant.  They did not, however, pay any more tax; they paid exactly the same amount of tax.  With regard to their tax liability, the net effect of closing down the double Irish is zero as they do not pay any more tax.  This company is nakedly avoiding tax.  Was the Minister aware of this and will he acknowledge that this is what these companies were and are doing?  We might quibble about what the Minister did or did not do, but the reason there had to be movement against the double Irish is because these companies were just nakedly and rampantly seeking to avoid paying tax.  What they are doing is immoral; companies are looking around for tax jurisdictions and loopholes in our tax code so they pay no tax.  We say it is nothing to do with us, it is inconsistencies between tax codes and there is nothing we can do about it.  Yet, Ireland seems to facilitate these companies.  First with the double Irish and when a light is shone on the double Irish we then, coincidentally, facilitate them in a new way.  We may have done it inadvertently.  Is that the explanation?  Inadvertently, the change that was made in 2014 perfectly succeeds in doing exactly what Apple would want to do, given that there was a problem developing with the double Irish tax avoidance strategy.  This is too much of a coincidence.  Does the Minister believe that anybody who looks at this would not say it is too much of a coincidence?  The net result is that these companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax.  How convenient.  Does the Minister not believe that the European Union and Commissioner Vestager have some justification for being suspicious of this and that anybody looking on would say \"Jesus, that stinks\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#MMM00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Looking at the figures, the change that lifted the cap from 80% to 100%, made in the Finance Act 2014 which came into effect in 2015, has had a staggering impact.  Seamus Coffey's online blog makes for very insightful reading.  In 2014, when the 80% cap last applied, &euro;2.6 billion of capital allowances were claimed under that regime.  In 2015, when the cap was increased to 100%, &euro;28.9 billion was claimed for capital allowances under that regime.  This is a more than tenfold increase in the amount of capital allowances claimed in 2015 over 2014.  Presumably, this is directly linked to the change of the cap from 80% to 100%.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show there was a &euro;26 billion increase in intangible asset related gross trading profits in 2015.  There was a dramatic change in the onshoring and the claiming of capital allowances against intangible asset related income.  Does the Minister have data on how much intellectual property, IP, was actually onshored since the change came into effect in the Finance Act 2014?  We need to tease out what is there with regard to stock, IP and related capital allowances since that period of time.  A while ago the Minister said that the corporation tax system should be certain and predictable.  Up to 2014 he had the 80% cap then he removed that and it became 100%.  Now, less than three years later it is going back to 80%, but all the IP, which was onshored in the intervening period, will continue to benefit from the 100% set-off around the limit on income; they can be offset by the capital allowances and the IP.  Will the Minister give the committee the data he has on the IP that was onshored so we can tease out, from a tax point of view, the consequences of treating the capital allowances associated with those?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#NNN00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":641,"content":"<p>With regard to the different points that have been put to me, I reiterate what I said to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We set our tax policy, be it corporation tax or any other policy, on the basis of what we judge to be the right thing for the economy overall and the long-term interests of the Irish taxpayer.  Across the period in which we have made decisions like that, we have seen an increase in corporate tax receipts overall.  This point is missing in the analysis that is being offered here.  In 2014 corporation tax receipts were &euro;4.6 billion.  They grew to &euro;6.9 billion.  For this year we are currently expecting corporation tax receipts of &euro;8.3 billion.  We are collecting more corporation tax at the moment.  One of the factors in this is changes that have been made over the last number of years in how we structure our corporate tax policy.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked how we can handle IP that moved here in the past.  Again, I will emphasise two points.  We are talking about the timing in which depreciation reliefs are run down.  Overall this makes a big difference to the timing in which tax is collected.  It is a timing issue around when we actually collect tax from companies.  Alongside that, while much of the debate here is focused on a particular company, I have to consider that this is a tax policy I would have to set for every company located in Ireland.  I would have to say to every company that has an intellectual property asset, regardless of its form, that Ireland would change how it taxed the assets the company had moved here in the past.  It was my judgment, and my decision, that a policy such as that would undermine the predictability at the heart of our corporate tax offering, and which is essential to its competitiveness with all the change that is under way now.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McGrath asked about figures and I have some of them.  I have the figures relating to the corporate tax reliefs that have been claimed but I believe the Deputy already has those.  The other figures that I have available to me from our national accounts relate to the purchase of patents, which is part of the movement of intellectual property assets.  Those figures are as follows: in 2014 it was &euro;1.9 billion; in 2015 it was &euro;8.3 billion; in 2016 it was &euro;35 billion; and in the first half of 2017 it was &euro;11 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#NNN00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":642,"content":"<p>When the Minister says that Ireland's corporate tax revenue has increased he forgets to mention the extraordinary rise in profits during that period.  The percentage increase in profits far outstrips any proportionate increase in tax revenue.  For example, 2012 pre-tax trading profits were &euro;76 billion.  By 2015 these had gone up to &euro;149 billion.  As we know, and we can surmise, a vast amount of that is attributable to these companies' enormous and spectacular increase in profits that are beyond belief.  A doubling of aggregate corporate tax profits is overwhelmingly attributable to a small number of companies.<\/p><p>Just as those profits go through the roof we give them extra tax allowances to ensure that there is not a commensurate increase in the proportion of tax that we will get from it.  I accept that there is some increase - how could there not be - when profits increase to that extent.  Proportionately, however, the effective rate is going down not up.  It is actually going down and it is already pitifully low.<\/p><p> In addition, the effective rate as against the total profits is actually falling for these companies because of measures that we are taking or our failures to close down these loopholes.  In doing that they are robbing this country of tax revenues that we should be getting.  They are also robbing people all around the world.  All of the tax and global justice groups say this kind of behaviour that Apple, Facebook and Google are engaging in is the major contributory factor to growing global inequality, poverty and deprivation.  These people are robbing us blind in a deliberate, naked and explicit drive to ensure that they pay no taxes whatsoever.  <\/p><p> The Minister has not really answered the question as to whether he finds that morally repugnant.  Is the Government bothered by that?  The signs are, given the behaviour of the Government, that it does not find it repugnant but in fact at best turns a blind eye to it and at worst is actively colluding with it.  Deputy Doherty and I have both set out the chain of events where very serious questions are now also being asked by the European Union about what happened and why it happened.  We also need to know about the lobbying and the interactions that this Government had with Apple and with any of these other companies.<\/p><p> The one aspect on which I will agree with the Minister is that this is not about one company, although there is definitely one favoured company that is leading the charge.  It concerns a few companies, a very small number.  It is maybe five to ten companies who accrue these massive tax benefits because of the regime that we have and the changes that we made in terms of window we created for them between 2014 and now.  The move to reintroduce the 80% rate is closing the door after the horse has bolted and followed the massive onshoring of these assets.  That allows those companies to pay no tax for a decade ahead against these enormous profits.  It looks like collusion.  Their behaviour is certainly immoral.  Does the Minister agree that it is immoral?  <\/p><p> If the Minister does agree that it is immoral, why do we not capture the additional tax benefit that these companies have accrued as a result of the change from the 100% to the 80% going back to when that change was made?  Why do we not do that if we think it is wrong?  I do not see how anybody could say what they are doing is not wrong.  Why do we not do it?  Is it because we made an agreement with them?  Is it that we gave assurances to Apple and a few others at the time that we are going to allow them to do that?  Otherwise, I do not see why we would not do it.  Many people, and not just the left and Sinn F&eacute;in, are saying that the window they were given should be closed and we should recover that 20% difference which resulted from the changes in 2014 and, in the process, get the &euro;800 million or so that would accrue if we did that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#NNN00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Doherty before the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#OOO00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Section  21(1)(a) clarifies the issue of a traded company and what would be treated as a relevant trade.

We will have differing views regarding what that level of tax could be because of potentially differing views regarding those companies and the role they play.  However, I strongly believe that they should pay their fair share of tax.  That is the reason why I am committed to putting in place the different measures that form part of the OECD work that is underway and having them enacted in the Irish tax code.  It is important that we all move in a co-ordinated way across the world to make sure that opportunities do not exist for companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  I strongly believe that to be the case and that is one of the reasons why I am committed to the OECD process and one of the reasons why in the Finance Bill I am seeking to make progress in that area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point concerning an allegation of collusion, I want to state again very clearly that we do not make tax policy on the basis of the needs of any company.  We do it on the basis of what we judge and believe to be the right thing for the economy overall or for a sector within the economy.  That has been my guiding principle in making this decision to go back to 80% because I believe that it is the right thing for our economy.  I also believe it is the right thing in the context of the scale of these assets and their movement across the world that we have this form of taxing them.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to why I will not go back, in terms of the point the Deputy raises, it goes back to the earlier point I made here that I do not do tax policy on the basis of individual companies.  If I was to make a decision like this it would apply to all companies and all intellectual property assets.  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is my view that if I was to make a change like that if would affect the view that people have regarding what Ireland is offering now and in the future, including many companies that have not been mentioned here that have investments in the country.

We are only just starting to see the tip of the iceberg that is the Paradise Papers and I have no doubt but that we will see more of a spotlight being shone on tax structures.<\/p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of lobbying.  Are the Minister and his officials aware of the lobbying that took place when the Government changed the threshold from 80% to 100% in 2014?  Will the Minister inform the committee of this?  Will he give a commitment, if he does not have the information to hand, to inform us of all of the individuals, groups and representative bodies who lobbied the Department, the Minister and the Ministers of State on this issue, either directly or indirectly?  We already know, for example, that during this very period the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland was lobbying the Department for the threshold to be increased.  I do not know if Apple is a member of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland but I am sure that it has the interests of Apple and companies like it at heart.  That chamber lobbied as part of its pre-budget submission in 2015 for the threshold to be increased.  What is interesting is that it only asked for it to go up to 90%, whereas the Government went the whole hog of raising it to 100%.  We also know that the Department was lobbied on the onshoring of intellectual property as a result of the change to the tax residency rules.  We know that the Minister himself was lobbied by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland with regard to tax changes.  I would like him to inform the committee now if any of this concerned the threshold and the date from which it would apply.  Was there any discussion of that when he had a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland?  Will he also put on the record if he or his officials have had any other meetings with representative groups with regard to any aspect of this issue?  Did the Department notify, engage with or seek the opinion of any of these companies?  I do not mean directly with the companies themselves, of course, as we know how these things work and it is usually through legal representatives.  Did the Department seek advice from bodies outside of the Department with regard to the application of this section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#QQQ00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Doherty's direct question, this matter did not come up at my meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland and I certainly did not seek the chamber's view on it.

We have made the point.  To paraphrase the Minister, he said the Government does not gear its tax policy around any particular company.  That is probably true because I think it was more around a group of companies.  The Minister did refer to sectors of industry.  I think it was a group of companies who benefitted from this.  We are all familiar with names such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and a few others.  I believe that whether it was through direct lobbying or just the servile attitude that successive Governments, not just that of which Deputy Donohoe is a part, but previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, have shown towards those companies to the effect that they just want to do anything they can to please them and that means tailoring the tax code to suit their purposes.<\/p><p>We have had the discussion so there is no point in labouring it.  We clearly disagree on this issue.  However, I take issue with the argument the Minister made about what would happen were we to go back and close the window that was opened for them in 2014, which the Minister is only closing now after all the intangible assets have been onshored and where they will derive the tax benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years.<\/p><p>I do take issue with the argument the Minister makes that, were we to go back and close the window that was opened for these companies in 2014, and which he is only closing now after all these intangible assets have already been onshored, and where they will derive the enormous benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years, many other people might be affected where there might be a legitimate basis for their expectation to benefit from that change.<\/p><p> I do not know how the Minister does not draw a distinction between a company that might actually purchase an intellectual property asset, where it is a genuine cost on the company, and a company that is clearly doing this as an accountancy exercise, where it is not a cost on the company because it is buying the asset from itself and has set up a network of companies purely for the purposes of minimising its tax liability and benefitting from these kinds of allowances.  I just do not see how the Minister does not draw the distinction and why the tax code cannot so do.  Of course, if there are legitimate costs for a business, it is reasonable that it should get an allowance on those costs against its trading profits to reduce its tax liability.  However, this is a case of Apple, Google or Facebook moving around assets between its own subsidiaries in order to manipulate the tax code and reduce its tax liability.  Everyone knows that, the Minister know it, and we have known it since long before 2014 and the onshoring of these assets.  All of the tax avoidance that has been engaged in by these companies all centred around similar types of manoeuvres around intellectual property and payments of one subsidiary to another, whether from stateless subsidiaries that were incorporated here but not tax-liable here or subsidiaries that are no longer stateless but are located in Jersey, where they do not have to pay tax anyway, so it is the same difference.  It is the same type of tax avoidance strategy and it is one company doing it.  Therefore, I do not see how they can in any sense be deemed legitimate costs.  It is just a way for such companies to reduce their tax liabilities on their absolutely staggering profits, and they are literally writing their own tax bills.  They are deciding how much tax they will pay, not the Government, the tax code or the nominal tax rate.  None of that actually determines how much tax they pay; they decide how much tax they pay through a manipulative accountancy exercise.  I do not see how the Minister deems that to be legitimate and, as I said, why he cannot draw a distinction between companies that clearly are engaged in tax avoidance and companies that might actually have a legitimate claim on an allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#TTT00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":686,"content":"<p>For the purpose of being clear about how this issue is dealt with, I must inform the Deputy that there are a number of ways in which section 291A is structured to try to make sure it is not used for tax avoidance purposes.  I will list the key ones, given the claims the Deputy has just made.  Relief is only available where a company is carrying out a bona fide trading activity in respect of the management, development or exploiting of intangible assets.  Relief is not available in respect of any expenditure incurred as part of a tax avoidance scheme.  Under the scheme, allowances can only be offset against income of development trade in which the intangible assets are used, not against any other profits.  An arm's-length rule applies, ensuring that the correct amount of income expenditure is attributed to the relevant trade and to prevent excessive relief being claimed.  Finally, provision is made for Revenue to engage an expert to assist in the determination of arm's-length values where necessary, and the Revenue Commissioners keep these measures under review all the time to make sure they are operated as intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UUU00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>That is not very credible because the parent company is deciding how much one subsidiary will charge the other for the use of the intellectual property.

That is what these companies are doing, and we all know it, so it is a tax avoidance strategy.  As the Minister said, our tax code - I cannot remember the exact section - actually refers to not allowing, or prohibiting, things that are very obviously tax avoidance tactics.

It is worth saying the same groups we have just talked about are the major beneficiaries of this: the Apples, Googles and Facebooks and probably the pharmaceutical companies and so on.  A relatively small number of companies benefit from this vast array of allowances, deductions and reliefs.  What we seek in moving this amendment is a really detailed look at these, with a view to trying to close down all these loopholes that are being exploited to reduce the effective rate being paid by a small number of corporations.  I think the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country do pay in or around the 12.5% because they cannot for the most part utilise many of these reliefs.  It is the big players, the favoured, pampered few of these extraordinarily profitable corporations, that are the big beneficiaries and have the accountants, the consultants and the lawyers and so on to maximise the benefit they derive from all these reliefs.  The scale of the tax benefits they derive is quite extraordinary.  We have talked about the intangible assets.  Another one I came across looking at Revenue's list of these reliefs and allowances is the one entitled intra-group transactions.  I would not mind hearing a little more about this one, which was a relief that cost the Exchequer &euro;2.9 billion in 2015 and &euro;9 billion in 2016.  Again, it is one of these reliefs where we see a staggering increase over one year.<\/p><p>If the officials want the document to which I have referred it is the second page of a Revenue document titled Cost of Tax Allowances, Credits, Exemptions and Reliefs<b>.<\/b>It details the various reliefs.  Losses, including capital allowances brought forward from earlier years, were mentioned earlier, and account for &euro;2.7 billion; group relief costs &euro;254 million; research and development tax credit, &euro;700 million; and capital allowances totalling &euro;6 billion.  The total of these, when we add them all up and set them against profits, is extraordinary.  Mr. Seamus Coffey remarks on this in what is a very good paper.  As I have said before, I do not agree with his ultimate conclusions, as I do not think they are radical enough.  However, he comments on the enormous increase in these deductions and allowances.  He writes that they have increased from &euro;18.9 billion in 2003 to &euro;97 billion in 2015.  Those are all tax loopholes that a small number of corporations benefit from.  I repeat, the increase is from &euro;18.9 billion to &euro;97 billion, an extraordinary jump by any standards.<br\/><br\/>If the small and medium enterprises are for the most part actually paying the 12.5% rate, this explains how a small number of corporations benefitting from these reliefs have actual effective tax rates of 1%, 2%, or in some cases less than 1%.  At the same time, their total aggregate profits, as I mentioned earlier, have gone from &euro;76 billion in 2012 to &euro;149 billion, more than doubling.  There is no doubt that this doubling of profits is attributable to the same small group of companies.  Yet the tax that we get from it does not double.  If gross trading profits double over that period, then one would think our tax revenue would double.  Yet that is not the case.  The increase is from about &euro;4 billion to about &euro;6 billion.  That is a 50% increase in corporate tax revenue, roughly speaking, but there has been more than a 100% increase in profits in that period.  How does one explain that?  It is explained by the fact that we have had this dramatic increase in allowances, reliefs and deductions.  <br\/><br\/>Do the members not think we should do something about that, and move towards some sort of minimum effective rate so that these players would be forced to pay a fair contribution in tax, rather than doing what we are doing at the moment?  If I give the best interpretation of what the Government is doing, it is chasing them around, trying to catch up with them as their lawyers and accountants engineer ever more imaginative and innovative ways to get around and exploit the tax code, to open up loopholes and so on.  That is the most benign explanation of what is happening.<br\/><br\/>However, I believe it is worse than that.  I think there is collusion.  Even if I am wrong, surely the way to deal with it, to stop this behaviour, to stop this exploitation of loopholes and to make these people pay a fair proportion of their enormous profits in tax, is to introduce some sort of minimum effective rate.  I would go further.  I would do that and raise the nominal rate.  I know that would be unthinkable for the Minister but could we not at least introduce a minimum effective rate, so that they actually pay the 12.5%?  <br\/><br\/>These companies would still be making staggering levels of profit.  I do not believe they would leave the country if we did that, because even if they actually pay the 12.5% they would still be paying significantly less here than they are in most jurisdictions in Europe, at least in western Europe, which is where they want to be.  I am sure they want to be in English-speaking western Europe, so our real competition for a lot of this investment is probably only Britain and Scotland.<br\/><br\/>Would that not be a fair and reasonable thing to do?  Would it not be fair and reasonable, as this amendment suggests, to at least look at all of these allowances and deductions, examine how they are being exploited by these corporations, and look at ways of trying to increase the tax take from them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#UUU00900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty, amendment No. 46 is yours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#VVV00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  My amendment is different, but it captures some of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  It focuses specifically on the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit.  I believe there is a value to the R&amp;D tax credit.  I am not arguing for it to be abolished but I am concerned about the way it is set.  I am concerned about the fact that it is out of control and that the cost of this tax credit is increasing dramatically.  We need to do something about it.  It needs to be reformed.  We see that the cost of the tax credit in 2010 was &euro;224 million, yet five years later it went up to &euro;708 million.  That is a huge increase in a tax credit.<\/p> <p>  We also see that the number of companies availing of the tax credit has actually decreased, particularly in the 2013-15 period, when the tax credit increased by &euro;300 million.  We know from the data provided by the Revenue and from the independent analysis that ten companies are currently claiming two thirds of the credit.  Some &euro;460 million of it is going to ten companies.  We also know that &euro;283 million of it is dead weight, that is, research and development worth &euro;283 million would have been carried out anyway.  In any type of tax credit there will be a portion of dead weight but 40% is on the high end.  <\/p> <p>  I know the Government is not there to please me but I do not think it is a good practice to release a lot of these reports on budget day.  A case in point was the help-to-buy report.  I do not think there was anything in that report that could have affected the market, and it could have been released a week before.  This review of the tax credits is another example because there is so much information surrounding it.  It is good that there is so much information in the budget documents but when reports like that are published online on that day they sometimes do not get the attention they deserve.  The evaluation was not a full evaluation or a cost-benefit analysis, and that is something that should be done on the R&amp;D tax credit.  It did recognise that the relief is reasonably successful but it notes that this must be immediately qualified by referring to the notable dead weight associated with this unrestricted fiscal incentive and it goes on to refer to the 40% dead weight. <\/p> <p>  One of the key things that jumped out at me is that when this report was done, the cost of the tax credit for 2015 was not known.  At the end of the conclusions it suggests, as another approach, lowering the tax reduction to firms that need a break.  The report notes that the value of outstanding credits in 2014 was &euro;592 million and given the size of this future liability to the Exchequer, it recommends considering how to prevent it from increasing even further in the future.  The authors go on to suggest a number of ways in which that can be done.  In 2014, the figure was &euro;553 million, yet within a year it jumped to &euro;708 million.  God knows where it was in 2016, and indeed 2017, but on this basis we could be looking at a billion-euro tax credit very soon.  The problem here is that two thirds of it is going to the top ten companies, so it does not reach small and medium enterprises.  Indeed, the report refers to the fact that younger companies are not benefitting from this and it refers to a wait-and-see approach.  That is not good for younger companies.<\/p> <p>  We have a scheme that is not working and is costing a lot of money.  The number of companies that it are availing of it shrinking, yet the cost of it is increasing and there is significant dead weight.<\/p><p>While 40% of dead weight might be acceptable in a lower-cost scheme, when the dead weight is at over &euro;250 million, we have to ask about the structure of the tax credit.  My amendment therefore calls for a report within six months setting out the specific actions to be taken to reform the research and development tax credit, reduce the cost of the credit, stop abuses relating to inflated claims and make the credit more appropriate for SMEs.  I refer to abuses because there appears to be a mismatch in the CSO data and the data provided by companies.  That could be the result of an inflation of research and development for the purposes of gaining the tax credit.  That is something that would need to be teased out.  I am not asking the Minister to amend this now as I do not really know how to do that.  There is a report already which has provided a number of suggestions.  We need to signal the fact that there will be changes to the research and development tax credit, in relation to which the Minister needs to carry out a proper and full cost-benefit analysis as suggested.  It is time to look at implementing some of the recommendations suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#VVV00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I did not speak to the second part of my amendment and I want to say one brief word to put it all together before the Minister comes back in.  This is specifically on the research and development tax credit.  I am asking the Minister to consider whether the amount of money which has been given in a tax allowance for research and development to a very small number of corporations, as has already said, would be better spent on public universities.  The debate is often framed as follows.  If one is against research and development credits, one is claimed to be against innovation and research and development.  I am very much in favour of research and development but there is an opportunity cost in giving the funding to private companies through tax expenditures because that money is not going to public universities. There would be a lot more benefit and advantage for the domestic economy if that happened.  I refer to the real Irish economy as against the economy that exists around a tiny number of multinational corporations which could be gone at any point and who get far more from us than we get from them.  We should look at which approach would provide a greater benefit to the Irish economy and society as a whole.

This will only take one moment to do.  First, I have been asked by the Revenue Commissioner to clarify a comment made during the earlier discussion on REITs.  REITs do not get a tax deduction for local property tax.  REITs pay a dividend out of the profits available for distribution and the shareholders are taxed on the amount received.  I think there was an exchange earlier that may not have given that point the certainty it needed.  On another matter relating to section 8 of the Bill, my officials have advised me that a technical amendment may be required to make the section work as intended.  I am signalling that I may need to bring such an amendment forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  On the amendments proposed by Deputies Doherty and Boyd Barrett, I note that the Irish corporation tax regime contains a small number of specifically-targeted tax reliefs the focus of which is on the creation of additional employment, as is consistent with current Government policy on innovation, with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  In contrast, our approach to this tax is clear.  We have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.  The amendments relate to a number of different areas which I will address individually.<\/p> <p>  Under existing loss-relief provisions in the Taxes Act, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for off-set against trading income of the same trade in a future accounting period.  Losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade are a normal fact of business life.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code as it is in all other OECD countries.  The carrying forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The central purpose of the knowledge development box, or KDB, is to encourage companies to carry out their substantive activities in Ireland.  The KDB is based on the modified nexus approach which was designed by the OECD as part of the BEPS project and is not designed by tax planners seeking to design complex tax avoidance structures.  By adhering to the rules, the KDB is a positive measure for Ireland which is focused on incentivising substantive research and development and encouraging companies to bring in real operations and high quality jobs that have a positive impact on the Irish economy.  The research and development tax credit is also a very important feature of the Irish corporate tax structure.  The central purpose of the tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high value-added research and development activity in Ireland thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  Reflecting these considerations, the Government's innovation 2020 strategy aims to achieve the EU 2020 target of increasing overall, i.e. public and private, research and development expenditure in Ireland to 2.5% of GNP by 2020.<\/p> <p>  A review of the research and development credit was carried out by my Department ahead of budget 2017.  It concluded that the credit was responsible for 60% of the research and development being conducted in our country.  This is considered to be a reasonable level of additionality.  The bang-for-buck ratio is estimated to be 2.4.  That means for every &euro;1 in foregone tax revenue, &euro;2.40 in additional research and development is being conducted.  This is also considered a reasonable result.  Overall, the paper's findings suggest that the rationale for the research and development tax credit is not in question.  Firms have clearly responded to it by increasing their research and development.  My officials and I are conscious of the need to evaluate the research and development tax credit regularly, but it is important to recognise that while this is a significant credit, it is one of the few tax credits in our corporate tax code compared to other jurisdictions.  However, I am mindful of the need to monitor the cost of this tax credit and will continue to do so in line with the Department's tax expenditure guidelines.<\/p> <p>  In line with the established practice of carrying out periodic reviews of key areas of tax policy, a review of Ireland's corporate tax code has recently been undertaken.  The review made 18 substantial recommendations which we are now working to implement.  Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the review sets out a road map for the State to create certainty on the implementation of the recommended measures.  These include the launch of a consultation process which is now under way.  Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.<\/p> <p>  One of the points raised during the contributions of the Deputies related to the discrepancy between the Revenue Commissioner and CSO figures.  According to the CSO, total business expenditure and research and development, which is referred to as \"BERD\", was provisionally estimated at &euro;2.1 billion in 2014, of which &euro;200 million related to capital expenditure.  Initial Revenue tax returns indicated a 2014 figure of &euro;4.6 billion, with no capital expenditure subtotal given.<\/p><p>In 2014, at that point a broad definition of Research and Development was still in operation in the Revenue guidelines.  The Revenue Commissioners has now confirmed that the initial figures, including carry forward tax credits resulted in a double counting of the eligible expenditure.  Further data provided by Revenue, removing the influence of the carry forward credits indicate there is not a substantial difference between the Revenue's estimates for gross expenditure linked the Research and Development tax credit and the CSO's BERD.  In regard to the cost and why it keeps increasing, the costs of the scheme have continued to rise and the most up-to-date figure is &euro;708 million with 1,535 claims.  It has risen from &euro;282 million in 2012.  However, between 2012 and 2015, the base year threshold of the research and development tax credit was phased out and ultimately removed.  This entailed that all relevant expenditure could qualify for the tax credit, where previously qualified expenditure for research and development was only that in excess of the expenditure incurred in 2003.  In other words there was a change in the base year which in turn had effect in the cost which increased the following years.  <\/p><p> I am aware that this is one of the few credits we have in our corporate tax code and that is in contrast to other countries with whom we compete.  I am also aware of the fact that this is tax expenditure that is increasing and has increased significantly.  While I can point to plausible reasons as to why this has happened, it is reaching a very large and even larger figure and I will monitor further growth in that figure carefully across next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#WWW00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Are the amendments being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is a disappointing response.  I think the Minister is ignoring some of the points made in the report.  The report states that it is pertinent  to ensure that this does not increase.  After the publication of the report we find out that it has already increased by another  &euro;150 million.  The Minister is also ignoring the recommendations in the report about multiple claims and the fact that it does not affect younger firms.<\/p> <p>  My amendment is very simple.  By the time we return next year to consider the finance Bill the research and development tax credit could be worth &euro;1,000 million.  In my amendment I  request the Minister to report on action to be taken to reform the tax credit.  It needs to be reformed as fewer companies  are availing of it and younger companies are not availing of it.  It completely out of control.  The rate of increase is &euro;150 million a year.  We argued the toss of &euro;10 million here and &euro;10 million there, but this is similar to the Minister spending this amount of money.<\/p> <p>  It is disappointing that the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I see the value in research and development tax credits.  It is important for companies to have that tax credit.  It is also important for the certainty of research and development but we have to do something about it.  The Minister has given no commitment to a review of the tax credit.  The report that he published on budget day last year called for further analysis on it.  There was no cross-benefit analysis and it referred to simpler ways for analysing it.  I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage but I encourage the Minister to look again at that report and come back with a substantial amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":703,"content":"<p>The Minister did not  revert to the issue of research in universities and the bang for the buck that we derive from encouraging research and development through these allowances for private companies and, as has been said, the small number of big corporations that benefit from it.  It seems to amount to the privatisation of research and development.  The funding of our universities was hammered during the period of austerity.  They lost approximately 30% of their funding.  Would it not be better, rather than have this huge tax expenditure on research and development tax credits, to put more money back into our universities?  Should we not at least examine which would be more beneficial to our economy and our society and examine whether this is a good tax expenditure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I already have plans to increase the level of expenditure in third and fourth level institutions.  As Deputies know, I made an announcement that I am planning to increase the training levy by 0.1% per year for the next three years.  For next year alone that will bring in an additional &euro;36 million to &euro;37 million that would be available for higher and further education in our country.  I plan to increase that by two further moves afterwards.  I have also made a very significant increase in funding that is available to the Department of Education and Skills.  Granted, much of that funding is going into challenges that the Department must meet in primary and secondary education.  That is the reason I have decided to increase the training levy in employers' PRSI, to create a funding stream that will go directly to third, fourth level education.  I decided on a levy rather than a tax because if I introduced a tax I would not have the ability to divert it to that sector.<\/p> <p>  I largely agree with the Deputies on the value of research and development in our universities.  To end on a final point of agreement, the research and development that takes place under this tax credit clearly has to have a commercial value to the company, otherwise it would not be happening.  We link it into particular criteria.  One of the reasons that I want to increase funding to universities is that there is a great value and benefit in research and development that does not have a commercial value.  Our universities are the place where that should happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":705,"content":"<p>Are the amendments being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I understand that if I press the amendment and not call for a vote, I can re-enter the amendment on Report Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510135200,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>We will move on to amendment No. 46.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX00900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":709,"content":"<p>We must deal with amendment No. 43 before that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110800002#XXX01000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>As it is now 10 p.m. we will adjourn as agreed earlier.
