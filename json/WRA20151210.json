The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) are key delivery programmes under the Social Housing Strategy.   <\/p>  <p>  In the case of RAS, the Scheme was established with the dual purpose of eliminating long-term dependence on the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rent supplementation scheme and enhancing the capacity of local authorities to respond to long-term housing need. Under the Scheme, value for money can be viewed in a number of ways and can reflect both direct and indirect financial costs and benefits. The cost of the Scheme is determined by the on-going cost of meeting contractual commitments with property owners. Local authorities, in negotiating contracts with property owners, seek to maximise a discount on market rent. The funding to support the cost of RAS is made available through the redirection of resources from the Department of Social Protection. Monies are provided on an Exchequer neutral basis to meet the cost of persons transferring from rent supplement to RAS. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), units provided in long-term leased arrangements are subject to formal, professional valuation procedures to agree rents payable, and for the most part require Departmental approval. In respect of proposals examined by the Department, an average discount of 20% below market rent is being achieved. In addition, regular rent reviews are specified in each agreement. <\/p>  <p>The Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP) scheme, which is currently being rolled out on a pilot basis, has been designed with the intention of providing efficiencies to both tenants and landlords, and value for money for the Exchequer. As well as removing a barrier to employment, by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, the HAP scheme improves regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and it provides certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord. In order to test HAP processes and provide efficiencies, Limerick City and County Council are currently providing a transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities on an interim basis. This shared service structure   ensures greater consistency of processes, and resource efficiencies, by managing all HAP tenants and landlords through   one Financial Management System.     The operation of the pilot has facilitated a better understanding of the business and operational requirements, including identifying areas where efficiencies can be gained. <\/p>  <p>While my Department keeps its housing delivery mechanisms under regular review, I am satisfied that the RAS, SHCEP and HAP schemes represent good value for money for the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[44054\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will introduce sectorial targets to reduce carbon emissions, given the discussions in Paris in France discussions and the need for this State to meet its international obligations.","asker":"1102","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015, expected to be enacted very shortly. The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015.  In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectorial mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.   <\/p>  <p>Development of the National Mitigation Plan is being   guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition, as set out in the National Policy Position based on:<\/p>  <p>  - an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and<\/p>  <p>- in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.   <\/p>  <p>The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this vision by 2050. In that context, the National Mitigation Plan now being developed will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.   <\/p>  <p>I have no plans at this time to introduce sectorial targets. As noted above, the National Policy Position sets out the ambition level for the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors in aggregate rather than as individual sectorial objectives. This is to ensure that it can be achieved at minimum cost. The proposed iterative process to pursue and achieve this aggregate ambition level will allow Departments and Government collectively to establish the most cost-efficient options at a point in time. Inevitably, the cost of some technologies will reduce over time and the least-cost transition advice and trajectory will evolve accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[44436\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will make a decision on an application by persons (details supplied) in Dublin 5 under the carer's allowance scheme.","asker":"1021","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on the 10 November 2015.

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  <\/p><p>A breakdown of rent supplement recipients in Louth and Meath is provided in the attached tabular statements. Rent supplement expenditure from 2011 to 2015 is also provided. A breakdown of expenditure by county is not available.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic direction is to transfer responsibility of persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under HAP.  There are currently over 1,500 recipients of rent supplement in Louth of which 1,240 are in receipt of the scheme for periods over 18 months. To date, approximately 240 long term rent supplement recipients in Louth have transferred to HAP. The complete transfer of all long term recipients to HAP will take place over a period of time. <\/p><p>In local authority areas where HAP is in place, including Louth and Meath, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement. Rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require a short term income support to pay their rent. HAP recipients whose landlords refuse to renew their tenancy should engage with their local authority. Policy responsibility and reporting on HAP is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p><p>In view of the current difficulties in the private rented market, rent supplement policy continues to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the scheme. Under this approach each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. Community Welfare Service staff have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  In addition the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where the supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this protocol to Galway City. I am keeping this matter under review including any further extension of the Protocol in place with Threshold.<\/p><p>Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate. This flexible approach has supported over 5,400 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which 71 cases refer to householders in Louth. A county breakdown of this information is provided in the attached tabular statement.  <\/p><p>The Department has undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures and the Tenancy Protection Service (if in Dublin or Cork city) including the issue of text messages to circa 50,000 rent supplement recipients; updating messages on the Department&rsquo;s website and monthly tweeting of information; updating the Citizens Information homepage and their micro site &ldquo;keepingyourhome.ie&rdquo;. A national poster campaign was also launched with posters distributed locally to Department offices, Post Offices, libraries, credit unions, etc.  <\/p><p>I believe that these measures - and the reforms to the private rental sector announced last month - will continue to provide adequate support to rent supplement customers and will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market. <\/p><p>Table 1:Number of Rent Supplement Recipients by County, 2011 to date<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<br \/><br \/>End Nov<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>2,734<\/td><td>2,549<\/td><td>2,422<\/td><td>2,211<\/td><td>1,508<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>2,723<\/td><td>2,143<\/td><td>1,941<\/td><td>1,726<\/td><td>1,538<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Table 2: Rent Supplement Expenditure: 2011 to date<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>502,747<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>422,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>338,347<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>298,415 1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>1Revised 2015 Expenditure<\/p><p>Table 2: Total Increased Rental Payments by County under Rent Supplement at 07\/12\/\/2015<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework<\/th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold<\/th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>21<\/td><td><\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>13<\/td><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>60<\/td><td><\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>204<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>272<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>-<\/td><td><\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>2,058<\/td><td>1,588<\/td><td>3,646<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>101<\/td><td><\/td><td>101<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>18<\/td><td><\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>189<\/td><td><\/td><td>189<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>110<\/td><td><\/td><td>110<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>97<\/td><td><\/td><td>97<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>44<\/td><td><\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>90<\/td><td><\/td><td>90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>71<\/td><td><\/td><td>71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>3<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>235<\/td><td><\/td><td>235<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>49<\/td><td><\/td><td>49<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>12<\/td><td><\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>-<\/td><td><\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>165<\/td><td><\/td><td>165<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>26<\/td><td><\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>89<\/td><td><\/td><td>89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>82<\/td><td><\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>3,752<\/td><td>1,656<\/td><td>5,408<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Payments","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[44457\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000058#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if community welfare offices in County Louth have the capacity to assist persons with meeting the cost of deposits for accommodation within the remit of the exceptional needs payment scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

In cases where residential development is commercially viable, NAMA funds such development in order that its debtors and receivers can maximise their repayment of debt and deliver a surplus to taxpayers. I am advised that, as part of any NAMA-funded residential development, NAMA debtors and receivers will abide by their Part V obligation to deliver 10% of the stock as social housing.<\/p>  <p>  It is neither equitable nor feasible to impose different social housing obligations on developers, based purely on their sources of development finance. To impose on a NAMA debtor a higher obligation to deliver social housing than is imposed, for instance, on a developer who is funded by a bank or who has access to other sources of finance, would be arbitrary and discriminatory.  From the perspective of a NAMA debtor, their capacity to redeem their debt is a primary consideration and imposing additional obligations over and above the obligations that are imposed on a debtor outside NAMA would reduce their capacity to repay their debt.<\/p>  <p>  As I recently pointed out in Parliamentary Question 171 of 8 December 2015, NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding will only be made available if it is expected to increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded. NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, NAMA has already played a very important role in facilitating, on a commercial basis, the supply of houses and apartments for social housing from within its existing portfolio. By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers.  This equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V (Social Housing) legislation in the years between 2002 and 2011.  It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.<\/p>  <p>  The core housing issue we face is that of insufficient supply of housing generally, which impacts the supply of social housing, starter homes and all other categories of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  Any contribution to the overall supply of housing will therefore have a positive impact for housing across all categories.  Therefore, NAMA's contribution to the housing market and by association social housing is timely and welcome.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's commercial funding programme, being an independent and commercial initiative, does not contradict or lessen the Government's commitment to deliver on our Social Housing 2020 strategy.  We are also combining these long term measures with interim solutions to deal with the immediate issues that families currently face.  This is why Budget 2016 increased the current allocation for social housing by &euro;69 million to &euro;414 million. This will enable local authorities to secure accommodation for an additional 14,000 households. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Government's 6 year capital investment framework, \"Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021\", which was recently announced by Minister Howlin, the current allocation for emergency accommodation for the homeless, has been increased by &euro;17 million. This increase will bring Exchequer support to &euro;70 million, which amounts to a 56% increase since last year. This injection of funding will help the homeless transition to long term sustainable housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also recently agreed on a package of measures designed to give certainty to tenants in relation to their rent, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity to both tenants and landlords as regards their rights and obligations. The primary measure in this package is the amendment of the Residential Tenancies Act so that rent reviews for all tenancies will take place every 24 months, rather than every 12 months as currently is the case. This will provide tenants with a longer period of predictable rent. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, addressing the issues facing the housing market generally, social housing, and homelessness, particularly among families, are clearly key priorities for this Government and I can assure the Deputy that NAMA's residential funding programme are complementary to, rather than in lieu of, the Government's commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD01250"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[44462\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of extending the existing PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650 to all individuals who currently pay income tax as a self-employed persons.","asker":"1204","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question refers to the payment of tax as a self-employed person, it is assumed that the Deputy is interested in the additional cost of increasing the Earned Income Credit (EIC) introduced in Budget 2016, from the &euro;550 to &euro;1,650, the level of the existing PAYE tax credit.

As a claim for the HRI credit can only be made in the year after works have been paid for, there was no cost to the Exchequer in 2014 (works paid for in the period from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 were deemed to have been paid for in 2014). <\/p><p><b>Additional Income Tax Reliefs<\/b><\/p><p>Other property based reliefs include interest relief on loans to acquire a principal private residence (PPR) (terminated for any new cases after 31 December 2012 interest relief for PPRs purchased between 2004 and 2012 will continue until end 2017), relief for rental payments on private tenancies (terminated for any new cases after 7 December 2010 - Individuals who were in receipt of the relief at 7 December 2010 may continue to claim it until 2017) the rent-a-room relief and relief for expenditure on significant buildings or gardens.

The relief applies to properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014. For the relief to apply, the property must be owned for a period of at least 7 years. The rationale for the relief was to encourage investment in Irish property at a time when the property market was at low ebb. <\/p><p>The Principal Private Residence Relief is available for individuals disposing of a house which was occupied by them as their only or main residence. The rationale for the relief is to ensure that the sale of a house, which will generally be replaced with another house, can be done on a tax-neutral basis.  <\/p><p>Farm restructuring relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2013. The rationale for the relief is to facilitate the consolidation of land holdings, thereby increasing the productivity of those land holdings. <\/p><p>There is no statistical information available to the numbers availing of the Principal Private Residence relief and the farm restructuring relief or their cost to the Exchequer.

NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity in this respect.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  NAMA is not a property developer.\u00a0 NAMA's role in relation to new housing output is, like a bank, that of a secured lender which makes a commercial decision to advance funding to maximise its return.\u00a0 As a secured lender, NAMA provides funding to its debtors and receivers where it is shown that this will increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.\u00a0 Residential projects funded by NAMA are delivered by NAMA's debtors and receivers who are subject to the same planning requirements as all other applicants in the planning process, including Part V legislation which requires the provision of 10% of their housing units for social housing.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Government recently amended Part V to remove the ability of developers to account for their social housing commitments through cash payments to local authorities and furthermore to ensure that the social housing will be located predominantly on the site of the original developments, not off-site as had been a feature of Part V since its introduction.\u00a0 NAMA debtors and receivers will fulfil their Part V obligation to deliver 10% of residential units in the form of on-site social housing units. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA has stated publicly its intention to facilitate, where feasible, the provision by its debtors and receivers of future Part V housing on NAMA-funded developments through its social housing SPV, NARPS.\u00a0This is a very important initiative, which means that NAMA, as opposed to the relevant local authority, will, in many cases, bear the up-front capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates it funds and that such housing will, in line with Government policy be aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing, be delivered on-site. <\/p>  <p>  Any delivery via NARPS, through Part V or otherwise, must\u00a0be on a commercial basis in line with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.\u00a0 In this regard, NARPS leases properties to either local authorities or approved housing bodies on the basis of commercial long-term lease arrangements which include an option for the local authority or approved housing body to buy the leased unit. <\/p>  <p>  Part V agreements are facilitated through the Planning Process and the design and planning specification of new houses and apartments are determined in the planning consent by reference to national and local policy and standards.\u00a0 NAMA does not own properties, is not a developer and NAMA is not a planning applicant in any instance so NAMA is not a direct party in the planning process, so while it may facilitate development, NAMA\u00a0does not negotiate housing specification with local authorities as this is a reserved function of the planning process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  NAMA has already played a very important role in facilitating on a commercial basis the supply of houses and apartments from within its existing portfolio for social housing.\u00a0 By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers under this initiative and NARPS, alongside the direct leasing or sale by NAMA debtors and receivers, is an important mechanism in ensuring this supply.\u00a0 Properties are leased by NARPS to approved housing bodies on the basis of long-term leasing arrangements.\u00a0 The NARPS lease provides, typically, for up to an average 20% discount to market rents, with the rent fixed for the first six years, and reviewed every three years thereafter, and includes an option for the approved housing body to purchase the property outright after a number of years at market value.\u00a0 The discount reflects the fact that the local authority and\\or approved housing body take full responsibility for property maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the lease.\u00a0 NAMA expects to have delivered close to 800 units out of end-2015 figure of 2,000 through the NARPS mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  The 2,000 units that will be delivered by NAMA from within its existing portfolio by the end of this year for social housing equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V in the years between 2002 and 2011.\u00a0 This underlines the important contribution that NAMA has already made in this area.\u00a0 It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments from within its existing portfolio available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Decisions relating to the disposal of the social housing portfolio leased by NARPS or to the possible dissolution of NARPS will be a matter for the NAMA Board to make at the appropriate time in the future. However, possible options could include selling the SPV at market value as part of NAMA's ongoing deleveraging, in which case a market participant would keep the long term lease arrangements with local authorities in place, or allowing local authorities to buy the properties from NAMA.<\/p>  <p>  While there may be\u00a0commercially attractive opportunities in the social housing sector, any such opportunities are based upon the\u00a0current social housing delivery model of\u00a0direct Exchequer subvention.\u00a0\u00a0As previously  stated, NAMA cannot provide that subvention.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is clear however that the social housing supply problem is a subset of the wider supply problem in the property market and NAMA's funding commitment in terms of commercially viable residential output will be part of the overall housing solution, although it can only part of the solution.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Looking at the private market, NAMA debtors and receivers control only about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area and accordingly, market participants who control the other 70% of the sites also have a major role to play if the supply\/demand imbalance is to be addressed in the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is examining what role it can play in supporting increased output by the wider development sector and in particular is examining how to address infrastructure deficits that are holding up the supply of commercially viable new housing in the main urban growth centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[44558\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000059#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for re-instatement, following retirement on grounds of ill-health, with prior notice granted since 2004; the legislation and rules or procedures under which they were granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware there is no provision in the legislation to allow for the reinstatement to the Civil Service of a former civil servant other than by way of competition.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy, therefore, that no applications for re-instatement, following retirement on grounds of ill-health, with prior notice, have been granted by my Department since 2004. <\/p>  <p>  Where an officer retires on grounds of ill-health the procedures are set out in Circular 22\/07, titled, Ill-Health Retirement from the Civil Service.

This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and to expedite discharges from hospital efficiently. <\/p><p>The HSE has provided details of the location of the 301 winter capacity beds and number of beds open to date as set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Hospital<\/th><th>Total Proposed July 2015<\/th><th>Total No. Beds open on 30\/11\/15<\/th><th>Total No. Beds open on 4\/12\/15<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>RCSI<\/td><td><div>44<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>44<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OLOL Drogheda<\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Connolly<\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IRELAND EAST<\/td><td><div>79<\/div><\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><td><div>59<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SVUH<\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Loughlinstown<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny\u00a0<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cappagh<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN MIDLANDS<\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>UL<\/td><td><div>27<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><div>27<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SOUTH SOUTH WEST<\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CUH\u00a0<\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic, Mercy University Hospital<\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SAOLTA<\/td><td><div>59<\/div><\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Merlin Park<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portiuncula<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CHILDREN&rsquo;S HOSPITAL GROUP<\/td><td><div>28<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CUH Temple Street<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght (Childrens)\u00a0<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GRAND TOTAL<\/td><td><div>301<\/div><\/td><td><div>106<\/div><\/td><td><div>176<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000063#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Sl&aacute;inte","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000063#WRH02550"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[44503\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000063#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"c&eacute;n polasa&iacute; at&aacute; aige i leith seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sl&aacute;inte ar na hoile&aacute;in amach &oacute;n gc&oacute;sta; cad at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige maidir leis an bpolasa&iacute; sin a chur i bhfeidhm; cad iad na socruithe at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige lena chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh altra l&aacute;naimseartha c&oacute;naithe ar Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, Co.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs. As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy. Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000063#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Groups","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000064#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[44541\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000064#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the Saolta Hospital Group review of accident and emergency services at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe in County Galway, including its purpose and its completion date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

From 1845 onwards model schools were established and managed by local inspectors. Model schools were found to be an unduly expensive method of training teachers, and their use for this purpose ceased from about 1883 onwards, the schools continuing to function as ordinary schools.  The functions of the National Education Board were taken over by the Department of Education and the model schools continued to be managed by inspectors and funded by the Department.  The Education Act 1998 placed the patronage of schools on a statutory basis. The Minister as owner of the model schools became the Patron of the model schools in accordance with the terms of the Act.  The schools operate as Catholic or Protestant schools in accordance with the historic traditions that go back to their foundation and the community to be served at the time they were established. The Deputy will be aware that under the Equal Status Act, schools are not permitted to discriminate in admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act.

The Paris agreement should provide an enabling platform for all Parties to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient sustainable development taking account of national circumstances and changes in those circumstances over time. The Agreement and supporting decisions should put the world on a collective pathway to limit the average global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An ambitious agreement is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests &ndash; firstly, it will protect us from the impacts of climate change; secondly, it will allow us to pursue transition to a low-carbon future on a level playing field with other countries; and finally,   some of Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries from a development perspective are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. <\/p>  <p>The current negotiations are challenging for all countries and compromises will be required.

The overall programme will be funded from NAMA&rsquo;s own resources and will lead to the development of an estimated 20,000 units by 2020, mainly in the Greater Dublin area where the current residential supply shortage is most acute. Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments and this includes policy relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.As such, I expect 10% of the output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units,to become available for social housing. <\/p><p>NAMA sourced units are brought into social housing use through existing delivery mechanisms including the Social Housing Investment Programme, the Capital Acquisition Scheme and the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).

The current average monthly cost of operational NAMA units leased by Approved Housing Bodies or local authorities, and funded by SHCEP, is &euro;770 per unit per month. Monthly leasing arrangements under the SHCEP achieve significant discounts on market rents and are subject to regular rent reviews. In the case of NAMA related properties, average discounts achieved are in the region of 17% for houses and 12% for apartments. In addition, under these arrangements, rents are fixed for the first six years. <\/p><p>In the case of properties purchased, my Department does not distinguish the financing of NAMA sourced units from other sources of social housing supply.

The majority of this number, 46,584 (52%), were found to be dependent on rent supplement and were therefore already supported in terms of housing by the State.The results of the 2013 Assessments are based on a comprehensive review of households on housing lists on a set date, which involved local authorities contacting individual households to confirm their continued requirement and qualification for social housing support. <\/p><p>All households which qualified for social housing support prior to 1 April 2011 were subjected to a full review to ascertain whether they met the new requirements under the 2011 Regulations, while those which qualified after 1 April 2011 were reviewed so as to ensure their continued compliance with the 2011 Regulations.<\/p><p>The 2013 figure is of course subject to on-going fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying. To take a snapshot of housing need in any given county, at a point in time in 2015, and compare it to the 2013 data, which was compiled as a result of rigorous analysis, has methodological weaknesses, which would distort the overall picture of need. <\/p><p>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s overall response, a shortage of supply is at the heart of the current challenges in the housing sector and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy  , published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting the estimated residential demand of 25,000 units per annum are resolved. My Department and other relevant Government Departments and agencies are actively implementing the range of commitments set out therein. In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020. 90% of these units will be in the greater Dublin area, with approximately 75% of the units being starter homes. <\/p><p>With regard to social housing delivery, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out clear, measurable actions to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the social housing list. The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing, with associated delivery targets of over 33,000 units across both Capital and Current programmes. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme almost &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan - Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021.<\/p><p>The unprecedented support and funding being allocated to bring vacant and boarded-up social housing units back into use is a notable example of the Social Housing Strategy&rsquo;s focused and realistic approach. Over 2,300 units were delivered in 2014, and I expect 2,500 units to be completed in 2015. <\/p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy. There are currently more than 5,400 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of household in 18 local authority areas. Dublin City Council is also implementing a HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities.<\/p><p>In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No.4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare and Meath County Councils with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighbouring Dublin areas. These regulations also provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council, where this is necessary to source suitable accommodation for a household that is qualified for social housing support.<\/p><p>On 10 November 2015, Government approval was given to a package of measures to address rent stability and housing supply. The measures will act to stabilise rents in the short to medium term while the additional supply of housing comes on stream. In relation to rent stability, the measures were given effect by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015. This Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. <\/p><p>Details of the full package of new rent stability and housing supply measures are available at the following link:<i>. <\/i><\/p><p>Cognisant of the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market, Budget 2016 provided for an affordable rental pilot scheme, with &euro;10 million being made available.

Details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department and will be completed by end-year, for rollout in early 2016.<\/p><p>Through these and other actions delivered to date under the Social Housing StrategyMinister Coffey and I have been actively supporting all local authorities to increase the supply of social housing to meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list, with flexibility to meet future demand.

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict   site. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. <\/p>  <p>Derelict sites throughout the State, particularly in urban areas, continue to remain a focus for my Department, and whereas the administration of the legislation at local level is a matter for the relevant local authority, my Department updates, on an annual basis, a Schedule of Urban Areas designated by local authorities as areas in which the derelict site levy can be applied in line with the provisions of the Act. The latest update of this Schedule (for 2015) is nearing completion. <\/p>  <p>The recently enacted Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced a new measure, the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development and use of vacant, underutilised sites in urban areas . When it becomes operational from 2019 onwards, it is envisaged that the levy will be instrumental in bringing vacant, underutilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes. To avoid a double levy situation in the case of any individual site, the Act provides that the derelict site levy shall not be payable in respect of any land on which the vacant site levy will be payable.   <\/p>  <p>Town and village renewal is being supported on an on-going basis by the suite of measures introduced by the Government as set out in   the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s recent Parliamentary Question No. 235 of 5 November 2015 on the matter, and in my more recent reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Topical Interest Debate motion on 11 November 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Paper on Energy Policy","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM00550"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[44487\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he will publish the energy policy White Paper, if it deals with micro-generation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">I intend to publish the White Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland on 16 December.  <\/font><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The White paper will discuss the role that micro-generation can play in transforming and enhancing the way homes, businesses, communities and citizens use energy. <\/font><\/p><p>In addition, on 31 July, 2015 the Department launched a consultation on a new support scheme for renewable electricity.

It is important to\u00a0reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement local authorities' own resources.\u00a0\u00a0In this context,\u00a0I am emphasising to\u00a0Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources, towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sc&eacute;imeanna Taca&iacute;ochta &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM02550"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[44502\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121000067#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an dtabharfaidh s&iacute; sonra&iacute; faoin taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; &aacute; cur ar f&aacute;il ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta do chomhlacht i nD&uacute;n na nGall (sonra&iacute; tugtha) agus gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta&iacute; an chomhlachta curtha ar fionra&iacute; go sealadach le d&eacute;ana&iacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"959","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>Tuigim &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta go bhfuil r&eacute;imse taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; - deontais caipitil agus marga&iacute;ochta den chuid is m&oacute; - curtha ar f&aacute;il acu don chomhlacht at&aacute; luaite ag an Teachta &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an comhlacht in 2008.
