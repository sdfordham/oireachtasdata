The Minister has undertaken to complete a detailed intervention strategy that will be submitted to Government in mid 2015. This process is complex and will include close examination of issues such as:<\/p><p>- The appropriate ownership model for the infrastructure;<\/p><p>- Whether there will there be a single contractor or multiple contractors to build the infrastructure;<\/p><p>- The potential cost of the intervention;<\/p><p>- Funding options;<\/p><p>- The appropriate duration of the contract; and<\/p><p>- How the service quality is to be measured and assured.<\/p><p>Because a very competitive procurement process is anticipated, it would be neither advisable nor appropriate to speculate about potential costs at this stage and it is preferable to allow the market players bid what they deem an appropriate price, taking account of the Government's decisions on the key issues, such as those I have already outlined.<\/p><p>There are a number of different perspectives in relation to the Deputy's reference to job creation.  There will obviously be jobs created during the construction and deployment of a new high-speed network.  The precise numbers will be very much a matter for the successful bidder or bidders to determine, particularly as it is very likely that the contract with the State will contain clear deadlines for the completion of this work.<\/p><p>More importantly, the delivery of high quality reliable broadband to every premises in Ireland will open up new job opportunities right across the economy.  The digital economy currently represents 5% of GDP and is one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy.  Irish consumers spend around &euro;700,000 per hour, 24 hours a day online and the digital industry supports almost 100,000 direct and indirect jobs<\/p><p>The importance of focusing on digital and its potential to contribute to economic growth and job creation cannot be under-estimated. In a fully functioning digitally enabled economy, research from McKinsey suggests that for every job displaced by digital, 1.6 additional jobs will be created.  Research also shows that companies which have a meaningful online trading presence grow twice as fast, export twice as much and employ twice as many people.  Ensuring that all businesses have access to reliable broadband is therefore important.  It will also allow the opportunity for new digital enterprises to emerge. <\/p><p>In delivering a reliable high speed network the Government aims to catalyse employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas, which heretofore may have struggled to create and sustain employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[10514\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will report on the consultation process with interested parties on the new energy policy document that is due to be published this summer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>An extensive consultation process was undertaken on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland following the publication of the Paper on 12 May 2014.

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  Transitioning to greater use of renewable energy is important for sustainability.  Using our indigenous resources is also important given that we currently import 89% of our total energy use including all of our oil, and over 95% of our gas. In 2013 we spent approximately &euro;6.7 billion on imported energy.  Keeping some of that &euro;6.7 billion in our own economy would facilitate investment, growth and jobs, and enhance our balance of payments.<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of policies in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  To date, wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. <\/p>  <p>  Part L of the Building Regulations supports the uptake of renewable heat and the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction from 2016 of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme and grant support for the purchase of electric vehicles underpin the deployment of renewable energy in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2020, the October 2014 European Council endorsed a binding EU target of at least 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2030 compared to 1990. In addition, an EU target of at least 27% is set for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030, and an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% is set for improving energy efficiency in 2030 compared to projections of future energy consumption.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland intends to make a cost-effective, achievable and fair contribution to these high level EU goals.  The Department is overseeing detailed and rigorous energy system and economic modelling to identify the contribution which is appropriate for Ireland, taking account of our specific economic circumstances.  This analysis will address issues such as the quantum of additional renewable electricity we should seek to achieve by 2030, the technologies that should be supported in this regard, and the level at which any future supports should be set.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":14,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[10232\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200045#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to provide priority to those areas which have had little or no broadband service to date in seeking tenders to implement the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

The Minister has no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.<\/p>  <p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.<\/p>  <p>  This policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects are not permitted as they would increase costs for all energy consumers.<\/p>  <p>Under the CER&rsquo;s policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.

The creation of the portfolios was informed by the resource available, the technological readiness of the various generation technologies and cost required per generated unit based on connection costs, construction costs and operating and maintenance costs. The mapping for the analysis also assessed the deployment potential based on where the resource was and an overview of environmentally designated areas.<\/p>  <p>  It was following this study that it was decided to pursue 40% renewable electricity in Ireland by 2020. The study concluded that, based on assumptions set out in the Report, wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the abundant wind resource means that each unit of installed generation capacity generates more units of electricity and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, various reports and analyses have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices.  The ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA), the SEAI and EirGrid have undertaken such studies.  The ESRI and IWEA studies both looked at the 2020 position, while a joint SEAI and EirGrid study looked at the position in 2011.  The SEAI and EirGrid study found that because wind reduces the cost of wholesale electricity when wind is available on the system, the effect of the PSO was cancelled out and the cost was effectively zero.  While this is true for 2011, it is acknowledged that a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrading is required to achieve the 2020 target.  The ESRI study found that wind is a hedge against high fossil fuel prices. In that regard wind also provides security of supply benefits along with climate and sustainability benefits.<\/p>  <p>  An IWEA member survey in 2014 indicated that 3,400 people are employed in the sector in Ireland.  A report published in 2014 by the ESRI and Trinity College Dublin, estimated direct and indirect employment under various realistic scenarios.  The report, which estimates multiple thousands of jobs depending on the scenario, is available on the ESRI's website. <\/p>  <p>  Renewable electricity generation in Ireland in 2012 is estimated by the SEAI to have saved 778 ktoe of fossil fuel, with an associated CO2 emissions reduction of 1.94 million tonnes. Of this, wind generation was the largest contributor, with savings estimated at 586 ktoe of fossil-fuel and a CO2 emissions reduction of 1.51 million tonnes. The value of the fossil fuels not consumed in Ireland in 2012 as a result of wind generation was estimated at &euro;177 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further &euro;11 million. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis undertaken by the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels.  This analysis highlighted the cost effectiveness of wind as a renewable energy source and informed a report which will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corrib Gas Field","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[10509\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when the Corrib project&rsquo;s gas supply will come online; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>Construction and testing of the infrastructure for the Corrib gas field development is nearing completion, with first gas anticipated in mid 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Leathanbhanda","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[10238\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"c&eacute;n uair a bheidh seirbh&iacute;s leathanbhanda ar luas ard ar f&aacute;il i gCill Chiar&aacute;in, i gCarna, ar an gCloch Bhreac agus i Seanadh Farrach&aacute;in, Co. na Gaillimhe; c&eacute;n &iacute;osteorainn leathanbhanda a bheidh ar f&aacute;il sna ceantair seo idir an d&aacute; linn; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>Is &eacute; is aidhm leis an bPlean N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Leathanbhanda a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil rochtain ar sheirbh&iacute;s leathanbhanda ardluais d&rsquo;ardchaighde&aacute;n ag gach saor&aacute;nach agus ag gach gn&oacute;, is cuma c&aacute; h&aacute;it a bhfuil siad lonnaithe.

The team consisted of representatives seconded on a full time basis from energy suppliers, the finance community and the retrofit industry, with the objective of developing proposals on how a BEF scheme might operate.  The team met on an ongoing basis from December 2012 to November 2013.  The project was overseen by a Steering Committee which met 12 times during 2013.  Following the completion by the project team of its work, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) was tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan for the design, development and execution of the scheme.  In that context, meetings between the SEAI and the Department continued during 2014.<\/p>  <p>  This year &euro;2 million in Exchequer funding has been made available under the Better Energy Communities Scheme to pilot and evaluate innovative financing schemes in a community setting.  The Better Energy Communities Scheme is application led, with a closing date of 20 March 2015.  Applications will be evaluated and projects selected on a competitive basis. A further &euro;1 million has been made available to fund other trials and measures on BEF. These trials are being administered by the SEAI.<\/p>  <p>  The results of these trials will inform the final design of the BEF Scheme, as will evidence from some schemes in operation internationally.  However, it is important to note that pay-as-you-save type schemes are relatively new in the countries where they exist.  Other countries tend to have multiple financial incentives in place, predominantly grant based, to underpin residential retrofit programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The work carried out to date in Ireland suggests that there is an understandable reluctance for households to take on additional debt and the success of a BEF Scheme would, therefore, require a compelling consumer proposition with accompanying incentives to capture consumer interest and drive action.  It is likely that this would require a combination of some Exchequer funded grants and a consumer financing offering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing Policy","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03500"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[10513\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the measures Department is considering in to prevent fracking here, in view of the recent US geological survey which found fracking waste to be the primary cause of a dramatic rise in earthquakes even in areas which previously did not experience earthquakes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>As has been outlined on a number of occasions, no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing, as part of an unconventional gas exploration or extraction project, until there has been time to consider the outcome of a major research programme, directed at examining the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which was commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<\/p>  <p>  The key questions that this research programme, which is to be carried out over a minimum period of two years, needs to answer are:<\/p>  <p>  - Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations be carried out in the island of Ireland whilst also protecting the environment and human health? and<\/p>  <p>  - What is &lsquo;best environmental practice&rsquo; in relation to such projects and operations?<\/p>  <p>  To this end this scientific research programme is based on the consideration of existing baseline data with respect to groundwater, air and seismicity and the potential implications and mitigations that are required to be considered in order to understand the possible environmental impacts of using this technology and whether or not it can be undertaken in an environmentally protective manner in accordance with the requirements of environmental law.<\/p>  <p>  I can once again confirm that no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing, as part of any unconventional gas exploration and extraction programme, until there has been time to consider the outcome of this EPA research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[10229\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200046#WRAAA03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the Shale Gas REC report published in early March by the European Commission, which revealed an alarming lack of consistency in regulation; and his further views to lobby within the EU for a European wide fracking ban.","asker":"1192","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>In January 2014, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation inviting Member States to follow minimum principles when applying or adapting their legislation applicable to hydrocarbons exploration or production using high volume hydraulic fracturing.

According to DSP figures on the numbers and\u00a0ages of\u00a0children in receipt of child benefit in 2013, there were approximately 489,500 children under 6 and 385,600 between the ages of 6 and 12. <\/p>  <p>  If tax relief at the standard rate of 20% was provided on the costs of childcare in respect of even half of these children, it would result in a cost to the Exchequer of in the region of &euro;340 million per annum in respect of those aged under 6 and &euro;290 million in respect of\u00a0those aged between 6 and 12; a total of &euro;630 million per annum. However, it must be borne in mind that these figures are extremely tentative and the real cost could be much higher.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that with a view to increasing childcare places available, an exemption from tax is already available on income of up to &euro;15,000 per annum\u00a0for individuals who mind up to three children in their own home.

The Bill protects borrowers by requiring the entities dealing with the borrower to be regulated. Dealing with the borrower is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. New owners of loan books who deal directly with borrowers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.<\/p>  <p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book is\u00a0not\u00a0a regulated entity in Ireland, the purchaser may voluntarily apply the Central Bank codes when managing loan books and may have internal complaints procedures in place. In the case of homeowners\u00a0whose loan is now owned by an unregulated entity, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) \u00a0may be applied in the same way that it would be by a regulated lender.\u00a0The CCMA is\u00a0designed to support co-operating borrowers and\u00a0provides extensive protection to customers in difficulty.\u00a0 It specifies the concrete actions lenders must take in the fair treatment of their customers in order to deal with their mortgage arrears situation as part of a resolution (or MARP) process; it also specifies the series of steps which borrowers need to take in order to engage with their lender.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, voluntary compliance is not enforceable and borrowers do not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Central Bank about complaints.

Inflation in the euro area has been below levels consistent with price stability for some time and, in fact, became negative last December and\u00a0remained negative in January and February. The fall in inflation, combined with the fact that inflationary expectations have begun to drift downwards, pose a risk to price stability.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, and with policy rates effectively at zero per cent, the ECB, on 9 March, launched an expanded asset purchase programme to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector debt securities will amount to &euro;60 billion. These monthly purchases are intended to be carried out from March 2015 until end-September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until inflation moves onto a path consistent with price stability. <\/p>  <p>  The ECB does not have a mandate to reduce existing debts or deficits of the private or public sectors.\u00a0In addition, monetary financing by the ECB of the public sector is prohibited under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

All such aid come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines entered into force on 1 July 2014.

This specifically relates to the aid rates for Capital Employment support under the Regional Aid Guidelines of 10%, 20% and 30% for small medium and large companies for the period 2014-2020.  All projects are subjects to assessment in terms of commercial, technical and market due diligence and should represent value for money in terms of the State&rsquo;s investment.  Five companies in the Athy region were approved payments by Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland also organised a presentation for the Athy Chamber in September 2014 with reference to the changes in the Regional Aid Map.  For reasons of confidentiality, Enterprise Ireland does not give details of individual grants approved to clients.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Counties covered by the Regional Aid Programme, including Kildare, are fully apprised of the Guidelines.

There was also engagement on the subject with a number of elected representatives in regions.  It is to be expected that the change will take time to translate into direct State aid to either IDA client companies or to new companies in the new regions included.

The inspection was arranged for 26 April 2013. On 25 April the person named contacted the inspecting officer to inform him that they would not allow the inspection to take place. In submitting an application under the Single Payment Scheme, applicants agree to permit officials of the Department to carry out farm inspection with or without prior notice. The person named was informed that failure to co-operate with the inspection would result in a nil payment. The person named continued to refuse to allow the inspection to be undertaken and as a result a 100% penalty was recorded against the relevant payments for 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The persons named requested a review of this decision.

The outcome of this appeal, which was to uphold the Department&rsquo;s original decision, was notified to the applicant on 28 November 2014.

This operation is supported by regional operations, of which Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin area, including the North Central Division.  Operation Creeper is a further and related operation, which assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements. <\/p><p>In so far as the overall national operation, Operation Fiacla, is concerned, as of 28 February 2015, this has led to the arrest of 12,374 persons with charges being brought against 7,010 persons nationally.  Within this total, and since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.  In so far as the North Central Division is concerned, there have been 899 arrests and 511 charges to date.<\/p><p>I am further advised that under Operation Creeper 167 persons were arrested in 2014.  These targets were selected from the list of Operation Acer targets as a result of high criminal activity and also as a result of patrolling in areas with high incidents of burglary.  Of those arrested, 46<b><\/b>were arrested in the North Central Division, of which 42 were charged with offences.  <\/p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that in addition to these policing responses, I am currently carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  In this regard I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place in relation to burglary.  This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities and an examination of legislative issues.  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am committed to tackling it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200056#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200056#WRL01850"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[10889\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200056#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for residency status will be accepted in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Galway whose parent is an Irish citizen and who first came to this country as a minor in the company of their parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned was registered in the State under Stamp 2 conditions valid until 15 August 2011.

The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the specific policing responses to the issues he has outlined are a matter for the Commissioner in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  A range of operations and other measures are in place in relation to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour, including drug dealing, in the North Inner City.  These include Operation Spire, which provides for a high visibility policing presence specifically on O&rsquo;Connell Street at critical times to address anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and related crime.  The operation is designed as a preventative measure and the area is patrolled by uniform patrols supplemented as required by Crime Prevention Unit and Divisional Crime Task Force personnel.  Additional resources are deployed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.<\/p>  <p>  Provisional Garda figures for 2014 show that in the North Inner City there were 16,338 searches under the Misuse of Drugs Act and that there were 871 detections for possession of drugs for personal use (an increase of 68% on 2013) and 830 detections for possession of drugs for sale and supply (an increase of 116% on 2013).  Early figures for the present year indicate continuing Garda success in detecting drugs offences.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the displacement of drug related activity to other parts of the North City I am advised that local Garda management has increased the number of personnel attached to the divisional drug unit to counteract this recent trend.  I am assured that Garda&iacute; will continue to provide a pro-active response to drug dealing in residential areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Small Areas Policing Initiative which has been piloted initially in the North Inner City adds further to the local policing response.  The approach taken under this initiative involves assigning  responsibility to nominated Community Garda&iacute; for a specific Community Policing Area of 50 - 200 dwellings, aligned to the applicable Small Area as defined by the CSO.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any question of detailed Garda deployment and resource management, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to evaluate the scheme and consider its benefits as compared to other community policing models as well as its potential for implementation in other areas.  I expect to receive further updates in this regard on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Garda response to the specific issues raised by him form part of overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  In addition a new multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200057#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":408,"content":"<p>Question No. 157 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200057#WRM01550"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[10905\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200057#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if, further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 127 of 6 November 2014 and 27 of 25 November 2014, the replies to which failed to provide the information requested in respect of the case of a person (details supplied) in County Laois, it is possible to ascertain the precise current position regarding residency status or, in lieu thereof, if a freedom of information request will illicit the information, which has previously been made available in numerous similar circumstances by way of replies to parliamentary questions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year. These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.   In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities.

I am now looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services and I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.

The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999\/112 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance. <\/p>  <p>  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council have agreed in principle to address the identified weaknesses, through the provision of a single point of contact for all emergency calls in Dublin.  Under this agreement, all 999\/112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region will be routed through the National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght and all ambulances, whether DFB or NAS, will be dispatched from Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS medical director. <\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements will mean that the people of Dublin will get a better ambulance service.  Currently, where DFB do not have an ambulance available, they may or may not pass the call to the NAS.  Passing calls between call centres is not without risks. Calls may be delayed or worse, be missed.  Under the new arrangements, the dispatcher will be able to see every available ambulance in the region.  The nearest available ambulance, whether NAS or DFB, will be sent to the incident. <\/p>  <p>  Agreement in principle has now been reached with Dublin Fire Brigade unions on the integration of emergency ambulance call taking and dispatch.  It has also been agreed that DFB will continue to be fully involved in emergency ambulance service delivery and there will be no diminution of such services.<\/p>  <p>  Staff in Dublin Fire Brigade will be fully consulted before the proposed changes are implemented.  A Joint Forum within Dublin City Council, which will include Management and Union representatives, will be established to address issues regarding the control centre reconfiguration.

This represents the first small increase in overall ODA in six years.  Of this, &euro;476 million is administered under Vote 27 of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Irish Aid programme.  In deciding on the allocation of the budget, some small reductions were necessary across budget lines, because of prioritisation of commitments, the scale of humanitarian crises across the world and the rise in Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contribution to the European Development Fund (EDF).  These are all areas which are funded annually under Vote 27 in line with standard budgetary procedures. <\/p>  <p>  European Union Member States&rsquo; contributions to the EDF are on an assessed basis.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution key under the 11th EDF is set at 0.94% of the total funds comprising the EDF, and accordingly we will make a total contribution of &euro;32.76 million to the Fund in 2015, an increase of some &euro;9 million on our contribution in 2014.  Decisions on the allocation of EDF funds are made by an EDF Committee of representatives of all EU Member States, including Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is recognised internationally for its support for the NGO sector, and consistently channels the largest proportion of our ODA through NGOs of any major donor.  Around one third of the Irish Aid budget is channelled through NGOs, for humanitarian and development programs and projects.  The Programme Grant scheme for our largest NGO partners constitutes is the main individual funding stream, which supports long term development work. The budget for the Programme Grant is &euro;61.34 million in 2015, a reduction of 2.28% on 2014.  This is in line with budgetary reductions across the Irish Aid programme, including in our key partner countries.  <\/p>  <p>  The past year has witnessed a serious deterioration in the global humanitarian situation, as a result of conflicts in the Middle East and Africa and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  The needs are set to increase in 2015, with the situation becoming more complex and posing different demands.  <\/p>  <p>  Included in Ireland&rsquo;s overall ODA budget is a specific provision to enable Irish Aid to respond to emergencies and natural disasters when they arise.  We have increased this dedicated Emergency Humanitarian Assistance budget line from &euro;57.5 million in 2014 to &euro;58.5 million in 2015.  In addition, last year, there was an increase in the humanitarian funding made available by Irish Aid to Irish NGOs from &euro;16 million in 2013 to &euro;23 million in 2014.  We provide humanitarian funding to trusted NGO partners here in Ireland, as well as to key UN partners and the Red Cross\/Red Crescent, agencies capable of delivering assistance to large numbers of beneficiaries. We will continue to work with and support these trusted partners throughout 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme has benefited significantly from our NGO partners&rsquo; commitment to helping poor and vulnerable communities. The OECD Development Assistance Committee&rsquo;s positive peer review of the effectiveness of the programme last year gave strong recognition to Ireland&rsquo;s NGO partnerships. The peer review also recognised the Government&rsquo;s strategic management of the aid budget during challenging economic times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200065#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200065#WRU00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200065#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[10757\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200065#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on using the transition year in post-primary schools for the delivery of further education and training awards council level 5 older care course on an optional basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This funding is provided from 20% of Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) tenancy registration fee income.My Department has allocated almost &euro;29m to housing authorities since 2005 for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. Additional funding was provided in 2010 for once-off strategically-planned programmes of inspection known as &ldquo;Intensified Inspection Projects&rdquo;.  Funding for Intensified Inspection Projects was awarded where housing authorities agreed to undertake additional, targeted inspection activity, over and above what they would conduct as part of their usual inspection programme. <\/p><p>A total of 20 applications were received and Dublin City Council was awarded &euro;1,099,135 for their Intensified Inspection Programme which involved a commitment to carry out in excess of 8,500 inspections over a three year period. A recent report from Dublin City Council found that the majority of dwellings selected for inspection (which were pre-1963 multi-unit buildings and more likely to be in this category of accommodation) were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection. This programme of inspections has been extremely successful.  According to the most recent data available, 70% of the non-compliant properties have already been brought into compliance.  Enforcement action continues on the remainder, including legal action in certain cases. Dublin City Council commenced its intensified inspection programme in February 2012 and it is due to run until end March 2015.<\/p><p>The allocation of funding for Private Rented Inspections is reviewed annually and the allocation for 2015 will be approved shortly.  In 2014, &euro;2.5 million was allocated to local authorities to carry out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation and arrangements are being made for the payment of this funding in the coming months. The payments are based on actual inspection performance reported for the 12 months up to 31<sup><\/sup>December 2014. Funding in the amount of &euro;300,000 was also allocated in 2014 to defray the cost of legal enforcement incurred by local authorities.<\/p><p>My Department is currently collating 2014 inspection data and will publish those online in due course.

The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. <\/p><p>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.<\/p><p>In order for a property to be considered under the AHB-mortgage to rent scheme it must be purchased by an Approved Housing Body for less than &euro;<b>220<\/b>,<b>000<\/b>(per property) in the Greater Dublin Area and &euro;180,000 (per property) in the rest of the country.

This is set to increase in the context of meeting our renewable energy target of 16% by 2020. In this regard policies are in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy including the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, both of which can provide a route to market for indigenous resources. <\/p>  <p>  Although wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity in Ireland, there is potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio. To that end, the 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.<\/p>  <p>Furthermore, the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction, from 2016, of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The draft Bionergy Plan recognises that meeting the demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant benefits. Consequently, the draft Plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200071#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corrib Gas Field","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200072#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[11046\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200072#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when gas supplies from the Corrib Gas field will become available on the national grid; the extent to which various towns and villages throughout the country are likely to benefit from this source in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The NTA is examining what might be an appropriate PSO service to put in place subject to funding.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the NTA, in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann, is examining options to re-configure existing PSO services in the south-east in order to maintain socially necessary services to the affected areas following the withdrawal of Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the NTA on wider issues around transport in rural Ireland over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Subsidies","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":825,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[10955\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of money his Department has provided to Bus &Eacute;ireann in each of the past three years; the way this money is broken down, and the requirement there is for Bus &Eacute;ireann to have a social conscience regarding its routes in view of the State funding received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":826,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":827,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 300 and 301 answered with Question No. 298.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Roads Maintenance Funding","counter":828,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[10975\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031200073#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason funding under the regional and local roads investment programme to Louth County Council has been reduced for 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>Funding for the national, regional and local road network has been reduced significantly across the board in recent years; in 2008 funding was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million.\u00a0 Regional and local road allocations in 2015 have seen an overall reduction of 11% on the 2014 start of year figure (this 2014 figure included &euro;50 million in one-off stimulus funding).\u00a0Louth has not incurred a disproportionate reduction in regional and local road allocations.
