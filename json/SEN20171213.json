It has been in the pipeline for well over a decade and I am raising it this morning because a Fine Gael Deputy for Donegal recently said the Government was steadfast in its commitment to the project, but omitted to say that when the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Transport he reduced the capital funding allocation from &euro;450 million to &euro;50 million.  I do not think that can be described as \"steadfast commitment\" to the project on the part of the Fine Gael Government.  I am pleased that the current Minister, Deputy Ross, has made this project a priority but he is constrained by the decision taken by Deputy Varadkar when he was Minister.  This project is vital to the north west region, particularly in light of Brexit and the constraints Brexit will bring to bear in Donegal.  While we do not know the full implications of Brexit yet, it will certainly not be economically beneficial for the north west region.<\/p> <p>There is a tentative commitment to provide money and a huge amount in capital spend will be required but it is absolutely essential to the entire north west region.  I do not know if there is any scope to seek additional moneys from the European Union as a result of Ireland standing firm with Europe in recent negotiations.  One might argue that the European Union was using Dublin to get at Britain, to some extent.  Irrespective of that, there is a case to be made at European level, in the context of the peace process and concerns over Brexit, for additional moneys to be ring-fenced for capital infrastructure investment in Border regions, particularly in Donegal and particularly for this project.<\/p> <p>I travelled from Donegal last night, a dark dreary night, and the north part of the road, which is a stretch of some 42 miles, is dangerous and difficult to travel along.

The average commute is less than 50 km per day.  Undoubtedly, the bulk of commutes can be travelled via electric vehicles.  Sadly, my part of the country still does not have the level of employment to ensure that people do not have to commute substantial distances, but the Government is determined through supporting regional and rural development to ensure that there are jobs in our regions so that people do not have to commute to the cities.<\/p> <p>I was interested in the Senator's point about the UK legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#B00800","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The Minister is aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#B00900","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It will feed into a task force that has been established between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department, namely, the low-emissions vehicle task force, which I will discuss in a moment.<\/p> <p>In May, the Government approved the publication of the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030.  This framework sets an ambitious target that, by 2030, all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will have zero emissions or be zero-emission capable.  In November, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and I furthered this ambition by pledging to work together to ensure that all passenger cars sold in Ireland from 2030 onwards would be zero-emission vehicles, full stop.<\/p> <p>The national policy framework recognises the benefits that electric vehicles can provide in assisting Ireland to achieve energy efficiency, renewable energy and climate mitigation targets.  One of the main commitments in the framework is to ensure that levels of access to refuelling or recharging infrastructure will not act as a barrier to the uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles.  By setting minimum levels of provision for refuelling infrastructure, the framework works to provide a supportive and enabling environment for suppliers and consumers.<\/p> <p>The provision of electric vehicle infrastructure, particularly the availability of public charging points, is a key focus of the work of the low-emissions vehicle task force.  The task force is co-chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department and is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle recharging.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Currently, there are almost 70 fast chargers in Ireland out of a total of around 900 chargers.  I intend to increase that number significantly.  In Budget 2018, I secured a doubling of my Department's budget for electric vehicle supports from &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million.  A key focus for this is on increased spending in the development of the charging network, with a particular emphasis on fast chargers.<\/p><p>The low emissions vehicle task force is working to develop the best method for supporting the roll-out of fast chargers.  In this regard, a stakeholder workshop was held last month to explore issues related to the future requirements for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  This workshop included representatives of EV owners, the motor industry, local authorities and other key stakeholders. This is a complex area.  It is important not just that we meet the current needs and demands, but that we future-proof this network.  A simple initiative that has been taken within my own local authority, by Roscommon County Council, is painting the parking spots for electric charging points because of the number of people who have been parking in them and blocking those up has limited the substantial network that we have across this country.  For the size of our country, we have one of the most extensive networks of public electric charging points within the European Union.  I accept that we need to look at the issue of fast chargers.<\/p><p>Early in the new year, I expect the low emissions vehicle task force to complete its work on fast chargers and recommend how best to support their roll-out.  It is likely that state aid clearance will be required for any Exchequer support.  As a result, I expect the roll-out of fast chargers to commence in the second half of 2018.  In October of this year, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published a decision that envisages the future operation of the charging infrastructure on a commercial basis and the sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks in the long term.  However, the continued ownership and operation of the charging network by the ESB for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for.  This will safeguard those who rely on public electric vehicle charging infrastructure and result in as little impact to the network as possible in the short to medium term.<\/p><p>It also enables the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.  In addition to the existing charging network and the initiatives led by my Department, large car manufacturers are also expected to become involved in the provision of high-powered infrastructure.  A number of providers are likely to emerge onto the Irish market in the coming years.  For example, Nissan already has a number of charge points available through its dealer network and Tesla has recently opened its first supercharger location in Ireland.<\/p><p>I thank Senator O'Donnell for raising this important issue.  I reassure him that expansion of Ireland's fast charging network is a key priority for me.  I also want to say, and this is important, from 1 January 2018 a new grant scheme is being introduced through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for putting in domestic charging points.  Up to now for new vehicles that were purchased the ESB provided that service to the public.  From 1 January 2018, that grant scheme is now going to be available for new vehicle purchases but also the purchase of second-hand electric vehicles.  This has been a reason quite a number of people have been looking for charging points.  A number of representations Members will have received in their offices are from constituents who are buying second-hand vehicles and who require the public charging infrastructure to charge the vehicle at the moment.  They will now, if they purchase the vehicle from 1 January, be eligible to have a charging point installed in their own home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#B01000","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We are three minutes over time, so the Senator should be very brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#C00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I want to thank-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#C00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We have eight minutes and we have 11 done, and there are other matters backing up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#C00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for dealing with this.

Its principal focus is to recommend an evidence-based national model for speech and language therapy provision in primary and social care that focuses on children aged up to 18 years.  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits that a new speech and language service in schools will be established to support young children as part of a more integrated support system.  The report of the HSE's review group will inform a new model being developed by a joint working group that is led by the Department of Education and Skills.  Funding of &euro;2 million was allocated under budget 2018 to develop and implement a pilot model.<\/p><p>It is evident that there has been and continues to be a clear commitment by this Government to enhance the provision of speech and language therapy services, particularly for children.  Focused interventions, supported by dedicated funding for early intervention and prevention services, not only greatly benefits children they also go a long way to address the concerns of parents that their children receive timely and appropriate services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#C01100","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

On the one hand, as education spokesperson I know people go to college and upskill.  On the other hand, employers say there is a shortage of people for certain skills.  I give the two examples of chefs and hotel managers.  Some people who have a small business approached me and told me that they got no response to an advertisement that they placed in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and displayed in one of their windows seeking a chef.  The shortage of chefs has been acknowledged across the board and the Restaurant Association of Ireland always mention the shortage.  There was a man here from Nepal who came to Ireland as a student.  As he was a student here he was entitled to work 20 hours per week so he started working in the restaurant as a trainee chef.  The restaurant then paid for him to go to college and now wants to employ him as their chef because he has all of the skills. <\/p><p>On the other side of the coin, people who own a hotel came to me about a similar matter.  They have a man who is well qualified as he has a degree in hotel management and business studies and other qualifications.  He has been in Ireland on a stamp 2 form since 2003.  His permit kept being renewed and he was able to work so many hours a week.  As he is very qualified and gets on very well with the hotel's customers they want to make him a full-time employee.  Unfortunately, hotel management does not form part of the critical skills list and he does not qualify for an employment permit.  The scheme was established when there was a shortage in certain areas but it is time the list was expanded.  We should consider the areas that are experiencing shortages, particularly areas where employers cannot find people to take up jobs.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#D01000","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to be in the Seanad today.  This is my first time in the new Seanad Chamber and I compliment the Cathaoirleach on the wonderful work that has been done to adapt the ceramics room to suit the needs of the Seanad.  The room looks lovely and I wish Senators well in their sojourn here in this temporary accommodation.  I was involved in the works in my previous role as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I am delighted to see everyone here today in this wonderful building.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to be here in my new role as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and thank everyone for their good wishes.  I thank Senator Byrne for raising this important issue.  Ireland's overarching labour market policy is to promote the sourcing of skills and labour needs from within the workforce of Ireland and the European Economic Area.  The employment permit system is ordered by the use of lists that determine those occupations which are highly demanded and in short supply in Ireland.  Also, those which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits as the domestic and European Economic Area, EEA, labour markets are should be able to meet demands.<\/p> <p>Changes to these lists are made on the basis of research undertaken by the National Skills Council, in tandem with a public consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet skills needs.  Chefs are currently on the ineligible list for employment permits, with the exception of executive chefs, head chefs, sous chefs and specialist chefs who specialise in non-EEA cuisine.<\/p> <p>In 2015, the expert group on future skills needs, EGFSN, study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector indicated a rising skills demand in line with the economic recovery.  The EGFSN made a series of recommendations to avoid skills shortfalls as the sector grows.  A hospitality skills oversight group, comprising representatives from public and private stakeholders, drives and co-ordinates actions to address the long-term needs of the sector.  Work is under way to increase the supply of chefs through training initiatives such as the development of culinary apprenticeships.  In parallel, my Department is actively engaged with stakeholders in the hospitality sector to develop a solution to enable the removal of chefs from the ineligible list.  I expect the matter will be resolved shortly as part of the current occupation skills review and I have asked my officials to expedite completion of the report.<\/p> <p>Hotel managers are also on the ineligible list for employment permits.  The National Skills Council has not identified a skill shortage with this occupation.  It does acknowledge that employers are experiencing difficulties in retaining such staff.  While the emphasis is on developing skills in the Irish labour market, the role migration can play is being kept under review.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As the economy improves it is critical that our economic migration employment permit system can continue to respond to emerging needs.

Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of upskilling our resident workforce.  The work of the hospitality skills oversight group in driving practical actions and collaboration to address the skills needs of the hospitality sector is to be welcomed.  It is my priority to ensure the Irish labour market is positively affected by the movement of skills into the country to ensure that labour shortages in key sectors do not stall economic growth.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>For example, in recent years meat deboners and heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers have been removed from the ineligible occupation list in response to the labour needs of those sectors.  I know from discussions with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, that there were issues regarding the shortage of skilled HGV drivers.  I know the position remains challenging but I am delighted that in my own county of Monaghan, we were able to initiate a HGV driver apprenticeship programme, which is being rolled out in conjunction with Cavan-Monaghan Education and Training Board.  That is a very welcome development and it will help to equip people with the necessary skills for HGV driving.<\/p> <p>I want to see more of this because our priority, first and foremost, should be to ensure that Irish workers have the necessary skills to take on these sorts of jobs.  In the short term, that might not always prove possible and in that regard the role migration can play in addressing the skills shortages is being reviewed by my Department to ensure it is fully supportive of Ireland's emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in areas such as the hospitality sector, as Senator Byrne has highlighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#E00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I add my congratulations to the Minister on her new role and elevation, I should think.

It is mid-week and the number is exorbitantly high.  Patients on trolleys in the south of the country comprise 37% of this number.

Up to November 2017, 82,459 people had been left on hospital trolleys.  We are in danger of 2017 becoming the first year that the number of people on trolleys tops 100,000.  It is important to remember that each one of these figures represents an individual with a family.  I commend the approach of the homelessness campaign which protested outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday.  The main theme of the #mynameis campaign seeks to change the attitude towards homelessness figures, stressing that behind each figure is a real human being and each one is one too many.  We also heard the phrase homelessness is not normal.  This should also apply to people languishing on hospital trolleys.<\/p> <p>The Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, IAEM, estimates that between 300 and 350 patients die each year on trolleys.  It is awful to think that someone, who toiled and went through many things in life, might end their life on a hospital trolley.  At the rate we are going, many more people will actually end their time on this earth on a trolley.  It is shameful and a disgrace in a country that has wealth like ours.  If there was an outbreak of disease, there is no capacity left in the hospital system to deal with it.  I do not know what would happen.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in's policy document, Tackling the Trolley Crisis, seeks to resolve the crisis by using existing resources without seeking more capital spend.

How can one expect two full-time staff nurses take full responsibility for everything that happens in that department and for every individual who comes through its doors?

The school secretary is the first point of contact when one enters a school.  The secretary is a vital link between pupils, teachers and parents and many principals will say their school would not function properly without the school secretary.  Despite the important role they play, their terms and conditions leave a lot to be desired.  There are two groups of school secretary, those paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills and those paid out of the ancillary grant.  Both do the exact same job but they have very different terms and conditions.  The secretaries paid by the Department are public servants and they enjoy standard terms and conditions but the secretaries paid out of the ancillary grant are in a very different situation.  Their terms and conditions are at the discretion of the board of management.  School boards of management are under a lot of financial pressure and are limited in what they can do.  This group of school secretaries have to sign on during their holidays, whether at Christmas, summer or Easter, and this is very unfair.  Other support staff, such as SNAs, have better terms and conditions, which is right.  I would like this issue to be addressed as soon as possible as it is very unfair on school secretaries.  I would like the Minister to come into the House in the new year to outline his strategy to ensure school secretaries are given proper terms and conditions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#J00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I call on the Leader to hold a debate on our natural resources so that we can see where we are going and what our long-term plan is.

We need a debate on what we are doing with our natural resources.  Seaweed harvesting at the level proposed has never happened before in the British Isles.  There is great concern among the general public and we need to decide how we are going to police it.  One of the conditions of the licence is that it will be self-policed and no other organisation will be recording data about what is happening on the ground.  We need to have a debate with the line Minister, Deputy Damien English, and the Department needs to clarify how the licence is granted.  It needs to address issues such as advertising, informing the public and ensuring that policing of the activity is done by the itself, rather than the individual who holds the licence.  This can start a general debate about our natural resources and how we police them.  This is a test case and I hope the Minister can come to the House for a real debate and a detailed discussion on his plan.

This is reflected in the young scientist exhibition every year so the Minister should send somebody to study it.  It is one of the finest schools in the country.<\/p> <p>Senator Humphreys spoke about homelessness and housing.  I tire of the Minister being hammered constantly over not producing houses because one cannot build houses overnight.  We can look at historical facts but we cannot change what we have today.  However, we can insist that everybody on the team plays the game and we have a couple of people who are not playing the game, specifically, the banks.  Young people are coming to me all the time to tell me they have paid out tens of thousands of euro in rent and they have no way of establishing savings because they spend all their money on rent.  When they are provided with a deposit to buy a house or apartment, by relatives or somebody else, the bank will not give them a mortgage because they have no track record of saving.  They have a track record in paying rent and very often that far exceeds what they would pay on a mortgage.  We have to start looking at who is wearing the green jersey in regard to housing.  In my area of south Dublin an entire estate is almost complete but not one house is sold on it yet.  Why?  It is because the value of property is increasing by the week.  We have to do something in this regard too as it is plain, outright greed.  We could have people moving into those houses and freeing up other accommodation for the homeless.  There is a plethora of estates in south Dublin where that is happening.

My worry is that free GP care is not being expanded and rolled out further. Instead, it is being curtailed, and individual GPs are making their own decisions as to how much they will charge for something as simple as a blood test.

The Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport will be discussing the accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities today.  It is terrible that they have to be tough but this Government makes their lives tough.  Did the Members know that to travel in a wheelchair, one has to notify Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann 24 hours in advance that one will be taking the train?  It was announced earlier this year, as part of the national disability inclusion strategy, that there would be a pilot project that would reduce notice time to four hours for the DART.  Yes, a wheelchair user cannot simply decide to take a train.  There is beauty and charm to Irish stations, and I am certainly not advocating major restructuring work.  I am simply calling for some common sense.  We have mobile technology, we have the Internet.

This morning the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was in Lusk, reviewing a new social housing scheme of 74 houses.  The houses are rated A2, the top rating, and some of them are occupied already.  The Minister then went on to Donabate to turn the sod on a new road that will lead traffic from the centre of Donabate and allow passage down to Portrane.  It will also open up the lands there to more housing, private and social and affordable.  The housing is badly needed.  I concur with Senator Craughwell when he says that we need to acknowledge where progress is made.  Much more needs to be done, and we all accept that.<\/p> <p>A related issue I want to raise is the new National Forensic Mental Health Hospital there and the number of trucks passing through the centre of Donabate each day.  The planning permission was intended to ensure that these would not travel during school opening or closing times, because the footpath coming out of the school is very narrow and there is a danger to children.  However, concerned residents have sent me multiple pictures of lorries passing by at those very times, creating serious danger.  I cannot confirm whether those lorries are from the hospital site or from other developments, but I must raise the issue of enforcement.  When conditions are attached to planning permission, they must be enforced.  Fingal County Council is doing fantastic work and is leading the way in many respects, and it may need more staff to ensure that enforcement can be carried out.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to discuss this issue on a national basis because the enforcement of planning permission conditions, particularly traffic restrictions, affects areas right across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#K00800","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>On the matter Senator Reilly raised, it was a bit over-the-top for Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to make such remarks.

I also listened yesterday to property commentators.  They were saying that there would be an additional increase of up to 20% in the value of the houses along the Luas lines.  Many people may think this is welcome, but I hesitate, because this increased value will inevitably lead to an increase in property tax.  The street where I live was a run-down and semi-derelict 18th century street 40 years ago, when I bought the house.  I restored my own house to a high standard.  I rescued 35 North Great George's Street, turning it into a James Joyce Centre which is still very successful 20 or 30 years after it started.  I was personally involved in the positive change of ownership of 12 out of the 48 houses in the street.  I created a preservation society, which I have to say is absolutely excellent.  It has had a succession of chairpersons after me.  They have all worked hard.  We have made a great impact on that street.  It is now a desirable place to live.  Combined with the Luas and the very welcome redevelopment of Parnell Square, particularly the library moving into the Col&aacute;iste Mhuire premises, this will lead to an increase in the value of our houses.  This means that we will have to pay far more property tax.  This is grossly unfair and wrong, and I believe that property tax should and must be scrapped.  It is going right back to what James Fintan Lalor and his colleagues fought against, the practice of rack-renting.  When a tenant farmer dared to increase his profits, to increase his holding, to redecorate his little farm or to improve his living conditions, the landlord immediately slapped extra rent on him.  This is what is happening now, but it is not due to malign landlords, it is what our Government is doing to its own people.  It is wrong and it has to stop.  I would like to ask the Leader if we can have a debate on that in the new year.  I believe there are some parties, principally Sinn F&eacute;in, which have taken up this issue, and they are prepared to go to an election with one of their planks being removal of the property tax.  I think this is absolutely necessary in the interests of equity and fair treatment for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#K01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>With the Cathaoirleach's permission, I would like to welcome neighbours of mine from Dunamon in Roscommon; Mr. Brian Flynn, Ms Denise Flynn, and their children Meghan, Nathan and Suey, who are here for the first time in Leinster House.

I refer to a charge for fishing in rivers in my local area.  It is the only part of Ireland where there is a charge for fishing.  If Megan, Nathan and Zoe Flynn wanted to fish on their parents' land, they would have to pay a levy to the fisheries board.  That is wrong.  The ESB seems to have ownership and is acting like a latter day British landlord.  I have asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, to resolve this issue.  It applies to the River Suck and its tributaries, including Linbaun Lake.  Tourists to our area must pay a fishing levy but if they leave our area they do not have to pay such a levy.  That is not fair.  I would hope I would have the support of this House were I to table a motion to resolve this issue early next year.  As a former Minister, I find it very difficult to understand why the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has not addressed this matter given that it is in his bailiwick.  It would be very simple to resolve and Ministers should look after their own areas.  They always have done so in the past and always will do.  It has been a while since we had a Minister in our area.  The Suck valley centre in Athleague, county councillors and local people, as well as Donamon Castle are all arguing for this particular concession.  It is hard to believe that there is a levy of &euro;10 per day for a child to fish in Roscommon's rivers while down the road on the river Shannon, no levy applies.

I did not see the \"Prime Time\" programme but the issue he raised on the manner and behaviour of judges is one on which you have probably ruled, a Chathaoirligh, we have no direct say.  The Government is producing the Judicial Council Bill.  The Bill is before the Oireachtas.  It will promote and maintain excellence among the Judiciary in terms of their functioning and high standards in conduct and behaviour.  A judicial committee will be established to consider complaints against judges.  The point the Senator made is that we should expect all involved in any type of interaction to be courteous and polite irrespective of where that interaction occurs.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan has raised the matter of the National Rehabilitation Hospital on numerous occasions in the House.  The Minister has reopened several beds through the HSE.  We have had a debate on the matter in the House.  Senator Hopkins has raised this matter as well.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House, but perhaps Senator Boyhan could put in a request for a Commencement matter tomorrow to get his issue resolved.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys raised the matter of affordable housing.  I concur with his views completely.  There is need to see the scheme progress.  I know the Minister is committed to it.  To be fair to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, they are working on the scheme.  There is a need for affordable housing.  Airbnb is producing a knock-on effect.  I share the views of Senator Humphreys and I would be happy to have a debate on the matter in the new year on housing and Airbnb.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the #mynameis protest.  I agree with the Senator on this much in that we all need to see the attitude change towards homelessness in terms of the language used.  These people are citizens of our State.  They are men and women who, for whatever reason, are unable to provide for themselves or secure accommodation.  There is an obligation and responsibility on each of us to work to ensure that no person is left homeless, put out on the street or left sleeping rough.  This requires a co-ordinated effort with different interactions between different agencies.  Through the Minister, the Department and Rebuilding Ireland a complete package is available.  We want to see progress made in this area.<\/p><p>Senator Burke raised the issue of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015.  In particular, he raised the issue relating to section 5 and local authority members.  We will debate the matter when the Bill comes before the House.  The classification of county councillors in the same vein as Oireachtas Members, special advisors, chairpersons or chief executives of public bodies and those on remuneration at deputy secretary level in the public sector is somewhat mystifying.  The people who serve local authorities work part-time and do not have the same resources or supports that we and others have.  While we all want to see transparency, high standards and maintenance of the level of obligations, I believe that placing some local authority members in this category is a wrong move.  We will have that debate in the House.  I do not have an answer as to when the Bill will be brought back.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the important issue of school secretaries.  He is right to say they are one of the most important points of contact and engagement in the school.  I would be happy to have a debate on the matter in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of seaweed in Bantry Bay and the Minister granting the licence.  There is a dispute on the matter of harvesting that relates to the impact on kelp stock.  BioAtlantis was awarded the contract.  The issue has been coming up in France and Norway since the 1970s.  I imagine the Minister of State, Deputy English, would welcome the debate and I would be happy to arrange it for the new year.<\/p><p>I join Senator Craughwell in commending those in the school in Kinsale on their work and the approach they take.  Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of housing.  There is an obligation and a duty on our banks to work with all of us to provide mortgages and loans to keep people in their homes.  That is one piece of the jigsaw that needs to be further strengthened and enhanced, and I agree with Senator Craughwell in that regard.<\/p><p>Senators Feighan, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Reilly, made reference the issue of the state of Alabama and race, as you did, a Chathaoirligh, in your ruling.  I congratulate the new Alabama Senator, Doug Jones, on his victory and wish him well in his term in the US Senate.  Whatever our viewpoints on the issue that was discussed and adjudicated, to be fair, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in withdrew his remarks.  That was the right thing to do.  The issue that dogged that campaign is one that we can never condone or support.  Irrespective of our political viewpoints, we can say that the state of Alabama stood up for honesty and decency this morning.  That is evident in the result.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan also raised the issue of the \"Prime Time\" programme.  Again, I would be happy to have a debate about the issues of crime and bail in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made reference to the issues of GP care and primary care.  This is a central plank of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and Government policy.  I hope no member of the GP profession would unravel the free GP care that has been put in place.  We will have that debate in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Jennifer Murnane-O'Connor raised the important issue of transport equality for disabled people.  I fully concur with the Senator on the matter.  It beggars belief that, whether in public or private transport, there are issues around disabled access for people who require specialised entrances or vehicles.  It is important to have that debate in the new year and I would be happy to do that.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly also made reference to the issue of housing in Lusk.  I welcome the opening of the development today by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy.  The Senator also raised an issue around the new hospital in Donabate and traffic.  Perhaps he might get a response more quickly through a Commencement matter.  In any event, the issue is important to raise.<\/p><p>Senator Norris commented on the property tax.  The debate is one that I very much welcome.  As I said yesterday, it is important to welcome the Luas and the joined-up approach being taken in Dublin now.  The issue of property tax will not go away.  I know many Members have different viewpoints on the matter but we will have that debate on it in the new year.<\/p><p>I am not familiar with the remarks of Senator Leyden regarding the issue of the licence for the area he referenced in Roscommon.  It is important to have clarity and for the matter to be resolved.  I am sure he could arrange that by means of interaction with the Minister rather than a debate in the House.<\/p><p>Senator Mulherin raised the issue of Amnesty International and the rules of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  There has been controversy around Part IV of the Electoral Act 1997, as amended.  The matter is being investigated.  There is an onus on everyone to fulfil their obligations and comply with the rules of the State.  In the case of SIPO, there is a duty on all of us to uphold the law and provide for transparency.  That matter will not go away given that there is concern about the legislation, as written and enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#L03600","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>There are two separate views in SIPO.

As Senator Norris said, SIPO has raised concerns over the years in its annual reports.  The matter has been to the forefront in recent days and is unlikely to go away.  Clarity needs to be brought to the matter because there could be unintended consequences for other groups and organisations, including community councils or resident associations.

Possession or production of a public service card shall not be a mandatory requirement for the payment of a benefit.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to the House.  The issues I am speaking to in amendments Nos. 1 to 4 do not concern specifically the public services card itself but the manner in which it is being rolled out, the database to which it is attached and the procedures under which specified bodies are accessing the data.  I recognise that many of these issues will be examined in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill but the immediate concern is that the card is being rolled out in what I believe to be a heavy handed fashion.  We have been told that it is &quot;mandatory&quot; if not &quot;compulsory&quot; and, increasingly, we are hearing story after story emerging of those who are being denied access to essential services or supports which allow them to live a dignified existence if they are not willing to participate in the process by giving their data over to have it fed into the single customer view dataset.  This, of course, is where data gathered for the public services card goes.<\/p><p>During the summer we heard the case of the pensioner who was denied her pension and then later granted it despite strong avowals that she would not be able to access it and would have to forfeit it.  More recently, we have heard cases of students being denied access to important student grants made under SUSI which allow them to attend college.  We have heard of the multiple letters to people telling them they need to attend or may lose child benefit and essential payments.<\/p><p>I do not believe that the Department or the specified bodies, such as the Road Safety Authority in terms of the driver's licence, which are demanding people have a public services card are acting within the set boundaries.  We have not yet been satisfied that there is a legislative basis to allow the demand to be made and to allow for the mandatory possession of this card in order to access essential services.  We have not seen a satisfactory mandate and very serious concerns have been raised around, for example, the single customer view dataset.  Information obtained under the freedom of information regime highlights that the 2009 ministerial agreement which allows data to be shared between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not signed by a Minister.  That is a small concern in the bigger picture but it is an example of a lack of robustness in how this information is gathered, stored and shared.<\/p><p>More importantly, serious concerns have been expressed by the Data Protection Commissioner.  In response to questions posed, the Data Protection Commissioner received a number of answers from the Department and, subsequently, initiated a section 10 investigation.  This is the first time the Data Protection Commissioner has launched a section 10 investigation, which is an investigation into the storage, collection and sharing of data within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Of course, it also points to that wider question about the single customer view dataset.  This is a real concern but this is not the first Data Protection Commissioner to be concerned.  The outgoing Data Protection Commissioner also expressed extreme concern about how data was managed in the Department.  This is not to point at the Minister or any officials.  However, these are the concerns of those who we, as a State, appoint to guard us and ensure that the proper data standards are met.<\/p><p>My amendments seek to further clarify and underscore the situation.  I believe the Minister has the discretion to accept forms of identification other than the public services card.  I also believe that specified bodies do not have the power to insist on production of a public services card.  My amendments seek to clarify, lest there be any doubt, that there is the capacity to accept &quot;such other information or documentation as the Minister, an officer of the Minister or a payment service provider, as the case may be, may reasonably require for the purposes of authenticating the identity of that person&quot;.  It spells out that the reasonable requirement may not necessarily be the public services card.<\/p><p>For example, if the SAFE 2 standards are the Minister's primary concern, in determining eligibility for a payment it is at her discretion to demand that SAFE 2 standards be met on a single occasion.  I believe the Minister would probably have better sanction for demanding that the SAFE 2 standards are met in order to consider and determine eligibility for a payment.  Where the question mark arises is in the addition of that information into the single customer view dataset and in the subsequent sharing and accessing of that information by more than 40 specified bodies.  There are huge questions about whether those who give their data for the purposes of accessing a payment can be said to have agreed to the data being used for what is sometimes called excessive or additional processing by these specified bodies.  There is a question mark there.<\/p><p>In terms of the regulations which we, as a European community, are bringing into play from spring onwards, the general data protection regulation sets out clear parameters on the storage and processing of information and, crucially, on consent.  The bar that it sets is for full, fairly obtained and informed consent.  In terms of &quot;full&quot; and &quot;informed&quot;, the question is whether people have been fully informed as to all the uses the data they are given will be put.  In terms of fairly obtained, was the information gathered or compelled by threat?  If so, it will fall short of the standards of the general data protection regulation.  It is hard to see how the potential loss of payment, loss of access to education or loss of the right to drive would not be seen as a threat and an attitude of compulsion.<\/p><p>There may be many who voluntarily, willingly and perhaps enthusiastically sought a public services card.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, those who have been compelled, and who we hear of being compelled, or who are told this is the only form of identification which will be accepted, are having their rights effectively violated.  Subsequent to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, coming in during mid-spring next year, it will apply not only to the gathering but to the use of that data.  Therefore, those who are compelled to give their data, if those data are used subsequent to May or June, whenever the GDPR is initiated here in Ireland, will have a case.  The GDPR comes with very substantial fines, which go up to 4% of a body's turnover.<\/p><p>It is a very serious issue and this is why, in these amendments, I am effectively seeking to encourage the Minister to exercise her control and discretion to ensure we strive to ensure we are as compliant as possible going into that period and that we do not leave hostages to fortune in the future.  Effectively, we have seen the concerns raised by the Data Protection Commissioner and a doubling down of the roll-out.  This is an urge and a plea, effectively, for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Government, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to stop digging on the public services card because they are creating trouble for us down the line as a nation.<\/p><p>In terms of the question of fraud, which was the heavily used justification in regard to the risk of people presenting with the identification of others, we saw in the Committee of Public Accounts recently that the figures on fraud proved to be highly exaggerated, although there were concerns.  What had been reported to be fraud levels of 2% turned out to be 1.4% departmental error and just 0.6% fraud.  What tiny fraction of that can we assume to be based on the presentation of false identification?  Is the only way to recognise this false identification through the application of SAFE 2 and the rolling out of a hugely expensive public services card?  I believe the imposter argument at the front line of public services is a straw man.  I think the incidence is very small.  If a straw man is presented to us as policymakers, we need to challenge it because there is a far more robust and more serious threat on the other side.<\/p><p>Although I have spoken at length, I want to speak also to the amendments as a whole and I want to add specific sentences in regard to each amendment, and why I hope the Minister might accept them.  I recognise that, in the current world, data are mined and used as currency.  Many of the threats to citizens have been in terms of how their data are used by corporations.  As Europeans, we have taken a strong stand and I am very proud of Recital 169, which we have collectively produced.  However, even though it may mean changing historical practices, what we have done here with the public services card is a case of layering a new entity over historical practices rather than fundamentally rethinking how we do consent or how we gather data.  We need to hold ourselves to the highest standards in order that we can legitimately represent our citizens and protect their data in the wider data sphere, and in order that we can ensure that people feel empowered, even though they are living in the modern world and are accessing information.<\/p><p>I do not think those who oppose this are Luddites.  If anything, some of the people who have opposed this and spoken about their concerns are those who are most engaged with technology and who want to ensure we are acting in such a way that citizens are empowered around how their data are used and collected.  That is something we should aim for collectively.  Of course, there are also those who are very vulnerable and frightened and who have taken this card and expressed the view that they are not sure what they are signing up for, which they are not.  Those concerns have also come through to us.  For example, with regard to pensioners, we saw the case of a person who had been adopted and had to give excessive and inappropriate information in that context.<\/p><p>I believe it is already the case that the Minister has discretion to accept another form of authentication for identity.  Nonetheless, the first amendment seeks to spell that out and does this under a number of criteria in the later subparagraphs.  While there has been some ambiguity and we know that, under the European GDPR rules, one cannot make it compulsory for someone to share his or her data, we have been told it is mandatory.  In that context, I am seeking to spell out that possession or production of a public services card shall not be a mandatory requirement for the payment of a benefit.  Perhaps the Minister can reassure me of that in other ways but that is simply seeking to spell it out, even though I do not believe it should be necessary.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 sets out the requirement of a report which will set out and make clear the compatibility of all measures that will be put with the general data protection regulation.  I know there are bodies within Government and within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform working to implement GDPR but, given the kind of concerns I have highlighted today, I was targeting and looking for a specific report in respect of the public services card, SAFE 2 and the dataset gathered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  My condition here would be that the information gathered for the purpose of the public services card should not be shared and should be essentially for single use by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the initial function rather than being shared with the single customer dataset until we have those assurances.  When we have those assurances and proper procedures in place, so be it.  I am urging an approach which involves caution until we get it right, rather than ploughing ahead and then fixing it afterwards.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 3, there has been some ambiguity around the question of biometrics.  A photograph which can be biometrically read is biometric.  We have had different statements at different times from different parts of the Department around whether the photographs and cards are biometrics and whether we have had a proper debate on the use of biometrics.  The simple fact is that if there is a photograph and it can be biometrically read, it is effectively biometric.  If we are not ready to have the debate on biometrics, to discuss that properly and to look at the standards put in place, then for now, any photograph gathered for a public services card should not be shared, subjected to biometric reading or cross-checked against the database of biometric information.  I realise there may be imperfections in how this amendment is drafted and I am happy to work on it for Report Stage, if necessary.<\/p><p>My final amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 4, is the one I feel I need to press because it is urgent, unless there is any other way the Minister can indicate that clear direction can be given.  It states: \"A person shall produce his or her public service card or other appropriate form of identification at the request of a specified body for the purposes of a transaction.\"  Again, while I may look at amending this slightly and perfecting it, the key part of the amendment is: \"No specified body shall make possession of a public service card a mandatory requirement for the purposes of a transaction.&rdquo;  That is a key concern.  We have a situation where, at the moment, many of the demands for a public services card to be mandatory for specified bodies is based on a very shaky legislative basis, without proper consent having been given.  I am simply urging that the State would exercise appropriate caution until that is addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#P00500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I do not propose to accept any of the amendments which relate to the public services card and also to the general data protection regulation.  I would like first to make some points about the public services card.  When I get to the end of my contribution, the Senator might remind me about the fourth amendment, which is not included in this response, as I want to make a specific point about it.<\/p> <p>The main legal powers providing for and relating to the public services card and the SAFE registration process are set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.  They are as follows.  Sections 262 and 263B provide for the verification of identity to facilitate the issuing and use of a public services number, the PPS number or PPSN.  Sections 263, 263A and 263B provide for the verification of identity to facilitate the issuing, use and-or cancellation of a public services card.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 241 provides that a person must satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity when making a new claim and sets out how the person might go about doing that.<\/p><p>Section 247C provides that an existing claimant must satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity, sets out how that can be done and provides for disqualification where an existing claimant fails to so do.<\/p><p>The standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, registration process is used by my Department to establish and verify a person's identity in order that it can be sure that the person using its service is the person he or she claims to be, that nobody else is using that person's identity for the purpose of claiming a payment or service, that the person is not claiming another payment or using another service under a different identity and in addition, and to minimise the requirement for people to provide the same identity information repeatedly when accessing different services.<\/p><p>SAFE is a standard for establishing and verifying an individual's identity for the purpose of accessing public services and was agreed by the then Government in 2005.  The SAFE standard has four levels.  SAFE 0 is no assurance of identity, SAFE 1 is the balance of probabilities and the minimum authentication level for the allocation of a PPS number, SAFE 2 is a substantial assurance and the minimum authentication level for issuing a public services card, PSC, and SAFE 3 is beyond reasonable doubt, for example, if we were ever in a situation where fingerprinting, which is real biometric data, would be required.<\/p><p>My Department is implementing SAFE 2 registration on a phased basis with its customers and the customers of other public services that require identity verification to a substantial level of assurance.  Until recent times, many public services were provided to people who had their identities verified only to the SAFE 1 standard.  For example, identity documents such as passports and driver licences were issued following SAFE 1 equivalent registration processes.  Since the introduction of SAFE 2 registration in 2011, more services are moving to identity verification at this level to ensure a substantial assurance of someone's identity.<\/p><p>While it is a matter for each public service provider to determine the appropriate level of identity verification required for each of its services, it has been the policy of this Government and the previous two Governments that SAFE 2 registration is required for access to all services that require substantial proof of a person's identity.<\/p><p>My Department makes it clear to customers in receipt of welfare payments or entitlements that they need to register for the SAFE 2 verification process, in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions, to access or continue to access those payments and-or entitlements.  Once customers complete the SAFE 2 registration process, they may be issued with a PSC.  They may not be issued with one either, though, as customers do not have to have PSCs.  The PSC is replacing older documents used to show entitlement to a benefit, including the social welfare services card and, in some cases, the paper travel pass for free bus and rail travel.  Accordingly, it will in future be necessary to produce a PSC as proof of identity for certain types of transaction, including collecting welfare payments in cash at post offices and availing of free travel by old age pensioners and others who currently have the free travel pass.<\/p><p>The recently published Comprehensive Guide to SAFE Registration and the Public Services Card document is available on my Department's website.  Compiled as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner, it contains 54 detailed questions and answers that address a wide range of questions about SAFE registration and the PSC, including an explanation that, while the PSC stores a person's photograph, it does not store the arithmetic template of that photograph.  It also explains that the arithmetic template is not stored in the public service identity, PSI, dataset that we hold offsite, nor is it shared with other public bodies.  We can split hairs, but the Department does not hold biometric data.  They are only taken in the registration process.<\/p><p>Appendix 1 of the guide lists the legislative provisions associated with the PSC.  Appendix 2 contains the full list of specified bodies that may use PSI data under sections 260 to 265, inclusive, of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Primary legislation can be used to add new bodies to this Schedule should we ever feel the need to.<\/p><p>The general data protection regulation, GDPR, which will come into force on 25 May 2018, will replace the existing data protection framework under the EU data protection directive and impose a general necessity to have specific legislative provisions underpinning the methods that organisations such as mine use to process data.  The GDPR has significant implications for the way in which the public service does its business.  By using a regulation rather than a directive, the EU legislature aims to have a more uniform application of EU data protection law across member states than was the case under the previous EU data protection regulation.<\/p><p>The GDPR is complex legislation.  For example, it contains 173 recitals.  These are the preliminary paragraphs setting out the objectives and intentions of the EU legislation and guide interpretation, but they are not directly binding.  In addition, there are 99 articles, which are the operative provisions that are binding on EU member states.  Due to this high level of complexity and even though the EU legislature has opted for a regulation, there remains a need for national implementing legislation to give full effect to the regulation at national level.<\/p><p>The House is aware that my Department collects and holds large volumes of personal data on customers.  We are aware of the need to have adequate data protection policies, procedures and structures in place in line with the GDPR.  Preparations for the GDPR are being overseen by my Department's data management programme board, which comprises many of the Department's most senior personnel.  The Department has a dedicated GDPR implementation team in place and has commissioned external expertise to assist it with achieving GDPR compliance.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, has published the general scheme of the data protection Bill, and the Minister for Finance is working on a data sharing and governance Bill to simplify data sharing between public bodies.  Officials from my Department are examining both legislative measures in light of the GDPR and the relevant rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union.<\/p><p>There are strong frameworks and safeguards in place within the legislation governing the use of the PSC and the necessary steps are being taken to ensure compliance with the GDPR.  The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which is progressing through the D&aacute;il, includes a number of specific provisions relating to the PSC.  That Bill would offer a more appropriate vehicle for discussing the issues raised by the Senator, given that, when we return in the new year, our GDPR scheduling team will have advanced its preparations and we will be closer to the 18 May deadline.<\/p><p>Regarding the final amendment to which the Senator referred, there is no legal requirement to produce a PSC.  The card is a by-product of the SAFE 2 authentication process.  Therefore, the number obtained upon completing the registration process is what is vital for accessing other services, for example, SUSI.  It is not specifically the card that is the magic piece of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#Q00200","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I hate to interrupt-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#R00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Order, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#R00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I will speak later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#R00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Has the Minister finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#R00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will wrap up.

We should be very clear that under current legislation, the public services card cannot be used as a method to verify identification.  It is used specifically for the purposes of a transaction.  So there is a question, and there have been questions, as to whether or not some of the usages to which it has been put in terms of identity verification fit the constraints of the definition of a transaction.  It is not sufficient to have a PPS number.  I have sought to access a service and have been denied it, even though I have a PPS number but because I did not physically have a public services card.  That is an experience that many people will have had, even in terms of, for example, seeking a driver's licence.  One cannot get a driver's licence with another form of identification and one's PPS number.  One is required to have a public services card.

Energy poverty exists when people are unable to adequately heat their homes or meet other necessary household energy services at an affordable cost.  I said on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il that this amendment could not be accepted because it is not within my remit to look at the entire effects of energy policy, or lack thereof.  It would fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to do so.  My remit in this regard does not extend beyond income support.  With the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, we have extended the fuel allowance calendar by one week this year.  I hope, expect and anticipate that with continued support, we will be able to continue to increase that calendar as the years go by.<\/p> <p>In 2016, the Government launched a comprehensive strategy to combat energy poverty following extensive public consultation.  This strategy, which was developed in the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, builds on the progress and experience developed over the four years since the publication of the first Government strategy on affordable energy.  It expands the reach of existing energy-efficiency schemes and commits the Government to developing and piloting new measures to find more effective ways to focus energy efficiency efforts on those who are most at risk of energy poverty, as described by Senator Devine.  The strategy puts in place the structures and the accountability needed to ensure this challenge is effectively addressed at every level of the Government that has responsibility for addressing this issue.  The only responsibility that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has in this regard is to ensure the income support payments it makes so generously are provided to the people who need them.<\/p> <p>The fuel allowance scheme helps pensioners and other householders that depend on welfare to meet the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  It contributes towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It has never been anticipated that it should meet these costs in full.  Fuel allowance payments are made to more than 376,000 of the most disadvantaged householders in the country, including pensioners.  I agree with Senator Devine that pensioners are most at risk of energy poverty.  The amounts and duration of fuel allowance payments have been increased in recent years.  In 2016, the fuel allowance rate was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  In budget 2018, we increased the duration of this payment from 26 weeks to 27 weeks.  This was done with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  On foot of genuine requests from the advocacy agencies that look after people in this category, in the past year we have agreed to change the way this payment is made so that it can be received in two lump sums.  This option has been taken up and welcomed by tens of thousands of families.<\/p> <p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays the household benefits package at an estimated annual cost of &euro;232 million.  That is on top of the &euro;229 million annual cost of fuel allowance supports.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly or monthly supplement can be paid to help people who are unable to meet their weekly payments because of certain circumstances.  In many cases, this includes fuel supplement payments.  Average household energy costs vary from &euro;1,400 to &euro;2,200, with significant variation between urban and rural households.  The disparity between urban and rural households is largely based on the nature of the housing stock, because many houses in rural areas are much older and do not have the same energy ratings, and is one of the reasons for focusing on improving energy ratings through our local authorities.  The disparity between single and couple households is one of the main reasons for the payment of the living alone allowance of &euro;468 per year.<\/p> <p>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  As I have mentioned, a progressive and comprehensive cross-Government strategy on energy poverty is readily available and is currently being rolled out across various Departments.  I plan to increase the duration of the fuel allowance calendar in future budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#U00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I do not think it is rocket science to appreciate that research and reports tend to improve outcomes.

It was entirely based on the amount of credits that somebody had.  It was valued at &euro;850 and was usually paid to the person responsible for payment of funeral expenses.  The scheme was abolished in January 2014.  In 2013, the value of the scheme amounted to just over &euro;20 million.  It was given to people in the main who were not the most vulnerable people in society.  The social welfare assistance payment and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme were always available, even when the &euro;850 was being given to people who did not or could not necessarily afford to bury their loved ones.  These exception payments are made to the most vulnerable people in society.  The Government provided just over &euro;31.5 million in total expenditure for both of those payments last year.  There was an average payment of &euro;2,700 per family for bereavement and burial expenses.  The total expenditure was &euro;4.4 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is for those people who genuinely could not afford the expenses of burying a loved one.  In the intervening years, expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has remained broadly the same.  In 2014 it was &euro;4.6 million, and expenditure in 2015 and 2016 amounted to just over &euro;5 million.  The figure for 2017 will be &euro;5.2 million.  The average payment, as I said, is just under &euro;3,000.  I know it is something Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to look at in the budget but during our negotiations, the value of the contribution that would have to be given to every social insurance contributor was deemed to be more effectively spent with people who are genuinely vulnerable.  This led to an increase in the qualified child allowance, the extension of fuel allowance by a week and giving an increase of &euro;5 on <i>pro rata <\/i>pension payments to all old-age pensioners, blind pensioners, people with disabilities or an inability to work and people on partial capacity payments.  All of those people are genuinely vulnerable.  There is also the idea of maintaining the current practice within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection of looking after people with regard to burial and funeral costs when they are vulnerable and cannot afford to pay the expense themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#W00600","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513161000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I said we would call a vot&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#X00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I cannot reverse the procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#X00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I said we would press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#X00500","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>You did but we cannot go back to the amendment.

Care is the lifeblood of society and without it the economy and society would not function.  All too often it becomes somewhat invisible and it is not given the full acknowledgement that it should.  I have long pressed not only for the homemaker scheme to be addressed, as we have discussed before and will again today I am sure, but for a care credit and how we can move towards a modern social protection system recognising the contribution of care.  Mr. Peter Moss, who spoke on this matter before, said very eloquently that care always costs but the question is to whom the cost is levied.  Does it cost the time, energy and life of somebody contributing to care or does it cost the State?  Care is always a requirement.<\/p> <p>The question is how to better ensure the cost of care is managed.  We have had some progress with that in areas such as child care, for example.  I very much hope we will see progress in areas like home care and respite care, which give relief, so we can share the challenges and tasks involved with care, as they currently fall heavily on families.  This is all part of the picture of recognising the importance of care and seeing how we can better support and contribute to it.  There is also the question of payments and financial recognition of the needs and contribution of carers.  We could look to the carer support grant area.<\/p> <p>It is yet another gap in the pension system, unfortunately, as many of those who are carers fall out of the system.  If they have not been contributing or making PRSI contributions for a period before becoming carers, people will not necessarily have contributions made automatically on their behalf.  There is a gap, for example, with those who travel abroad and come home to become carers.  They fall through the system in different ways.  There are a number of scenarios in which people who give their time and life to care can sometimes fall through the system.  They can find themselves suffering great hardship when they are caring and penalised when they come to a point of retirement.<\/p> <p>There are a few matters to be looked at and this is a really good opportunity for that.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept or in some way accommodate us in looking more deeply at the question of care, as sought by Senator Ardagh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#X02400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Government and probably everybody in the country recognises and acknowledges the crucial role that family carers play in our society.  We are fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  The commitment is recognised in the national carers strategy.<\/p> <p>As the House may be aware, yesterday the Government agreed a new health service measure that will have a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities, particularly their carers.  Additional funding is being provided to enable all carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or a half carer's allowance to qualify for a GP visit card.  There will also be an additional &euro;10 million in funding to provide respite care for persons with disabilities.  That will provide an extra 1,900 bed nights over and above what was agreed in the budget for 2018.  The GP visit card measure will be implemented once the primary legislation is passed at the beginning of the new year.<\/p> <p>The crucial role that carers play is explicitly recognised within the social welfare system.  The income disregard and means test for carers is probably the most generous within the social welfare system and, at the full payment rate, the amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a people who are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The maximum personal weekly rate of carer's benefit is &euro;210, while the maximum personal weekly rate of carer's allowance stands at &euro;209 for those aged 66 years and under and &euro;247 for those aged over 66.  In the budget, with the support of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, we provided for an increase of &euro;5 per week from the week commencing 26 March 2018 in the maximum personal weekly rate of carer's benefit and carer's allowance.  We also maintained the non-means-tested respite carer's support grant of &euro;1,700 per annum.  Half of the carer's allowance is paid in addition to certain primary social welfare payments where the carer meets the criteria for both schemes.  Where a person is being claimed for as a qualified adult on his or her spouse, civil partner or co-habitant's social welfare payment and providing full-time care for another person, half-rate carer's allowance is paid, in addition to the qualified adult allowance.  Carers who provide care for more than one person may qualify for an additional 50% of the maximum rate each week.  Approximately 2,700 carers receive carer's benefit, while almost 75,000 receive carer's allowance.  Approximately half of the latter receive the reduced rate of carer's allowance, with another full social welfare payment.  In recognition of the value we place on the care provided, we will, as a nation, spend some &euro;728 million this year on carer's allowance and carer's benefit and &euro;180 million on the carer's respite grant and that is before we start to add the services provided by the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The adequacy of payments to carers, like every payment we make in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, is kept under constant review.  It is not the case that we need a special report or review to reflect the adequacy of the payments because it is done every year as part of the budgetary process and will be informed by developments in refreshing the national carers' strategy, for which my colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility.  Increases are entirely dependent on the recovering economy, of which we are all so proud.  I do not propose to accept the amendment and conduct a special once-off review because we carry out an annual review in the Department of all payments made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#X02500","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1513161000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 14; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Catherine Ardagh and Paul Daly; N\u00edl, Senators Gabrielle McFadden and John O'Mahony.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#Z00025","aye":["1407","1402","1408","1378","1383","1388","1396","1405","1417","1400","1395","1398","1413","1385"],"nay":["1409","1380","1423","1384","1422","1416","1424","1415","1386","1375","1374","1381","1426","1397","1421"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>There was an equality of votes.

In recent discussions at that committee, the sense has been that we might now be able to give a little bit of support to those seeking voluntary activation measures, be those in education, employment or training.  I regret the approach that was taken previously.  We have resources now, but many people who could have spent three-year, four-year or five-year periods of their lives engaged in training, education or employment were not supported.  We are discussing people's lives and opportunities.<\/p><p>The emphasis on those who face sanction and are being compelled to seek activation measures has sometimes caused us to neglect those who may be interested in voluntarily accessing supports but have concerns about the system.  For example, the system still requires full-time availability, which can act as a disincentive for those who may want to start building labour market attachment by working part-time because they have caring commitments or diminished capacity.<\/p><p>Rather than just having access \"in principle\", given that I have often been told that, in principle, there is access to Intreo and local employment services, I am calling on the Minister to ensure that there is effective access and support for those who are not on the live register but who wish to seek employment and activation measures, for example, people who are in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  They may wish to access employment and training opportunities prior to going on the jobseeker's transitional payment.  Lone parents have been mentioned.  There are many who would like to access supports and would not need to be pushed, but who would need to be supported.<\/p><p>Qualified adults are invisible in the social protection system.  In fact, not only are they distant from the jobs market, they are also distant from the social protection system and employment and activation supports.  In many cases, we do not chart who they are and what they might be interested in fully.  They can disappear from the register and the system.<\/p><p>The issue of people in receipt of the disability allowance requires a longer discussion.  Senator Dolan has engaged actively on this matter and may raise it on Report Stage.  Many high-quality schemes, for example, JobsPlus, are not available to people who are not on the live register.  One of the most striking and heart-breaking examples is the European Youth Guarantee.  When it was rolled out in Ballymun, a large number of lone parents were under the age threshold for the guarantee, but they were not allowed to access employment, training and education opportunities through the pilot scheme because the Youth Guarantee was targeted towards the live register.<\/p><p>These people have fallen by the wayside.  The Minister has an interest in this issue.  I will not speak so extensively on amendment No. 12 because it touches on similar issues, but amendment No. 9 suggests how to make access and support a reality for everyone who seeks them on a voluntary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#Z00100","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The focus of the employment services provided through Intreo is on supporting and assisting people who are returning to work in whatever shape happens to be appropriate for them.  Intreo services are already open to jobseekers - since our conversation last night, I have checked this - regardless of their status.  Many of the people we help are not on the live register.<\/p> <p>Local employment services provided by one of the contracted service providers have a similar focus on people who are not in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, including qualified adult dependants, who avail of these services on a voluntary basis.  However, it is acknowledged that many people have educational or training requirements that need to be met before they can successfully compete in the labour market.  In such cases, the staff of Intreo or local employment services will work with the individuals to identify and address those needs as part of the process of agreeing each individual personal progression plan and nominate the person for training within the education and training boards, ETBs, or other training providers, whichever is the person's wish.<\/p> <p>A range of activation programmes, particularly in the area of education and training, are available to any jobseeker irrespective of his or her live register status.  In line with long-established policy, participants on these programmes receive allowances in line with their previous welfare payments.  This means that persons who are not in receipt of welfare payments do not receive allowances, but we will engage reactively with them when they approach us for assistance.<\/p> <p>The funding model for wages on temporary employment programmes such as community employment and T&uacute;s is based specifically on the generation of savings as a result of participants moving off prior schemes and onto these schemes.  It is not feasible to alter this funding model for people who are not in receipt of social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>I will point the Senator towards two proactive measures.  To date, our Intreo services, local employment services and jobs clubs have worked reactively when people who are not on the live register approach them looking for assistance.  However, we are undertaking two projects this year.  We launched the Action Plan for Jobless Households and the Ability programme for people with disabilities.  Under these, our people will proactively seek out people who are in jobless households and not in receipt of social welfare payments within their own right.  Most of these are the qualified adults in question who receive payments through their spouses.  They will be targeted in an attempt to get them to engage with our training, education and work experience programmes.<\/p> <p>The Ability programme is designed to address these issues for people who have intellectual or physical disabilities.  We are working with NGOs and service providers to roll out a programme of specific actions and plans to make people who have disabilities job ready so that they can move to other social welfare payments, for example, the partial capacity payment, or part-time work, which is what we want them to do.  The purpose of our activation programmes is to get people unemployed or underemployed into full-time employment.<\/p> <p>I am not going to accept the amendment because there is no reason to do so, given that what the Senator is looking for is already the practice in our local offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#AA00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>While there may be access in principle, we are often not seeing effective access in practice.

Alternatively, they have been told that they are not a priority at this time or they have been given basic information in the form of leaflets and a website.  They have not been afforded case workers.  This is particularly so in terms of back to education measures and other programmes.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Minister's statement that she is now seeking to pursue active measures in terms of, for example, the pilot on jobless households.  A person's right to be supported through activation and employment measures is intrinsic and should not depend on the status of his or her partner or household.  However, I recognise this as a step forward and I hope that the lessons from the pilot scheme will lead to a further extension of supports.<\/p> <p>I wish to clarify something about the pilot scheme on jobless households.  When will we take lessons from that and determine how it might be strengthened or rolled out further?  Is participation on a voluntary basis?  There is a difference between encouragement and compulsion.  We want to be able to give people encouragement and support so that they feel like they can walk into Intreo or local employment service offices or whatever the case may be, but bringing them in with a fear of sanction or loss of payment is the way to go.

These guidelines are to include:<br \/><br \/>(a)a requirement that any individual in respect of whom a personal progression plan is being developed is presented with options in terms of education, training and employment;<br \/><br \/>(b)a requirement that any individual in respect of whom a personal progression plan is being developed be entitled to possession of a hard copy of any proposed personal progression plan prior to signing and be free to seek external advice on that proposed personal progression plan prior to signing;<br \/><br \/>(c)prohibition on any text requiring an individual to share data in respect of family members or cohabitees;<br \/><br \/>(d)prohibition of any text requiring an individual to share contact information, or permit contact, in respect of any employer who has offered that individual employment independently of the third party;<br \/><br \/>(e)recommendations to ensure compliance with General Data Protection Regulation.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to provide for guidelines in respect of personal progression plans and, in particular, how they are used by third parties contracted by the Department for the purposes of labour activation and not by the Department itself.  I am thinking of agencies such as Turas Nua and Seetec which have been contracted in respect of the JobPath programme.  There may be another way to ensure that the issues are addressed but the guidelines that I am proposing would touch on a number of issues of concern around how JobPath is operating on the ground and the requirements made of people in terms of personal progression plans.  <\/p><p>It is positive if people are given the opportunity to look forward and to develop a plan for their future.  However, it has been indicated that inappropriate language is contained in the personal progression plans which people are being required to sign in order to indicate that they are co-operating.  Like the Minister, I too believe that most people want to and will seize opportunities.  However, where people will not sign a particular piece of paper because they have legitimate concerns about the language in it and how it binds them, they are being regarded as not co-operating and, in effect, the activation and employment process does not proceed.<\/p><p>I want to highlight a number of key points.  It is important that a person is offered options.  This may be practice rather than policy or principle, but we have heard that people often feel they are not given full options in terms of education, training and employment.  In many cases, those who have engaged with JobPath have felt like they were strongly pushed towards a particular option and have not felt like they were able to consider it fully.  That is one concern.<\/p><p>We have heard of people being given a personal progression plan and asked to sign it before they are allowed to take a copy to seek advice, to discuss it or to compare it with others.  It is extremely poor practice that anyone would be asked to sign a contract before being given a copy of it to take away.  That is another key concern and I am seeking to address these issues because they are arising in practice.  There may be other ways to address them.  Perhaps they are not there in principle, but we need to give credence to what we hear from a number of sources.<\/p><p>Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) are linked.  This comes back to the general data protection regulation, which we discussed extensively in terms of the public services card, and people being inappropriately compelled to give information that is not necessary to the task at hand.  I have seen in at least one personal progression plan, and have heard that it may be standard, text that requires an individual to share data in respect of family members or co-habitees and to report any change in theirs or their spouse's circumstances.  While these issues may be discussed in terms of case work, these companies, if contracted simply to provide an activation and employment support for an individual, are not payment agencies.  We have often been reminded that they are not payment agencies, nor are they sanctioning agencies.  It would not seem appropriate that people would be required to give information about another individual with whom they may be living, for example, a spouse.  That person may have his or her own relationship with Intreo or may not be in the JobPath system. Therefore, there is a real concern about the requirement for that information to be given as a sign of co-operation.<\/p><p>Another concern is around text which requires people to agree to share contact information and permit contact with an employer they may have sourced outside and entirely separate to the third party.  If those in JobPath were to find a job on their own, perhaps a dream job or one with a small business, of course it is relevant that they would inform the Department that they are now in employment and no longer need jobseeker's allowance or benefit.  However, I cannot see how it is appropriate or necessary for them to inform Seetec or Turas Nua not only of the contact details of their new employer but to permit contact with that new employer.  They no longer require the services of these companies.<\/p><p>Deputy Murphy has highlighted in the D&aacute;il situations where Seetec and Turas Nua have contacted a new employer, which the person sourced himself or herself, and asked it to sign paperwork to indicate that the job was sourced through it when it was not.  We can only imagine how difficult and, in some cases, embarrassing it is for individuals to have their first week or two in new employment overshadowed by contact from a delegated third party company.  It is not the right way for anyone who had the initiative to find a job to begin his or her new employment.<\/p><p>Will the Minister address those concerns?

I cannot state in more strenuous terms that it is not a contract or a legally binding document.  It is a progression plan for someone who is out of work to get him or her into work.  It is as simple as that.  The Senator, as have others, has referred to them but these plans are not unique to Turas Nua or Seetec.  These companies happen to be two agents operating for us around the country, but the same personal progression plans are developed for those availing of our Intreo services.  If there is a criticism, it cannot be confined to Seetec or Turas Nua.  There are as many personal progression plans availed of through our Intreo offices as there are elsewhere.<\/p> <p>The plan is developed in consultation between the jobseeker and the adviser, whether that is an Intreo adviser or an agency adviser.  It is a supporting and enabling document which is meant to map out the person's journey towards upskilling, getting rid of barriers to employment a person might face and finding pathways to a job.  The jobseeker is getting one-on-one treatment weekly from an adviser, which is what the provision of activation support is all about.  It is about working closely with people to ensure that we get the best results for the individual given his or her current circumstances.<\/p> <p>The laying down of such prescriptive and restrictive guidelines as the Senator suggests in her amendment would be contrary to the engagement between the personal adviser and the jobseeker, which is policy.  Further, it might get in the way of what is supposed to be a genuine and mutually developing relationship between the two people over a period of time, which can be up to 12 months if the person is engaging with the adviser.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important to note that at the time of their making the claim to be a jobseeker, whether it is in an Intreo office, a local DSP office or having been sent onwards to Seetec and Turas Nua, through an agreed record of mutual commitments, we are already aware of all of the information the Senator is concerned people might be being compelled to give.  In order to make a jobseeker's claim, we already know who one is living with, how many dependents one has at home and what one's circumstances are.  That information has already been shared.  The only reason - because there is no requirement at a personal progression plan stage to share that one has three children and one's granny is living in the house with him or her - that those conversations should take place is because a person's circumstances at home may form a barrier to employment or to progressing a pathway to work.  It is only from general concern and in conversation with each other that we might inquire how old one's children are, does one have a dependent spouse at home or whether one's elderly relative is living there.  It is a general conversation of sharing of data that we already have in what I will call, for argument's sake, HQ.<\/p><p>To be clear and straight with the Senator, if a person does not want to share that information with his or her personal adviser, then the person need not do so.  There is no part of the personal progression plan that says a person cannot move to part B if he or she does not share certain information.  It does not exist.  From an adviser's perspective, this is generally only part of developing the relationship to learn what are the barriers to jobseekers achieving full employment.<\/p><p>A key element of the modern activation service, obviously, from our perspective, is to secure full employment or fuller employment for those who are in part-time work.  The personal advisers' sole job is to be the jobseekers' conduit from not having work to getting work.  I stressed this to the Senator last night.  There are now two reasons.  If a person has initiative enough to get jobs outside of that personal progression plan that he or she might have with the adviser, first, we want to know who the employer is, but not with a view to contact with the employer.  There is a mistaken view out there that unless we know who the employer is, Turas Nua and Seetec do not get paid for the placement.  They get paid anyway.  They get paid if we do not know who the employer is.  They get paid once somebody who is on JobPath gets a job.  If that job happens to be in Outer Mongolia or up in Superquinn in Finglas, they get paid anyway.  The reason that there is the continuation of the co-operation is that the advisers provide ongoing in-work support because sometimes - this is borne out by practice - people have developed strong personal relationships.  In many cases, when somebody gets a new job, it is after having been out of work for a long time.  His or her confidence might not be as high as one would like it to be.  He or she is probably vulnerable and nervous.  We provide those in-work supports to ensure that the person knows that his or her adviser is there at the end of a phone, but also once a month the adviser will touch base with the person to ask how is it going, whether there is any difficulty and whether has the person settled in and made new friends.  It is what one would expect for two people who have developed a relationship over a period up to 12 months.<\/p><p>I emphasise to the House that my Department's public employment services, including Turas Nua, Seetec and our own Intreo offices, operate in full compliance with the data protection legislation.  All of our contractors are aware of their current obligations under the GDPR.  Obviously, as we change, as we suggested earlier on, when the new regulations come into play on 18 May next year, all of our contractors will have been given strict new guidelines that they will have to adhere to on the basis of the new directive coming into play then.  I hope the Senator is reassured.  Because of that, it would be unfair of me to put such prescriptive restrictions that definitely should not apply to the policy or the practice that is carried on on our behalf by any of our agents, but also because our Intreo offices do the same thing.  It would be too prohibitive to put them in as amendments to the legislation.<\/p><p>I listened carefully to what Senator Higgins said about anecdotal evidence on Second Stage.  Much anecdotal evidence that is brought; some of it may be grounded in truth and some of it is not.  If the Senator genuinely has somebody who has the experience which she stated on Second Stage, I ask her to bring the information either to me or to somebody in the Department and I promise we will follow up on it.  If the policy is different from the practice, I want to know about it and ensure that all of our practices adhere to the policy commitments that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#BB00500","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is a little different because they are only contracted for part of the process whereas the question of payment and sanction still sits with what the Minister described as \"HQ\".  That is why the question of what information is appropriate to be shared with a third party who is not contracted in terms of payment or sanction arises and why I was calling for additional scrutiny in that regard.

I go and meet these people so that I can be categorically satisfied when I stand in front of the Seanad and state that I see good stuff happening.  With tens of thousands of people, one will always have somebody who does not have a pleasant experience.  It might be a personality.  We have to deal with those on a case by case basis.  However, in the main, we are providing real opportunity and progression for those who are going through JobPath.  I witnessed a young fella giving his adviser a Christmas present wrapped up - a poinsettia and a box of chocolates - the other day.

People may well be seeking full-time employment.  However, if they are offered a two hour job, for example, between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for five days a week, they face the danger that by simply taking the job they will be marked as being fully employed.  Again, my query concerns the notion of full-time availability.  The provision does not exclusively affect women but persons who have caring responsibilities.  If such people get a full-time job they may be able to afford child care.  If they accept a part-time job that involves a small number of hours worked across a few days then carers can find themselves falling into a trap and in a bind.  Part-time work can close off opportunities to build labour market attachments, working relationships, etc.  My amendment seeks to address the question of hours versus days and seeks to ensure we support people in a more effective manner in availing of part-time on their way to full-time work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#DD00100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>We recognise that the labour market is changing.

There is a whole new way of working that we never had before and the job activation schemes must reflect same.<\/p> <p>There are two reasons I do not want to apply this provision, specifically on its own.  I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment because there is an amendment that calls on me to review the working family payment system.  I would like, in totality, to consider how we can best merge the hours-based system and the working family payment system.  If I consider the hours system on its own, then we will end up right back at zero.  The introduction of changes to the current criteria for calculating entitlement to the jobseekers allowance, as in moving to an hours-based system, will result in a significant number of individuals becoming eligible for jobseekers payment thus costing tens of millions of euro.  Conversely, it is important to note that if an hours-based system was introduced existing casual jobseekers will lose out on payments that they currently receive from my Department, which might save us tens of millions of euro.  While we might help people in one area we will hinder people in another area.  We never want to do something good that will cause an anomaly and, therefore, I ask the Senator to allow me, in the review of the working family payment scheme, to consider how best to move forward.  I know that the Senator does not want to hinder anyone.  I know she wants to help people who can only work for a small number of hours but cannot live on fresh air for the rest of the hours that they are unavailable for work.  In the review, I will consider ways to address the issue the Senator has specifically sought to address.  Maybe one of the solutions will be to widen some of the working family payments.  Let us consider the current stipulation for 15 or 19 hours in the review.  I will bring the findings back to the joint committee where we can discuss the results and consider how best to prepare.  If we are going to do something about this matter, it can only be done during the budgetary process next year that we will start after the summer, or maybe before the summer depending on our workload.

There was some overlap so I will not reiterate my key points.  Amendment No. 12 refers to the question of qualified adults.  My amendment seeks the issue to be re-examined and in a wider context than jobless families.  There is another little group involved.  For example, a person may be retired and he or she may have a qualified adult spouse who may be younger in age.  There are a few cohorts involved.  I appreciate that the Minister plans to examine these aspects as part of the pilot programme and I hope these issues will be teased out.  I specifically wonder whether lessons can be learned from the jobseekers' transitional payment, which is in the process of improvement, in terms of targeted casework.  I urge that consideration be given to child care supports and other supports that a qualified adult might need in order to access job activation opportunities.  I also have questions about job readiness and upskilling, including in cases where a person wants to return to education so that the person is education ready as well as employment ready.  I suggest that such matters be considered.<\/p><p>I know I sound like a broken record but I want something positive done about the jobseekers transitional payment.  Consideration must be given to the requirement to be available for full-time employment.  The waiving of that requirement for the jobseekers transitional payment was a positive move because it gave people the freedom to talk about options, and to do so honestly.  I hope that such jobseekers will get the opportunity to talk about it with caseworkers but that is not what I sought with my previous amendment.

She has already been in discussions with the Minister.  My amendment refers to a national maintenance body.  As the Minister will be aware, the joint committee put forward a very strong recommendation in its report on the Position of Lone Parents in Ireland published earlier this year.  We very strongly suggested that we need to consider the option of a national maintenance body and highlighted the flaws.  I know the Minister and others, on separate occasions, talked about the flaws whereby we have practices that are inappropriate for women, although it is not always women who must pursue their spouses for maintenance payments to support their children.  Such people also fear that they may lose payments or get reduced ones if they are not seen to be actively seeking a maintenance payment.<\/p><p>A few years ago there was an unfortunate moment in the history of the Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection when it issued a letter informing a number of spouses that they would no longer be watching to see if maintenance payments were made.  I refer to the time the jobseekers transitional payment was introduced and there was a move away from the one-parent family payment.  The letter was framed in an unfortunate manner because it sent a negative signal about maintenance.  Historical mistakes have been made and the current practices do not work.  I will not enumerate them in great detail because I know it is an issue of great interest for my colleague, Senator Ruane, who is attending a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.

I will first speak about amendment No. 15, which is on jobseekers transitional payment.  One of my key concerns is that those who have a child over 14 years of age cannot access the jobseekers transitional payment and, therefore, are not part of the jobseekers transitional payment supports.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice Mary-Higgins:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will speak first to amendment No. 15 and then to amendment No. 14, as it will work better.  <\/p><p>I spoke previously about the jobseeker's transitional payments supports.  There are still concerns.  I know that there has been a partial income disregard restored in terms of the financial loss that people experienced in moving to the jobseeker's transitional payment.  I want to focus on the supports attached to jobseeker's transitional payments.  There is a concern, which comes back to the issue of casework, about whether a full and rich gamut of employment, training and educational opportunities are being offered to those who are on the jobseeker's transitional payment.<\/p><p>As a result of the waiver on the requirement for full-time availability, we still do not have an adequate or wide enough range of part-time courses, part-time training supports or part-time education.  People may want to go back to education but they would only be able to go part time.  How can we ensure that when people are on this new payment they will also have an appropriately tailored set of supports, for example, those which recognise the constrained time availability but also access to the full range of the wider supports that are there?  The Minister addressed this very eloquently on Second Stage that there is no reason that a lone parent who is on the jobseeker's transitional payment may not want to start a five-year course to become a physicist and why that should not be one of the options on the table, rather than being bound into a constrained set of options.  It is around improving that work.<\/p><p>The problem of lone parents with a child more than 14 years of age, is that they do not have access to any of the tailored supports, the idea of case workers who would be working with them, recognising in particular their care balances and in some cases a person is available full-time but in other cases, parents of a 14 or 15 year old who are facing challenges may not feel they are able to work full-time because they are parenting alone.  They do not have a safety net or back-up person who is sharing holiday time and whatever else families do to try to manage.<\/p><p>We all know that every family in Ireland, not just lone parent families, are juggling and figuring out how to make it work.  The challenges faced by a lone parent with teenagers are very high.  There are two concerns.  First, the qualified child payment.  I recognise there was a small increase in that payment.  I am sure the Minister would acknowledge that the small increase in the qualified child payment was inadequate.  There is a specific need for an increase in qualified child payments for those with children over the age of 14 years.  We know that in great detail from the Vincentian Partnership indepth research on minimum essential standards of living.  We know there are huge costs.  The other issue is the additional child care supports and tailored options that people might need.  I hope, I will revisit it in the year ahead, that we should be able to look to a point where anybody with a child under 18 years who is parenting alone is able to access jobseeker's transitional support.<\/p><p>People who are parenting alone feel they become invisible parents once their child hits 14 years of age.  The lone parent feels he or she is viewed as just a person claiming the jobseeker's allowance, and is no longer recognised as somebody who is parenting alone and facing those particular challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#DD01900","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 14 addresses the qualified child increases, QCI.  I totally recognise not just what Senator Higgins said, but what NGOs have said, that it costs more money to raise teenagers.  I have a few of them at home.  We know that they go round with their hands out all of the time and that they grow out of clothes more quickly.  I do not need to be told that.<\/p> <p>I would have loved to have been able to reflect and recognise that this year, but because of the way the budget negotiations were structured and the numbers we had to consider, there was not a significant sum left over to implement specific policy measures.  The qualified child increase of &euro;2 this year was the first increase in eight years.  That is not enough, but had I reflected the over 12 years, and under 12 years, I would have ended up giving &euro;3 to one and &euro;1 to other.  I thought the money was so miserable in the first place.  That is not to say that I do not recognise the point that the Senator has made.  I do recognise it and in next year's budget and budgets thereafter, we will reflect the reality that having teenagers does cost more money.  I can only give my word on amendment No. 14, as opposed to tabling an amendment.<\/p> <p>A number of services are available to people on the jobseeker's transition payments.  We need to reflect on when we brought it in, that some of the people we did not get to might have children over 14 years of age and they would have gone on to jobseeker's allowance or benefit before they got to avail of the full range of services that were specifically designed for lone parents with children aged between seven and 14 years to upskill and educate themselves.  I will ensure we carry out an analysis to make sure that if people have gone to the next level and did not avail of the services, that we proactively go after them.<\/p> <p>We will proactively ensure that we reach all of the 32,000 lone parents who are under the jobseeker's transitional umbrella.  We have only reached 60% of them to date and we will ensure that we get to the remainder before they transition to the next jobseeker's allowance.  Just because somebody goes on to jobseeker's allowance, does not mean that we should treat him or her differently.  We still should recognise the limitations that they have and the concerns of care.<\/p> <p>There are many more children that present with difficulties over and above the number who would have presented ten to 30 years ago.  We need to recognise the barriers to work.  That comes back to the personal progression plan that people have with the staff in our Intreo offices or our agents.  If we are not fully aware of the barriers that exist in people's lives then we cannot plan around how to help them to become job ready and to become employed.  I am absolutely adamant that there should be no limits to women or men who are parenting alone who want to upskill or educate themselves.  The idea of only having 20 courses that one can go on and the rest of the world is closed off is not acceptable to me.  I will come back to this Chamber in the next couple of weeks with a complete list of what is available both through e-learning or through our education courses.  If we do not like the look of it, then we will change it.

I have some concerns.  Yesterday in this House we heard about the move to the new supplementary pension system, about which the Minister has spoken previously.  I refer to the new auto-enrolment pension system.  The concern is that we have also been hearing that the total contribution approach is going to be brought in by 2020.  We have heard that the total contribution approach had the potential to address some of the concerns about our unfair averaging system.  That said, I recognise that there are still concerns, namely, recognition of care and how best to operate a care credit, which the total contribution approach would need to factor in.  In other words, how do we include and reflect care in the total contribution approach?  I would also note that in the auto-enrolment system, how we recognise and support care is also going to be an issue, if we are to ensure that we do not have yet another gender pension gap in that system further down the line.<\/p> <p>My concern is this.  As we move towards the new auto-enrolment system, what is happening around the move to the total contribution approach?  If we are not going to deliver that by 2020, or even if we are, we still must do something to address the basic inequality in our averaging system.  It is an inequality on an inequality.  The first of these is the inequality caused by women being pushed out by the marriage bar.  As I said yesterday, I believe that in 1973, when we were told that the marriage bar was not acceptable, we should have put pensions systems in place to address the impact it had had since it had been noted as being inequitable.  We did not do this. <\/p> <p>On top of the first insult arising from issues like the marriage bar, there is the ongoing tendency to deeply penalise anybody who takes a period out for caring.  That occurs even if they have made the same amount of contributions as somebody else over their lifetime.  It is an unacceptable inequality and it is not something we can stand over, especially as a Government that has committed to gender and equality proofing our budget.  <\/p> <p>This is why it sits with the Minister, but it also sits with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I have highlighted this.  That Department is responsible for the implementation of the legislation for public duty around equality and human rights proofing.  It is also fundamentally responsible for the gender and equality proofing of our budget every year.  I cannot see how this stands up.  I do not know how it slipped through another year.  It is like a glaring black mark on any future report we produce on equality.<\/p> <p>In that regard, I suggest that the solution to this anomaly should not simply be sought using the resources allocated to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, because the solution will need a wider scope.  I have discussed this before with the Minister.  We spend &euro;2.6 billion on private pension tax relief in this country.  In many cases I am sure it is important and it has many merits.  When we debated this during the Finance Bill 2017, many people spoke about the various merits and the encouragement it provides.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of problems with how it is done.<\/p> <p>There is another inequality, and it seems inequalities are piling up, namely, we award private pension tax relief at a marginal rate.  As such, many in the country who are on a low income have the not very incentivising tax relief of 20%, whereas those who are looking to be on higher incomes have a much more incentivising 40%.  When this was discussed before, what I sought from the Department was something that was in fact recommended in the memorandum of understanding with the troika, namely, that we should move to a standard rate of perhaps 30%, which every citizen seeking a pension and a private pension could access.  This would deliver adequate savings, I hope, to at least partially address the gaps that we have seen here.  I ask that we consider addressing an inequality so that we can address an inequality.  That is what I am putting forward as a proposal.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#FF00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I might be able to tick all of those boxes.  The reason I think these measures got through the gender proofing test is that it does not just affect women.  I know it affects more women than men, but only marginally.  Those affected are 60% women and 40% men, so we are nearly equally discriminatory to both sexes.  That still does not make it all right.<\/p><p>Let us talk about the three different things Senator Higgins brought up.  The first of these was the pensions anomaly whereby the averaging system penalised people because they started work very early, stopped to care for their families and then came back to work again.  I have a report with some recommendations that will go to the Cabinet economic committee on 18 January 2018.  Assuming that we agree at that table, it will then go to the full Cabinet committee the following week.  As soon as it goes to Cabinet I will issue the report, because hopefully I will have agreement from my Cabinet colleagues on how to fix the anomaly and a roadmap of how to get there, starting in the following couple of months.  That sets out when I am going to deal with the anomaly if not yet how.  When I release the report the Senator will know how I am going to deal with it.  Senator Higgins is right to say that the money cannot come from the current budget, because I do not have it.  It is not small change.  There are 42,000 people currently affected by it today, and rectifying this will cost the taxpayer money.<\/p><p>Moving to other topics, I will answer Senator Higgins's first amendment by saying that the Government is not going to extend the homemaker's scheme.  I do not wish to be so brutal as to say &quot;No&quot; to the Senator.  However, we propose to calculate pensions in the future by abolishing the averaging system.  When we move to the total contribution approach on 1 January 2020, the averaging system will be gone and the length of time a claimant has worked will be irrelevant.  The number of contributions needed to get into each band will be agreed through the public consultations that I will launch after Christmas, and there will be a sizeable carer's credit.  That credit will be irrespective of whether claimants are minding their children or their older parents.  It is not prescriptive.  It will be as a result of the public consultation, but we will put out examples of what we think might work, and depending on the responses that we get from both industry and individuals, that will determine what the final model looks like.  I hope to have an agreement between the middle and the end of next year on what the total contribution model will look like.  Then we can begin creating an IT platform to be able to manage it, to collect and to pay, with a view to going live on 1 January 2020.<\/p><p>The second point is separate and distinct, but it reflects on subsection (e) of the proposed amendment.  Senator Higgins is well aware that at the moment we give &euro;2.6 billion worth of tax relief to people on both the 20% and the 40% bracket.  That is unfair.  The people who were earning more money get more tax relief than the people who were earning less money.  The new model that we are introducing, which will also undergo public consultation after Christmas, is the auto-enrolment model.  I would like to put it on the record that yesterday's front-page story in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, along with what was written by the young journalist on pages 13 and 14, is entirely inaccurate.  She got her information from a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, which does not reflect the ambitions of the Department.  I repeat, what will be subject to public consultation in January will not be a finished product.  The finished product will be informed by the responses of members of the public on what they want to see.  I have said it on the record before, and I will say it again here in this House.  Whatever system we conform to at the end of that couple of months of public consultation will be entirely fair to everybody.  People will not get more tax relief on the new auto-enrolment scheme because they happened to earn more money than others getting less tax relief.<\/p><p>Within a proposed salary bracket of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;60,000 - those figures are purely for the purposes of this discussion - if a claimant puts in &euro;5, his or her employer will put in &euro;5 and the State might put in &euro;2.50.  I emphasise that those figures are plucked from the sky.  The actual figures will be determined by industry collaborating with us and individuals making suggestions of what they think they can afford.  The misleading and entirely inaccurate story on the front of the newspaper yesterday, which said that people would have to put &euro;200 of their wages into pension schemes every week or month, is wrong.  It sets a very misleading tone for what should be a very exciting reform of pensions and tax relief, and a way for young people to save extra money over and above what they would normally get from either the non-contributing pension or the contributing pension when they reach 66 or 67.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of what the Senator has asked for, except the homemaker's credit, is going to be provided for in the anomaly provision on 18 January, the total contributions public consultation and the auto-enrolment public consultation.

The averaging system that affected people in that, while I will not call it unfair, made people not get as much money as they should have expected to get, will be entirely gone out of the new total contributions system.  The exact parameters of that will be determined and arrived at from the public consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#FF00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I am also glad to hear in regard to the auto-enrolment model that the Minister is looking at a three-part contribution from employees, employers and, of course, the State.  That three-part element, whatever way it may finally be constructed, is an important principle.<\/p> <p>In recognition of the fact the Minister is moving forward and that we will be looking extensively at this area of pensions, I will not be pressing this amendment at this point.  However, I would note that, nonetheless, despite these wonderful visions for the future, we have a cohort in Ireland who are deeply disadvantaged and we cannot simply wait for them to move on up to 2020.  There is a cohort of people who are suffering inequality every single time they go to get their pension and, on a weekly basis, they are feeling the impact of that inequity.  In some cases, it is those who have this as a very small independent income and who may not be able to apply for the non-contributory pension, for example, because of their partner's means or other forms of means but for whom, individually, their pension represents the message the State sends to them about how their contribution over their lifetime has been valued.<\/p> <p>I will be continuing to press in respect of the homemaker's credit.  This applies to older women and men across Ireland.  The Minister is right that there are men, particularly those who worked and travelled, for example, in England, for years and then returned, and who are disadvantaged by this averaging system.  I know they will continue to campaign.  One of the strongest signals the State can send in order to build confidence in the new auto-enrolment and total contributions systems - while it would be costly financially, it would be important symbolically - would be to send the signal that we have addressed a past inequity.

On behalf of the Labour Party group, I am delighted to propose this motion in defence of the employment rights of special needs assistants.  Before I do so, I want to acknowledge the attendance in the Visitors' Gallery of members of IMPACT and some of the special needs assistants it represents very ably and with distinction.  It might not be well known to many Members of this House - in fact, it might not be well known to many members of the Irish public in general - that IMPACT has balloted for industrial action out of complete frustration with the actions, or inaction, of the Department of Education and Skills.  Most people would agree that when a profession such as that of special needs assistants is forced to ballot for industrial action, something has gone seriously wrong.  SNAs are dedicated to the welfare of the students they work with.  Anyone who has ever come across an SNA in any school in Ireland knows that this is their primary concern.  When it comes to a situation where the union that represents over 8,000 SNAs feels it has to ballot for industrial action, and when 97% of those SNAs agree that industrial action is the route they feel it is necessary to pursue, then something is seriously wrong.<\/p><p>I have some history with this issue, as do many in the Labour Party.  I initiated an Oireachtas committee report on the role of the SNA in the last Oireachtas and this was completed by the then Senator Mary Moran and published in January 2016.  I recall a number of years ago having a public meeting in my constituency on the issue and that meeting was stuffed out the door with people willing to tell their stories.  What always comes back, and it happened again this afternoon at our briefing for all Members of the Oireachtas, whom I want to thank for attending to hear the story of SNAs, is that it is never, ever about money.  Fundamentally, what SNAs are asking for is respect.<\/p><p>We could spend hours talking about the respect or disrespect that SNAs get within the walls of the schools in which they work.  Any SNA will tell stories they have heard or witnessed about menial tasks they have been asked to undertake, about the fact they are referred to by their first name while every other adult in the school is referred to by their second name and about the basic lack of value placed upon them as professionals in an educational setting.  However, we are not here to talk about that.  We are also not here to talk about the number of SNAs in the system, which obviously was increased under the last Government and again under this Government.  While that is to be welcomed, it is not the point.  The point is the way that SNAs are treated by the Department of Education and Skills.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Fundamentally, it comes down to the timing of the allocations.  I know last week and earlier this month, it was relayed to IMPACT that that situation would change and that the allocations would be known from May next year so that SNAs can plan for September in future.  That is to be welcomed but it is very late in the game for SNAs to know that and it is disappointing that they had to ballot for industrial action before they got such clarification from the Minister's Department.  There is still a huge number of issues with the situation with special needs assistants.  The Minister mentioned in his counter-motion that a review is being undertaken by the National Council for Special Education relating to the role of an SNA.  IMPACT informed us this afternoon that it has no role, involvement or engagement in that review.  It is staggering that, if the Department is to pretend that the SNA is respected, the body that represents the vast bulk of SNAs has no involvement in this review.  The Minister can suggest to me that that is not the case.  If it is not the case, why would senior members of IMPACT state it so categorically in an open forum this afternoon?<\/p><p>Points were raised this afternoon which really shocked me and I thought I knew this issue inside-out.  The issues include SNAs at second level being asked to be on-site doing fundamentally menial tasks in June.  Gardening and painting were mentioned.  Just being asked to be on-site for the month of June was mentioned.  That is something that anybody would find reprehensible from an employment rights perspective.  They have no board of management representation.  Everybody else in an educational setting has representation on the board of management.  The parents and patron would have representation on the board of management but not the special needs assistants.  They have no involvement with the care plan for individual students.  When a care plan is put together by the school for the students who are under the care of an SNA assigned to help them during the day, the SNA is not involved in that care plan.  It comes back again and again to the issue of respect.<\/p><p>I know the Minister will not want to micromanage every school and the way every school or school principal deals with an SNA or group of SNAs in the school but leadership in education comes from the top.  I suggest that leadership at the moment is sorely lacking.  Another issue, which it might be suggested is small, that comes down to basic respect is the matter of bereavement leave.  If one is a teacher, bereavement leave is five days whereas it is three days for an SNA.  All these small things add up to SNAs believing that they are not respected, do not have security of work and cannot plan for the future or look forward to September with some kind of security of tenure.  Until now, SNAs have not known if they would be back in a school in September; they wondered if they should apply for another job and considered that perhaps they should not because they might retain original positions.  There is insecurity related to bills, mortgage repayments etc. that everyone has to pay.<\/p><p>We ask the Minister to change the attitude that the Department has to special needs assistants, to acknowledge them as a vital component of our educational system, to acknowledge that the special needs assistants we have, approaching 14,000, are vital in the roles that they have.  They are not an add-on to the system.  They are not a luxury.  They need to be clearly defined.  They need to be given the respect and value that they deserve at this stage.  It is only fitting that the report compiled by former Senator Mary Moran would be at the top of any review mechanism that is in place.  <\/p><p>We have a few fundamental questions.  I know it is the way of things to put down a counter-motion and that the Minister has spoken in his counter-motion about the number of SNAs who have been allocated and that is fine and to be welcomed.  However, the employment rights and the value placed on individual SNAs is what we are speaking about today.  It does not come down to the salary expectation that any SNA has.  Whenever I or any of my Labour colleagues ever have a discussion with special needs assistants, money is never raised.  It is always about the respect they are given from within the school and from the Department.  We ask the Minister to expand on what he has said in his counter-motion with regard to the review.  Will he engage with the practitioners and representatives in compiling that review?  I find it incredibly frustrating when dealing with the Department that there always seems to be a review, committee or paper written by somebody else and the Department seems unwilling or unable to make a definite decision outside of having another body compile a report.<\/p><p>There are many issues in the area of education that we in the Labour group feel the Government is falling down on.  We have the ongoing issue of pay discrimination among primary and second level teachers which was raised again with me today.  Noises from Government are not helping with it.  I got a phone call today from Councillor Mark Wall in Kildare about St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin and its lack of certainty as to the progress of its school building.  There are many issues with education coming down the tracks.  We get action plan after action plan after action plan from the Department yet the very good work which was compiled by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills seems to have been sitting on a shelf for almost two years.  There is inaction when it comes to a cross-party, bipartisan approach to the future of the SNA.  Let us get beyond the numbers of SNAs allocated by the Minister's Department because that has been acknowledged.  We want to deal with the issue of respect, ensure we value special needs assistants and engage with them and their representatives in any review the Minister undertakes.  We will call a vote on our motion.  We are sticking with it as laid down.  We reject the counter-motion and we want support for our motion from all corners of this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#GG01200","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I second the motion.  I reiterate that we are not supporting the Government counter-motion, if that needs to be emphasised.  I commend my colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, on moving this motion on behalf of Labour Senators.  It arises from his own long experience as a teacher and principal and seeing first-hand the important role of SNAs.  From my own experience as a parent of a primary school child, I know the invaluable contribution made by SNAs to supporting the work of schools.  In many classrooms across the country, as the Minister is aware, SNAs increasingly form a vital part of the school and educational infrastructure.  I thank Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for facilitating a briefing earlier today with IMPACT representing SNAs and I welcome our colleagues from IMPACT and those representing SNAs who are in the Public Gallery for this debate.  We are disappointed that the Government has tabled a counter-motion.  We believe that the wording of our own motion is sensible, reasonable and reflects the real concerns and views of SNAs.<\/p> <p>I reiterate what we heard from Kevin Callinan and others at the IMPACT briefing earlier.  As Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has said, this motion and the principles behind it are not about money or the pay of SNAs.  They are about respect for SNAs and the treatment, conditions and employment rights of SNAs, particularly their desire and absolute entitlement to be treated with respect in the workplace, which the wording of our motion reflects.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In particular, our motion seeks to emphasise the major problems that delayed publication of special needs assistants, SNAs, allocations causes to individual SNAs and schools, which must plan for the years ahead.  In particular, this year the IMPACT ballot spoken of by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was prompted by the delayed publication of SNA allocations to July, just two months before the new term for the 2017 and 2018 school year started.  This caused enormous uncertainty for thousands of SNAs around the country who simply did not know until the last minute whether they had a job to return to in September.  Not only is this disrespectful to SNAs but it is disrespectful to the schools, parents and, most important, the children whose education depends on the SNA allocation.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly address some of the broader points our motion also reflects, particularly the importance of SNAs in ensuring our children achieve full potential in schools.  Many of us were very disturbed by comments made around the budget this year, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, quoted being critical of the rise in the numbers of SNAs.  He said he was alarmed by rapidly escalating costs while referring to the fact there are more SNAs than garda&iacute;.  This language was heavily criticised by Ms Lorraine Dempsey of the Special Needs Parents Association, who said she was concerned about the dangerous use of language.  One can consider some of the commentary of the time.  An editorial in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>pointed out that there has been an incidence of SNA allocations increasing but this is due to rising child populations, medical advances, better diagnoses and better recognition of the rights of children to be schooled in a mainstream educational setting.  After years of playing catch-up, we are finally making progress in meeting the needs of some of our most vulnerable children.  The incidence of special needs diagnoses is increasing and so are the numbers of children who previously would not have been in mainstream schools.  For example, there are 700 more children with special needs entering third level now versus two years ago, up 31%.  We are seeing dramatically improved outcomes for children and young adults as a result of SNA allocations.  Children are being enabled for the first time in our education system to meet their full potential.<br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also spoke of recent announcements by the Minister last week that we very much welcome.  That happened after we submitted the text of the motion, if I am correct.  We very much welcome the Minister's announcement, as reported on 6 December, that a total of 130 additional special needs assistants would be made available for allocation to schools between January and June 2018 and that schools would be informed of their allocation for the 2018-2019 school year much earlier, possibly May rather than late summer.  The announcement was welcomed by the Special Needs Parents Association and we also welcome it, as will the SNAs and IMPACT.  It is still not good enough that we have waited until what seems the last minute before we debate this motion for the announcement to be made.  In 2016, the Oireachtas education committee, as Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in noted, specifically recommended that allocations be made earlier, ideally in March or April of the year preceding the year in which they are to be allocated.<br\/><br\/>We are disappointed with the amendment.  We recognise the advances and increases, as well as the fact there will be more than 14,000 special needs assistants in place as a result of the recent announcement.  We very much recognise and welcome the great increase in support that it represents for children with special needs in our educational system.  However, not enough has yet been done to recognise the employment rights of SNAs, improve their working conditions and ensure they are treated in the workplace with the respect to which they are really entitled, given the vital contribution they make to our education system.<br\/><br\/>I hope the Minister will listen to what we are putting forward and I know other Labour Party colleagues will also speak on this.  We are appealing to colleagues across the House to support our motion and reject the amendment on the basis that we must ensure SNAs are treated with respect in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#HH00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513161000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:&rdquo; and substitute:&ldquo;- recognises the vital role that special needs assistants (SNAs) play in Ireland's Education system, providing essential support for some of the most vulnerable students in our classrooms;<br \/><br \/>- welcomes this Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that every child who is  assessed as needing SNA support continues to receive access to that support;<br \/><br \/>- commends the substantial increased annual investment in SNA provision which has seen  the number of SNAs increase from 10,575 in 2011 to 13,990 by the end of this year, an increase of 32% at a full annual cost of &euro;458 million;<br \/><br \/>- notes that Budget 2018 provided for over 1,000 additional special needs assistant posts with up to 130 commencing from January 2018 which would bring the number of SNAs to 14,100 and further posts commencing from September 2018;<br \/><br \/>- notes that some 34,000 children attending mainstream classes, special classes or special schools now receive the support of SNAs;<br \/><br \/>- notes that the Minister for Education and Skills formally requested the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to lead a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme aimed at providing better outcomes for students and ensuring that we are making the best additional investment for children with special educational needs;<br \/><br \/>- notes that in preparing its Report, the Minister for Education and Skills has asked the NCSE to consider the findings and recommendations of the Report on the Role of the Special Needs Assistant which was published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection in January 2016;<br \/><br \/>- notes that the NCSE will conclude its review and bring forward its report by the end of March 2018;<br \/><br \/>- welcomes the undertaking of the Minister for Education and Skills that schools will be informed of their SNA allocation for the 2018\/19 school year by the end of May 2018, fulfilling a commitment made by the Minister for Education and Skills in July 2017 that the notification of SNA allocations would be brought forward so that schools and parents can have greater certainty for the following school year; <br \/><br \/>- notes that by announcing SNA allocations for the 2018\/19 school year by the end of May 2018, the supplementary assignment arrangements &ndash; and distribution of available hours to serving staff in schools &ndash; will operate to full effect;<br \/><br \/>- notes that the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs have operated since 2013 which seek to maximise job security for SNAs and ensure that schools continue to put in place the best possible support for the children in their care, and notes the ongoing commitment of the Minister for Education and Skills to the effective operation of that scheme in consultation with education partners as provided for in national industrial relations agreements;<br \/><br \/>- notes that procedures are in place involving schools, school management bodies, the Department of Education and Skills and staff interests to deal with SNA grievances and issues at school and national level, and notes the commitment of the Minister for Education and Skills to continued engagement with staff interests and school management on industrial relations matters.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>I welcome the Minister here this afternoon, as well as our guests in the Gallery, who represent the SNA association.  During the worst years of the recession, the number of SNAs was not cut back by the current Government.  Emphasis was put on learning and learning outcomes, with everything put in place to support students who were most vulnerable.  That is most important.<\/p><p>More than 3,000 extra SNAs have been announced by the Minister since 2016, which is welcome.  In my area there have been a number of special needs assistants posts announced and I am involved with a school with a number of special needs assistants.  I have not come across many cases like those referred to by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, with people being asked to do things outside their remit.  The Senator received complaints in that respect but I have not come across them while being involved with many schools over many years.  The increased investment reflects the priority the Government has put on helping children with special educational needs to fulfil their potential.<\/p><p>A report was put in place and I compliment the former Senator and her committee at the time.  I know from meeting the Minister that the report has been taken on board.  When the Minister asked for a review, he also asked that the points made by the committee at the time be considered.  I understand that is being studied.  The Department is taking into account these requests relating to special needs assistants.  In 2013, a grievance support system was put in place by the then Minister responsible for education, former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and I understand it is still in place.  It has been worked on and has been strengthened as well.  If the SNAs had any grievance, they could speak to school management and bring it further.  The mechanism still exists so if people have a problem, they can move along a complaint.  I know the Minister has committed to the effective operation of the scheme in consultation with education partners, as provided for in the national industrial relations agreements.<\/p><p>Procedures are in place involving school management bodies.  I sit on a board of management and I know that although we have not had complaints from people representing SNAs, there have been past grievances.  They are aired at board of management meetings.  From my experience, boards of management are open and receptive to listening and dealing with the matters of the day.  I know from speaking to the Minister that he is willing to engage with staff interests and school management in all areas.  The Minister and his Department are very committed in this respect.  There has been a doubling of the number of special classes, and there has been a spread of autism spectrum disorder units, which are very necessary, right across the country.  They are not just in Dublin and can be found in the regions, small towns and rural areas.  The schools have specific units and children who were not able to attend mainstream classes are now able to do so.  <\/p><p>I pay tribute to all special needs assistants throughout the country as they do fantastic and Trojan work.  People like them have made it so much easier for children and they are very supportive of the students that they work with.  This is really to be commended and these people should be recognised for the work they do.  They have made the lives of students and their families easier through the support they give in conjunction with their work with the teacher and school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017121300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513161000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
