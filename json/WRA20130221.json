Introducing a lower rate of VAT on certain goods and services, halving the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI, and the freezing or reducing of the Annual Rate of Valuation by all but one Local Authority in 2012 should also help to ease the pressure on the sector.<\/p><p>  I will announce further measures to assist the retail sector in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, which will be launched in the coming days.

The Enterprise Development agencies were at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions. I am pleased to say that 2012 was a particularly good year for job creation in Agency supported companies with IDA client companies creating a total of 12,722 new jobs and Enterprise Ireland client companies creating a total of 12,861 new jobs.<\/p><p>  In the midlands and western regions, there are in excess of 39,000 people employed in full and part time employment by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies.<\/p><p>  For IDA purposes, the Midlands and West Region consists of the Counties Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath, Galway and Mayo.  The key sectors of focus for the Regions are life sciences, information and communications technologies and high value services activities. IDA primarily promotes the city of Galway and the towns of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore to potential investors.  In addition to attracting new FDI, IDA also works closely with its existing client companies with a view to getting them to upgrade and consolidate their existing businesses. The agency also works closely with the educational institutions and F&Aacute;S with a view to providing specialised training to for those interested in upskilling. <\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Midland region consists of Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath while the Western Region consists of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.

The agency supports companies to achieve productivity gains, internationalisation and export growth.  It assists with research and development, management skills acquisition, market information and seed and venture capital. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently introduced two targeted National schemes to support an additional flow of credit to SMEs; namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.

IDA Ireland has explained that, in seeking to achieve balanced regional development and the broader goal of securing new foreign direct investment (FDI) projects for Ireland in a very competitive global environment, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Ireland has only one such Region, the Greater Dublin area, so in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.<\/p><p>  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute within Regions and a project win in one location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas. In this context, during 2012 there were a number large job announcements in Louth which will have a positive economic impact, both directly and indirectly, on the Border Region as a whole. <\/p><p>  I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have, accordingly, raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations. <\/p><p>  That having been said, we must remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole. I have no doubt that the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, which is to be published in the coming days, will build on the achievements of the 2012 Plan and bring increased employment and prosperity to the regions generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100051#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100051#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[9060\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100051#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of additional jobs now on site through the investment in Vistamed in Carrick on Shannon.","asker":"1083","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>   Enterprise Ireland has had an active relationship with VistaMed and is working with the company to ensure growth is concentrated in Ireland.

I received the CLRG&rsquo;s report at the end of September and, shortly after that, I brought that report to the attention of the Government. The CLRG made five recommendations, which it separated into two categories &ndash; those that can be implemented straightaway and those that require more analysis. <\/p><p>  The CLRG&rsquo;s main conclusion was that there are some amendments that could be made to the existing process of examinership that would reduce costs and make it more easily available to small private companies. Accordingly, its first recommendation was that the Companies Acts be amended to allow small private companies to apply directly to the Circuit Court, rather than first to the High Court. As for medium sized companies, the CLRG recommended that they continue to have the option of going to the High Court for the appointment of an examiner. I have agreed with these recommendations and included provisions to give effect to them in the Companies Bill 2012, which was published on 21 December 2012. <\/p><p>  The CLRG went on to say that there could be scope for reducing the role of the courts in examinership further, and made proposals for the appointment of an examiner by an administrative, rather than judicial, decision. The CLRG envisaged that this procedure would require the involvement of a State agency to exercise this administrative decision, and identified the forthcoming new Insolvency Service, to be established under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, as the most appropriate agency.

No. 388 of 2002). Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (late payment interest) on the amount outstanding. <\/p><p>  The Late Payment Directive was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  Ireland must transpose the Recast Directive (2011\/7\/EU) to repeal the old legislation and modernise the old rules by March 2013.  I am happy to inform the House that I signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011\/7\/EU on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013 in full compliance with the Directive&rsquo;s requirements.<\/p><p>  The proposed legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.<\/p><p>  In addition to legislating for prompt payments, since 2009, Central Government Departments have been improving their respective payment times and are now obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced by the Government on an administrative basis.   Departments are required to report Quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target. The latest set of quarterly composite figures published on 30 January, 2013 by my Department show that 98% of payments made by Government Departments, valued at &euro;1.25bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.<\/p><p>  On 2 March 2011, the 15 day prompt payment rule was extended beyond central Government Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (excluding Commercial Semi-State bodies), in respect of valid invoices received, on or after, 1 July 2011. <\/p><p>  As part of this new extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish on their respective websites Quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis. The individual bodies covered by this arrangement are also required to publish their own Quarterly reports on their respective websites.<\/p><p>  These new reporting arrangements will ensure that Ministers will be able to monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and will enable them to address any issues with those bodies who are not meeting obligations in respect of prompt payments.<\/p><p>  The Government will continue to pursue work in this area which is critically important to the cash requirements of business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013, which is currently being developed and will be published shortly, is a key element in the Government's policy approach to rebuilding the economy and getting people back to work.  It will continue to build on the recent achievements by driving the 15 day payment period across the public sector and enhance the ability for business to attach officially new payment requirements to relevant invoices.  It will also deliver on enhanced working relationships with representative bodies to ensure that business is fully aware of developments in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100052#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business Regulation","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100052#WRC01525"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[9066\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100052#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the efforts he has made to reduce the cost of doing business in the past two years.","asker":"1102","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>Reducing costs for business is a central theme of the Action Plan for Jobs.

However, in the period from April 2008 to July 2012, Irish cost competitiveness improved by 19% as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Prices have now fallen back to levels last seen in 2002. Over half of this improvement is attributable to favourable exchange rate movements.<\/p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s research benchmarks Ireland&rsquo;s performance against a number of our key trading partners, as well as the OECD and Euro area averages.  Some of the key messages emerging from the benchmarking exercise are that: <\/p><p>- Labour costs in Ireland have fallen marginally since 2008.  While wage growth has started to resume of late, it is at a lower rate than elsewhere in the Euro area, meaning that our labour cost competitiveness continues to improve. <\/p><p>- Construction and rental costs have fallen significantly since the collapse of the property bubble. Rental costs for office space declined by 45% in the period 2007-2011.

However, numbers have stabilised over the last two years.  Some 205,700 people are now directly employed in manufacturing, full-time and part-time, and a similar number of people are employed indirectly.  There was a 2.8% increase in manufacturing output in 2012 over 2011.  It is noteworthy that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite challenges in many of our key markets.  Final 2012 export data published by the Central Statistics Office last week showed that goods exports increased by 1% over 2011, reaching a total of &euro;92 billion, which was the highest figure since 2002.  To promote job opportunities in this sector, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included several specific initiatives to develop the sector.  Further measures to drive and develop manufacturing will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, which I recently finalised on behalf of the Government and will be published in the coming days.  The Manufacturing Development Forum, which I established last year, has provided valuable insights.  I have asked Forf&aacute;s to develop a new Strategy for Manufacturing up to 2020 and this study is being finalised.  A new report on the skills needs of the sector, which is also being finalised at present, will be a key driver in pursing those specific needs.  While manufacturing has been an important sector in Ireland since the 1960s, there has been a noticeable decline in numbers employed in the sector.  This is not necessarily surprising, as it echoes what has been happening in most developed economies.  A similar trend has been experienced in other industrialised countries such as Germany, the UK, the US, Netherlands and Korea.  Arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, it is clear that the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be change.  There will be an inevitable movement of production of lower cost, less specialised goods towards cheaper labour economies, e.g. in Asia.  This is part of a wider global pattern.  Despite the considerable challenges in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing sector in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher-value subsectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, among others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100054#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100054#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[9088\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100054#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the next action plan for jobs will contain specific measures that take account of regional disparity in unemployment rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[9073\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100054#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the next action plan on jobs will include specific regional measures in view of the geographical disparity in unemployment rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[9102\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100054#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the next action plan on jobs will place a particular emphasis on targeting unemployment black spots; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 43 together.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a national plan aimed at providing a supporting operating environment for businesses to start up and expand.  The Action Plan does not include specific regional sub-plans.  However, many of the actions which will be contained in the 2013 Plan will have a positive impact at regional and local level.  For example, the restructuring of the CEBs and the establishment of the Local Enterprise Offices will provide an enhanced level of supports for business start-ups throughout the country, while the continued roll-out of the new INTREO employment services by the Department of Social Protection will offer practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will continue to support job creation projects throughout the country and in all regions.  In 2012, IDA Ireland client companies created a total of 12,722 new jobs, with net job creation of 6,570, representing the highest level of growth in a decade.  The agency attracted 145 individual investments, with 66 of those from companies coming to Ireland for the first time.  Apart from companies locating in Dublin, investments were also announced for a number of regional locations including Letterkenny, Sligo, Mayo, Westport, Galway, Louth, Dundalk, Drogheda, Kildare, Leixlip, Kilkenny, Bray, Cork and Limerick.  IDA Ireland has also made a further 12 announcements so far in 2013.  Seven of these announcements relate to investments in Cork, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick and are expected to create over 637 jobs in those locations.  Enterprise Ireland client companies increased their employment by over 3,300 in 2012.  Meanwhile, commitments to new jobs in the future by Enterprise Ireland clients amounted to over 7,000, exceeding the target of 6,250 for the year.

The European Single Market has made cross-border trading in the EU easier and more certain, for both businesses and consumers.  Certain operating costs and\/or barriers to trade can be outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.

Such measures included: reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms; reducing the administrative burden on business; placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the Legal Services Bill; providing supports to businesses to improve their energy and resource efficiency; helping businesses to improve their skills, and encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates and other local charges.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, my Department and its Agencies are closely involved in supporting enterprise projects under the <i>Interreg<\/i> initiative, which assists cross-border development and which is co-funded by the EU and by the relevant Northern Ireland Departments.

It is sometimes a combination of these factors that causes a company to close.  However, I am aware that many retail and commercial companies are concerned about the impact which upward only rent reviews are having on their cost base.  When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28th   February 2010.<\/p><p>  The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords.  On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible.  In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.  I understand that by the end of 2012, NAMA had received 276 eligible applications for rent abatement and had granted 212 applications with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million.  A further 56 applications were under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received, only 8 were refused, representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA.  In addition, the Property Services (Regulation) Act, 2011, provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  The database will go toward enhancing transparency in the commercial property market when it becomes operational.<\/p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs process, the Government is working to ensure that other factors which impact on the competitiveness of enterprises across the economy are addressed.

These reports are reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of the Department.

Civil society organisations play an important role in bringing citizens together to act collectively and participate in the development of their own countries and communities.  They have a strong role to play in demanding better services from the state and holding governments to account.<\/p><p><br \/>  In some developing countries, civil society organisations have come under increasing pressure in recent years as they seek to play their legitimate role in society.  In these countries, dialogue with civil society organisations is limited and the space for civil society engagement remains narrow or is, in some cases, shrinking.  This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  Through the Government&#8217;s aid programme, we work to protect the space in which civil society organisations operate, and to foster an enabling environment for the work.  We channel a higher proportion of our development assistance through civil society organisations than other international donors.  Of Ireland&#8217;s total aid budget of &#8364;623 million this year, about a quarter will be channelled through civil society organisations to support their valuable work in, for example, improving access to health care and education, supporting livelihoods, and strengthening accountability, governance and democracy.  Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, are specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  In Ireland&#8217;s nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.  Ireland&#8217;s partnerships in these countries are founded on respect for human rights, and we will continue to emphasise in our dialogue with partner governments that it is essential to ensure the role of civil society organisations is enhanced. <\/p><p><br \/>  Internationally, we have agreed, by signing up to the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, to implement fully our commitments to enable civil society organisations to exercise their role as independent development actors.  At the meeting of Development Ministers under the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Luxembourg in October last, I gave strong support to new Conclusions on Europe's engagement with civil society.  These commit Member States &quot;to support and promote an enabling environment for an independent, pluralistic and active civil society in partner countries&quot;<i>.  <\/i>The EU will work to improve our dialogue with civil society organisations on the ground, and to continue close monitoring of legislation, regulations and other restrictions on the operation of civil society organisations in our partner countries. <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council presents a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society.  We intend to advance this issue during our term on the Council, building on a successful meeting on consolidating the space for civil society which Ireland organised during the September 2012 Human Rights Council session.  Ireland is also championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&#8217; human rights records, including the treatment of civil society actors and human rights defenders.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government will continue to promote civil society-led initiatives and to support other arrangements at national and international level to promote and monitor an enabling environment for civil society organisations  . <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100056#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100057#WRH00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100057#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[9313\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100057#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the main changes in the property tax in relation to the unemployed, senior citizens and the disabled, exemptions, waivers and so on.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 which I announced to the House last week.  Certain provisions included in the Bill may apply to individuals who are unemployed, senior citizens or disabled.  It should be noted that the changes to which I refer are subject to the enactment of the Bill.  An exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) will apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individuals as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court or where a trust has been established specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Bill also provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The reduction is limited to the lesser of the market value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, residential properties that have been certified as having significant pyritic damage will be exempt from LPT for a temporary period of approximately three years.  Regulations will be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government stipulating how properties are to be tested to establish whether they have been affected by a significant level of pyrite-induced damage and providing for the issue of certificates by a competent person where this has been established.<\/p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 already contains a number of specific deferral provisions that cater for cases of low income and significant mortgage interest burden.  However, I appreciate that these may not cater sufficiently for some specific situations and, in the Amendment Bill, I am proposing additional categories of property owners that may qualify for a deferral of the local property tax payable.  These include the personal representatives of a deceased liable person and an individual who enters into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p><p>  A further provision will allows for a measure of discretion by the Revenue Commissioners to grant a full or partial deferral in very particular circumstances where a person suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay the LPT without causing excessive financial hardship.

Nevertheless, as referred to by the Deputy, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us &#8364;1bn closer to attaining out 3% deficit target by 2015.

I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate and how it impacts on business in being timely compliant. For example, Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through the difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.<\/p><p>  In regard to Sheriffs, I am advised that Revenue serves certificates through Revenue Sheriffs. However in the cases of Dublin City, Dublin County, Cork City and Cork County, these certificates are served through the County Sheriff and County Registrar. In all other counties Revenue Sheriff and County Registrar duties are carried out by separate individuals. It should be noted that Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended.<\/p><p>  Revenue issued 31,065 certificates in 2012 in respect of outstanding tax liabilities with a cumulative value of &euro;373.6m. The Sheriffs recovered a total of &euro;151.3m in respect of those certificates.  The Sheriffs are not accountable to Revenue in relation to their operational activities. Therefore the information requested by the Deputy in relation to seizure of goods by the Sheriffs is not maintained by Revenue. I am advised however that Revenue understands that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not complied with requests for payment.<\/p><p>  In regard to attachment, Revenue issued 4,039 orders in 2012 with a cumulative value of &euro;178.5m. It recovered a total of &euro;38.4m in respect of those orders. The Deputy should note that Revenue issues attachment orders directly and does not operate through either the Sheriffs or County Registrars.<\/p><p>  Finally, Revenue will always take the appropriate collection and enforcement action to ensure timely compliance, including referral of cases to the Sheriffs and the issue of attachment orders where necessary. However as mentioned already, Revenue will work with taxpayers or businesses to find a mutually acceptable arrangement before any enforcement activity is commenced, providing there is open and honest engagement and I fully support Revenue in this approach.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100058#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Bonds","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100058#WRJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[9480\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100058#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in the context of the deal on the promissory notes reached with the European Central Bank, if the ECB can instruct the Central Bank of Ireland to dispose of the Government bonds at an accelerated pace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>The Government bonds now held by the Central Bank following the liquidation of IBRC will be placed in the trading portfolio of the Central Bank, and these bonds will be sold as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit.

In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.

A special Government Sub-Committee is already in place since March last year to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.  At official level, my Department is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department&#8217;s Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;).  The Government&#8217;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas &#8211; Personal Insolvency, a Mortgage Advisory Service, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme, and Engagement with the Banks, and considerable progress has now been achieved across this agenda.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank also has a key role to engage with the mortgage lenders and to require them to meaningfully engage with their customers who have difficulty meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Central Bank, under its MARS project, has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they have a range of longer term options, such as &#8216;trade-down mortgages&#8217;, &#8216;split mortgages&#8217; and &#8216;sale by agreement&#8217; or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders for their distressed mortgage customers, and that they have the capacity to implement these in an effective manner.  While progress in this area has not been as rapid as desired, it is true to say that greater effort and resources are now being deployed across the banks to this issue and real engagement on resolution options should now be further enhanced.  In that context, I welcome the recent statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland at a conference on distressed property markets that, having ensured that the banks are much better staffed and organized for dealing with arrears, the Central Bank will be setting out its quantitative expectations for their effectiveness in achieving lasting solutions.  The focus of this work for 2013 will be on the implementation of these strategies and that banks have the operational capability to implement effectively.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) remains a key framework to govern the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulty and their bank and offers very worthwhile protections.  The CCMA provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Central Bank has commenced a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and this will include a public consultation.  The CCMA requires updating due to the introduction of both the Personal Insolvency legislation and longer term mortgage resolution options.  The review will also take into consideration recent developments that may be relevant to the issue of mortgage arrears and clarifications issued by the Central Bank since the current version was issued.  In addition, the Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &#8216;Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217; and this is available on the Central Bank website, <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ultimately the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will address the real social and economic problems associated with high levels of personal indebtedness.  That is why Government is focussed through its many new initiatives at fostering and generating economic growth.

The process for designation is designed to ensure educational quality, objectivity, international expertise, fairness and transparency.  The first stage requires institutes of technology to submit a formal expression of interest in merging and seeking designation. The Higher Education Authority are considering proposals and their advice on system configuration later this year will include their advice on the progress of institutes of technology interested in seeking designation to the second stage of the designation process.<\/p><p>  The joint Government-Industry Action Plan, which I launched in January 2012, has been developed as a direct response to specific ICT skills shortages.

with its &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; Strategy, IDA Ireland is aiming to create 62,000 new jobs, giving a total impact of 105,000 jobs, over the period 2010 to 2014. The Agency is also aiming to secure 640 investments, with 50% of these located outside of Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that IDA Ireland is making good progress in implementing its Strategy. Over the last three years, the Agency has secured 419 investments and delivered 36,000 gross jobs. While the objective of securing 50% of investments outside of Dublin and Cork is proving particularly challenging, it must be acknowledged that, during 2012, a number of IDA client companies made significant investments in regional locations as follows: Paypal, 1,000 jobs in Dundalk; Abbott, 175 jobs in Sligo; Mylan, 200 jobs in Galway; Allergan, 200 jobs in Westport; and Northern Trust, 400 jobs in Limerick.  Last week saw another significant announcement for Dundalk with e Bay announcing 450 jobs in Dundalk. <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to work towards achieving its target of creating a further 12,000 jobs in 2013. A range of actions to support the achievement of this objective will be taken by the Agency this year in the context of the Government&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, details of which will be announced shortly.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment, it will be necessary to undertake an in depth analysis of our FDI strategy with a view to informing the formulation of an appropriate strategy for the period post 2014. This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100061#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Property Portfolio","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100062#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[9358\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100062#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the plans the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland have for a vacant unit (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Industrial Development Acts, the management of industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the enterprise agencies and not one in which I have a function.

Through the Action Plan for Jobs process, the Government is attempting to address those issues that are within its remit to change.  <\/p><p>  Key areas which I have been working on directly to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance, and supporting innovation.

However, in order to allow us to protect the core weekly payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance, the Government had to look very carefully at other additional payments, such as the respite care grant. <\/p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department, among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care), and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  Such an annual payment, in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  <\/p><p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance which such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.<\/p><p>  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to be &euro;776 million in 2013.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 was over &euro;771 million: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 on domiciliary care allowance. This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011.  There are currently over 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Of these, over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million.  Approximately 1,700 people are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  The numbers in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment from the Department have increased by more than 150% in the last 10 years from 20,000 in 2001 to 52,000 in 2012.  Expenditure on the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme has increased by almost 220% in the same period.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to approximately 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  This includes people who are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who are in receipt of both DCA and carer&rsquo;s allowance receive one respite payment.  In addition, some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment receive the grant.<\/p><p>  The current rate of the respite care grant (&euro;1,375) remains significantly higher, and still more than double what it was in 2002 (&euro;635). Expenditure on the grant has increased by 290% since 2005 from &euro;34.3 million to &euro;135 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  While the respite care grant is an important income support for carers, respite services are provided by the HSE, not through income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection.  A survey carried out in 2006 indicated that the respite care grant, in the majority of cases, is not used for respite care.<\/p><p>  If a person getting a social welfare payment has a once-off exceptional expense which they cannot reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income, they may apply for an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[9394\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to make any changes to the jobs initiative programme; if she has decided to phase this programme out over the coming months and to cease the programme by the end of the year; if she will provide long term participants on the scheme with alternative employment; if she has discussed the consequences of such a decision with her Cabinet colleagues; the steps she has taken to replace the services provided by the job initiative scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The Job Initiative (JI) scheme was launched in 1996.

In 2013, my Department will spend over &euro;2.8 billion on supports to families and children and we need to be sure that this major investment delivers good outcomes.  To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established in 2011 the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues and make cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.<\/p><p>  I was pleased to publish the first report of the Advisory Group examining child and family income supports on 20 February.  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most.  The report records that while some members of the advisory group found that taxation of child benefit is an attractive reform option, it was recognised that this approach, being limited to only one child and family income support payment, does not contribute to a better overall design of the child and family income support system.  For this and other reasons, there was a strong preference in the group for another approach based on a two-tier child and family income support payment approach.  The group considered that this would allow for a rationalisation of the overall child income support system while minimising work disincentives and allow for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different household types.<\/p><p>  Given a range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  Issues relating to changes in taxation policy are a matter for my colleague, Michael Noonan T.D., Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, while taking into account further work by the advisory group on social protection and taxation supports for working age persons as well as more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Eligibility","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01750"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[9421\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100063#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding domiciliary care allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was received on the 11th January 2013.

My Department&#8217;s involvement with CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the scheme, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Under the CLSS funding of up to 100% of the approved cost of projects was provided by the Housing Finance Agency, through the local authorities, to a pproved h ousing b odies for the provision of accommodation for low-income families and persons with specific categories of housing need.

KCS sets the future direction of fire services in a way that aligns fire services and fire safety in Ireland with international good practice. <\/p><p>  The KCS policy document was prepared by my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management through a collaborative approach between central and local government, involving expert input by Chief Fire Officers and fire services personnel. The development process also included stakeholder consultation and engagement by the National Directorate with relevant technical organisations to ensure the best fit between up-to-date thinking and Ireland&rsquo;s needs. This document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire.  The National Directorate takes account of international research to inform its work. However international research of itself cannot provide a fire safety model for Ireland. It is necessary to take information, mindful of its context, and use it in preparing a best fit for Ireland&rsquo;s needs, issues, circumstances, objectives and possibilities. The international literature used to inform the overall approach, as well as the detail of several sections, is referenced in the text and listed in Appendix D of the Document.<\/p><p>  The National Directorate also had the benefit of oversight and expert support from Strathclyde Fire and Rescue service. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue are highly regarded internationally for the quality of their fire service, and the impact of changes on improved safety outcomes. They also provide services to half of Scotland&rsquo;s population ranging from its largest city, Glasgow, to isolated rural communities, and therefore is a particularly good fit with Ireland&rsquo;s national demographics. KCS sets out a holistic, systems approach to achieving the objective of keeping communities safe from fire. The systems approach to safety management is recognised internationally and is applied in many spheres. The Risk Management approach of the type used in KCS is generally seen to involve five stages including identifying hazards and evaluating the risks these hazards pose, mitigating those risks by trying to reduce the probability of the event and\/ or its consequences if it does occur, planning and preparing to deal with the risk, responding to an event, and reviewing events with a view to learning for the future. <\/p><p>  The &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo; document includes core standards and guidance for fire authorities which they will implement in delivering their statutory functions. It is supported by a series of subject-specific documents dealing with fire service training, safety management systems for fire services, preparation of statutory &lsquo;Section 26&rsquo; Plans and guidance on a risk indexing method for individual buildings which also set out core processes and standards for fire service work. A further series of documents titled &lsquo;Good Practice Notes&rsquo; (GPNs), describing the approach taken to specific issues by individual fire authorities, endorsed at national level, aims to achieve consistent good practice and cross-authority learning. Together with the main policy document, the full suite of documents comprises a comprehensive Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[9486\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on whether there are less firefighters per head of population here compared to the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>There is no comparative study readily available of the type referred to relating to inputs to fire service provision.

Dublin&rsquo;s fire service serves a population of some 1.1 million people with approximately 1, 000 staff, making it slightly below the 1,000 per million population mark.  As noted above, fire-fighter numbers are but one potential measure of resource in put to fire service provision.

While every death from fire is a death too many, the provisional toll for 2012, with 28 people killed in fires, is the lowest annual figure for fire deaths for four decades. I give full credit to communities themselves as well as everyone involved in fire safety and fire services for the work which has brought about this consistent reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s fire death rate to a figure of approximately 6 fire fatalities per million of population. Achieving this level of community safety places Ireland in the very top league of fire safe countries, and our challenge now is to sustain this high level of safety from fire.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Application Numbers","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR01150"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[9489\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of grants awarded respectively under each of the grants available under the housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability in each of the years since November 2007; the total amount allocated to local authorities by his Department for these schemes in each of these years broken down by local authority; the total amount in matching funds by local authorities in each of these years with a breakdown by local authority where these figures are readily available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants.

The Policing Plan contained the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station network.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of communities throughout the country.  In particular, it is of the utmost importance to maximise the time that our well-trained and highly skilled Garda&iacute; spend on front-line duties.  This involves the deployment of Garda resources to best advantage and the Garda Commissioner has indicated that the freeing-up of Garda personnel from desk duties arising from the implementation of the 2013 Policing Plan will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  It is, of course, a matter for the Commissioner to put the necessary policing measures in place to take account of the closure of the stations in question.  One of the elements involved is that the Garda authorities are in the process of providing a number of mobile offices which will assist members of the public to conduct their business and, also, to interact with Garda personnel.   However, the Deputy will appreciate that this is only a small portion of the relevant Garda operation and I understand from the Garda authorities that where stations have been closed in 2013 a comprehensive set of revised structures has been put in place.  In this context, the Garda authorities have emphasised that the Force will continue to support the relevant communities through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation facilitates enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[9409\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he wil provide an update on an application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare.","asker":"974","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":508,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in June, 2011.<\/p><p>  The application is being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.

This agreed a 3% cut in the CAP budget and a 7% cut in the overall EU budget The formula agreed by the Heads of State and Government for the distribution of direct payment funds between Member States had originally been proposed by Ireland, and resulted in a relatively favourable outcome for this country.  The result is that the level of direct payments made to Irish farmers has been largely protected, with a cut of 3.3% in current terms in order to accommodate new Member States and due to the overall cut in the Budget.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This reduction in the national ceiling will be applied across the board to all Irish farmers, and is a separate issue from the proposed convergence of direct payments within each Member State.<\/p><p><br \/>  All the data set out below is drawn from the Department&#8217;s modelling database, which is based on actual payments to farmers in 2010.  Total payments covered by the database amount to &#8364;1,250 million.  The Deputy should note that this database has recently been updated with more detailed information on payments in 2010, so results may vary slightly from previous answers to Parliamentary Questions.  The purpose of the database is specifically<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  to model the impact of alternative approaches to internal convergence, rather than to deal with all of the Commission proposals on direct payments, such as the young farmer&#8217;s scheme, the national reserve, etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  If &#8364;350 per hectare were paid on the first 25 hectares of each farm, this would leave a balance of &#8364;178 per hectare for the remaining land.  Note as stated above that this is based on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  If farmers were paid a flat rate per hectare, as in the Commission&#8217;s original proposals, each farmer would be paid &#8364;272 per hectare, based on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.  <\/p><p><br \/>  If farmers were paid a flat rate of &#8364;272 per hectare, but the total payment per farmer was then capped at &#8364;50,000, this would create a saving of &#8364;24 million from around 1,000 farmers.  This would allow for a top-up of &#8364;5 per hectare to be paid to all other farmers, based again on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Division","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[9419\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when final vesting will take place in relation to a commonage (details supplied) in County Galway; if any outstanding issues remain to be resolved; if he will provide the details of these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p> Whereas my Department has prepared a draft Vesting Order, it cannot be lodged with the Property Registration for the moment as there are a number of outstanding clarifications required concerning the grazing rights.

The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy. <\/p><p>Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the X case judgment is the law in of the State and the Oireachtas is legally bound to adhere to this interpretation. In order for the risk of suicide to be removed as a ground for lawful abortion, a referendum must be held.  Indeed two referendums have been held to attempt to remove the risk of suicide as a ground for lawful abortion and they were both defeated.  It is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there is a &quot;threat&quot; of suicide - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will know, last December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C v Ireland case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case.

Accordingly, the issue of an adequate number of intern places in the Irish medical system is a priority for my Department and for the HSE. <\/p><p>  The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training on the Intern Year.  This Group has issued two Reports, the most recent, the Second Interim Report, in April 2012.<\/p><p>  The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  There were 572 such posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Graduate Statistics","counter":610,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":611,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[9291\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of graduates there are from Irish medical schools in any given year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":612,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of medical graduates from Irish medical schools can vary from year to year.

While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role. Autism is described as a spectrum disorder that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe. The first signs of autism may appear as developmental delay before the age of 3. Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity. <\/p><p><br \/>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for autism it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention. The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a financial support scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection for children with severe disabilities including children with autism who require continuous care and attention. <\/p><p><br \/>  Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization, agree that there is no link between the MMR or any other vaccine and autism. Vaccination is a safe and effective means of protecting children from serious and occasionally fatal illness. The safety of all medicines licensed in Ireland, including vaccines is monitored continuously by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB). Various data sources are used, including reports of suspected adverse reactions received from Ireland and worldwide, regular safety updates from the companies, the worldwide medical literature, data from epidemiological studies and information from independent researchers, as well as from other regulatory authorities around the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, current Government policy advocates a mainstreaming approach to the provision of services and supports for people with disabilities including those with autism, whereby people with  disabilities have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate supports and interventions to address individual needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE completed a review of the autism services provided by the health sector for both children and adults with autism in 2012. Its <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report,<\/i> reviews and identifies appropriate pathways of care for individuals with autism, given the existing diverse system of delivering services and varied approaches across the health sector. It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government&#8217;s mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs. It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate. It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People(0-18s) Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.<\/p><p>The National Review of Autism Services<i><\/i>Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[9490\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 261 of 29 November 2012, if he will provide details of the numbers on waiting lists in respect of assessment and treatment for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy with a breakdown by therapy and by duration on the waiting list and by area and by age category","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[9491\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount allocated and the outturn in respect of local schemes that is drugs schemes in each of the past five years with a breakdown by its constituent parts","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>My Department administers a Drugs Initiative, which primarily funds community based drugs initiatives supported by Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.

On the contrary the aim is to strengthen the programme by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure, by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services. <\/p><p> Since\u00a0becoming Minister with responsibility for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated\u00a0have been aimed at ensuring that into the\u00a0future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport\u00a0needs of all users.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport, NIRT Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. <\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened. <\/p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently.  I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100066#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRS00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":752,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[9350\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the resources available to Garda Stations (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":753,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel and transport, throughout An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I have no direct function in the matter.<\/p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Greystones, Newtownmountkennedy, Wicklow and Arklow Garda Stations on 31 December 2012, the latest date for which all figures are readily available, was as set out in the table hereunder:<\/p><p><pli4><table><tr><th>Station<\/th><th><div>Strength<\/div><\/th><th><div>Reserves<\/div><\/th><th><div>Civilians<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Greystones<\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newtownmountkennedy<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Arklow<\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/pli4><pli0>  Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.

The Policing Plan contained the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station network.<\/p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of communities throughout the country.  In particular, it is of the utmost importance to maximise the time that our well-trained and highly skilled Garda&iacute; spend on front-line duties.  This involves the deployment of Garda resources to best advantage and the Garda Commissioner has indicated that the freeing-up of Garda personnel from desk duties arising from the implementation of the 2013 Policing Plan will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.<\/p><p>  It is, of course, a matter for the Commissioner to put the necessary policing measures in place to take account of the closure of the stations in question.  One of the elements involved is that the Garda authorities are in the process of providing a number of mobile offices which will assist members of the public to conduct their business and, also, to interact with Garda personnel.   However, the Deputy will appreciate that this is only a small portion of the relevant Garda operation and I understand from the Garda authorities that where stations have been closed in 2013 a comprehensive set of revised structures has been put in place.  In this context, the Garda authorities have emphasised that the Force will continue to support the relevant communities through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation facilitates enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[9409\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he wil provide an update on an application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare.","asker":"974","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in June, 2011.<\/p><p>  The application is being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.

This agreed a 3% cut in the CAP budget and a 7% cut in the overall EU budget The formula agreed by the Heads of State and Government for the distribution of direct payment funds between Member States had originally been proposed by Ireland, and resulted in a relatively favourable outcome for this country.  The result is that the level of direct payments made to Irish farmers has been largely protected, with a cut of 3.3% in current terms in order to accommodate new Member States and due to the overall cut in the Budget.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This reduction in the national ceiling will be applied across the board to all Irish farmers, and is a separate issue from the proposed convergence of direct payments within each Member State.<\/p><p><br \/>  All the data set out below is drawn from the Department&#8217;s modelling database, which is based on actual payments to farmers in 2010.  Total payments covered by the database amount to &#8364;1,250 million.  The Deputy should note that this database has recently been updated with more detailed information on payments in 2010, so results may vary slightly from previous answers to Parliamentary Questions.  The purpose of the database is specifically<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  to model the impact of alternative approaches to internal convergence, rather than to deal with all of the Commission proposals on direct payments, such as the young farmer&#8217;s scheme, the national reserve, etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  If &#8364;350 per hectare were paid on the first 25 hectares of each farm, this would leave a balance of &#8364;178 per hectare for the remaining land.  Note as stated above that this is based on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  If farmers were paid a flat rate per hectare, as in the Commission&#8217;s original proposals, each farmer would be paid &#8364;272 per hectare, based on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.  <\/p><p><br \/>  If farmers were paid a flat rate of &#8364;272 per hectare, but the total payment per farmer was then capped at &#8364;50,000, this would create a saving of &#8364;24 million from around 1,000 farmers.  This would allow for a top-up of &#8364;5 per hectare to be paid to all other farmers, based again on total payments of &#8364;1,250 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Division","counter":856,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[9419\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when final vesting will take place in relation to a commonage (details supplied) in County Galway; if any outstanding issues remain to be resolved; if he will provide the details of these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p> Whereas my Department has prepared a draft Vesting Order, it cannot be lodged with the Property Registration for the moment as there are a number of outstanding clarifications required concerning the grazing rights.

The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy. <\/p><p>Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the X case judgment is the law in of the State and the Oireachtas is legally bound to adhere to this interpretation. In order for the risk of suicide to be removed as a ground for lawful abortion, a referendum must be held.  Indeed two referendums have been held to attempt to remove the risk of suicide as a ground for lawful abortion and they were both defeated.  It is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there is a &quot;threat&quot; of suicide - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will know, last December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C v Ireland case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case.

Accordingly, the issue of an adequate number of intern places in the Irish medical system is a priority for my Department and for the HSE. <\/p><p>  The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training on the Intern Year.  This Group has issued two Reports, the most recent, the Second Interim Report, in April 2012.<\/p><p>  The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  There were 572 such posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Graduate Statistics","counter":891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":892,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[9291\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of graduates there are from Irish medical schools in any given year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":893,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of medical graduates from Irish medical schools can vary from year to year.

While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role. Autism is described as a spectrum disorder that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe. The first signs of autism may appear as developmental delay before the age of 3. Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity. <\/p><p><br \/>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for autism it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention. The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a financial support scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection for children with severe disabilities including children with autism who require continuous care and attention. <\/p><p><br \/>  Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization, agree that there is no link between the MMR or any other vaccine and autism. Vaccination is a safe and effective means of protecting children from serious and occasionally fatal illness. The safety of all medicines licensed in Ireland, including vaccines is monitored continuously by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB). Various data sources are used, including reports of suspected adverse reactions received from Ireland and worldwide, regular safety updates from the companies, the worldwide medical literature, data from epidemiological studies and information from independent researchers, as well as from other regulatory authorities around the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, current Government policy advocates a mainstreaming approach to the provision of services and supports for people with disabilities including those with autism, whereby people with  disabilities have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate supports and interventions to address individual needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE completed a review of the autism services provided by the health sector for both children and adults with autism in 2012. Its <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report,<\/i> reviews and identifies appropriate pathways of care for individuals with autism, given the existing diverse system of delivering services and varied approaches across the health sector. It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government&#8217;s mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs. It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate. It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People(0-18s) Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.<\/p><p>The National Review of Autism Services<i><\/i>Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[9490\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 261 of 29 November 2012, if he will provide details of the numbers on waiting lists in respect of assessment and treatment for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy with a breakdown by therapy and by duration on the waiting list and by area and by age category","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes","counter":988,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":989,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[9491\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount allocated and the outturn in respect of local schemes that is drugs schemes in each of the past five years with a breakdown by its constituent parts","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":990,"content":"<p>My Department administers a Drugs Initiative, which primarily funds community based drugs initiatives supported by Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.

On the contrary the aim is to strengthen the programme by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure, by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services. <\/p><p> Since\u00a0becoming Minister with responsibility for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated\u00a0have been aimed at ensuring that into the\u00a0future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport\u00a0needs of all users.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport, NIRT Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. <\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened. <\/p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently.  I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100067#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1033,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":1032,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1033,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[9368\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to a station (details supplied) in County Kerry since 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1034,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Kilgarvan Garda Station in each of the years from 2002 was 1.<\/p><p>  Kilgarvan was one of the Garda Stations listed for closure in the Policing Plan for 2013 and closed on 31 January 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[9369\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100068#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total cost of the cleaning service at a Garda station (details supplied) in County Kerry since 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>The arrangements made for the provision of services at Garda stations is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.

This agreed a 3% cut in the CAP budget and a 7% cut in the overall EU budget The formula agreed by the Heads of State and Government for the distribution of direct payment funds between Member States had originally been proposed by Ireland, and resulted in a relatively favourable outcome for this country.  The result is that the level of direct payments made to Irish farmers has been largely protected, with a cut of 3.3% in current terms in order to accommodate new Member States and due to the overall cut in the Budget.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This reduction in the national ceiling will be applied across the board to all Irish farmers, and is a separate issue from the proposed convergence of direct payments within each Member State.<\/p><p><br \/>  All the data set out below is drawn from the Department&#8217;s modelling database, which is based on actual payments to farmers in 2010.  Total payments covered by the database amount to &#8364;1,250 million.  The Deputy should note that this database has recently been updated with more detailed information on payments in 2010, so results may vary slightly from previous answers to Parliamentary Questions.  The purpose of the database is specifically<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  to model the impact of alternative approaches to internal convergence, rather than to deal with all of the Commission proposals on direct payments, such as the young farmer&#8217;s scheme, the national reserve, etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  If &#8364;350 per hectare were paid on the first 25 hectares of each farm, this would leave a balance of &#8364;178 per hectare for the remaining land.

The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy. <\/p><p>Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the X case judgment is the law in of the State and the Oireachtas is legally bound to adhere to this interpretation. In order for the risk of suicide to be removed as a ground for lawful abortion, a referendum must be held.  Indeed two referendums have been held to attempt to remove the risk of suicide as a ground for lawful abortion and they were both defeated.  It is inaccurate to suggest that termination will be permitted in cases where there is a &quot;threat&quot; of suicide - rather it will only be permitted where it is established by expert medical opinion that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will know, last December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C v Ireland case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case. They also agreed to make appropriate amendments to the criminal law in this area. <\/p><p>The aim of this Bill is to regulate access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the X case, and provide for the drafting of regulations to deal with operational and<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>procedural matters relevant to the issue.

While my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, has lead responsibility in implementing the Fottrell recommendations, the increased intake will result in a requirement for additional intern places for graduates in the health service. Of course it is important that these graduates are given an opportunity to work in Irish hospitals. Accordingly, the issue of an adequate number of intern places in the Irish medical system is a priority for my Department and for the HSE. <\/p><p>  The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the National Committee on Medical Education and Training on the Intern Year.  This Group has issued two Reports, the most recent, the Second Interim Report, in April 2012.<\/p><p>  The intern year is an integral part of medical training and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 it is a matter for the HSE to assess, on an annual basis, the number of intern training posts required by the health service.  There were 572 such posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  It should be noted that under EU law intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test; meet the HSE English language requirements; provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate; and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  The HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July 2013. In total there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013 and the HSE consider that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100071#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Graduate Statistics","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100072#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[9291\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100072#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of graduates there are from Irish medical schools in any given year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of medical graduates from Irish medical schools can vary from year to year.

The National Audiology Review Group developed a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the inconsistencies and inadequacies in audiology services which are contained in the HSE Report of the National Review of Audiology Services published in April 2011.   <\/p><p>This report provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new- born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation. That report included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.<\/p><p>  Since then, the HSE Audiology Clinical Care Programme was formed to oversee the implementation of the recommendations detailed by this report.  Progress is being made on  the modernisation  of  audiology  services  in  Ireland  with the  introduction of a universal  national  programme  of new-born  hearing screening  a key priority.<\/p><p>Beaumont Hospital is the centre for delivering Ireland&rsquo;s national cochlear implant programme, with surgical provision for patients under six (6) years carried out in the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital Temple Street.   While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential cochlear implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. \tIt is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved.<\/p><p>  I am aware that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.   The introduction of this service is a matter between the HSE and Beaumont hospital and the HSE has advised me that  these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1190,"content":"<p>Question No. 235 answered with Question No. 220.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[9356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will arrange for the processing of an application for a valid E112 card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[9373\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) in Dublin 15 will receive an appointment with the child and adolescent mental health services; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[9383\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for future residential care for psychiatric patients in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[9384\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a facility (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>As the delivery of healthcare infrastructure is a service matter your question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Properties","counter":1203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1204,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[9385\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100073#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a facility (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1205,"content":"<p>Management of the healthcare property portfolio is a service matter.

While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role. Autism is described as a spectrum disorder that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe. The first signs of autism may appear as developmental delay before the age of 3. Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity. <\/p><p><br \/>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for autism it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention. The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a financial support scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection for children with severe disabilities including children with autism who require continuous care and attention. <\/p><p><br \/>  Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization, agree that there is no link between the MMR or any other vaccine and autism. Vaccination is a safe and effective means of protecting children from serious and occasionally fatal illness. The safety of all medicines licensed in Ireland, including vaccines is monitored continuously by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB). Various data sources are used, including reports of suspected adverse reactions received from Ireland and worldwide, regular safety updates from the companies, the worldwide medical literature, data from epidemiological studies and information from independent researchers, as well as from other regulatory authorities around the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, current Government policy advocates a mainstreaming approach to the provision of services and supports for people with disabilities including those with autism, whereby people with  disabilities have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate supports and interventions to address individual needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE completed a review of the autism services provided by the health sector for both children and adults with autism in 2012. Its <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report,<\/i> reviews and identifies appropriate pathways of care for individuals with autism, given the existing diverse system of delivering services and varied approaches across the health sector. It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government&#8217;s mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs. It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate. It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People(0-18s) Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.<\/p><p>The National Review of Autism Services<i><\/i>Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":1251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1252,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[9490\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 261 of 29 November 2012, if he will provide details of the numbers on waiting lists in respect of assessment and treatment for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy with a breakdown by therapy and by duration on the waiting list and by area and by age category","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1253,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Treatment Programmes","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[9491\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100075#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount allocated and the outturn in respect of local schemes that is drugs schemes in each of the past five years with a breakdown by its constituent parts","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1256,"content":"<p>My Department administers a Drugs Initiative, which primarily funds community based drugs initiatives supported by Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces.

On the contrary the aim is to strengthen the programme by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure, by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services. <\/p><p> Since\u00a0becoming Minister with responsibility for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated\u00a0have been aimed at ensuring that into the\u00a0future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport\u00a0needs of all users.  To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport, NIRT Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. <\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community.  However, given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened. <\/p><p>  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established.  I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.<\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently.  I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022100076#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"}]
