The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees, when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue, in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.  It is relevant that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund also highlighted the growing deficit in the Fund and the prospect that it will, in the absence of measures to address the deficit, accelerate further in the future, driven primarily by pension costs.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2014 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children.  The Department does not have information on the number of children for whom child benefit is not being paid, as this would include cases where benefit has been refused but also cases where parents may not have claimed child benefit.<\/p><p>  Information held on the number of child benefit claims which have been disallowed as a result of failure to satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition is limited.

The average rate of return on each type of intervention varies depending on the intervention.\u00a0 In some types of interventions to tackle evasion and the black economy, such as enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective. <\/p><p>  It should also be recognised that Revenue operates within Government policy in relation to civil service numbers, has to prioritise its various tasks and must, for example, also deploy resources to encourage voluntary compliance by making it easier and less costly to comply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500061#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500061#WRA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[39350\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500061#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer, in each case, of increasing the standard rate cut-off point for PAYE to &euro;33,000, &euro;34,000, &euro;35,000, &euro;36,000, &euro;37,000, &euro;38,000, &euro;39,000 and &euro;40,000.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[39351\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500061#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer of decreasing the standard rate of PAYE by 1% and 2%, respectively.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[39353\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500061#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer of decreasing the higher rate of PAYE by 1% and 2%, respectively.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 21 together.<br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to apply different Income Tax rates or bands for PAYE sources of income alone.

In 2013 export volumes were largely unchanged but values increased by 3% to over &euro;520 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I also met with members of the IFA National Pigs and Pigmeat Committee as recently as last week to hear their views on recent developments.   <\/p><p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market.  At EU level the Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution. I have called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and\/or private storage aid.   <\/p><p>  Support is provided by my Department for the sector in a number of ways.  Firstly, as I announced in the budget yesterday, I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  In 2015, I am allocating &euro;37m for this scheme.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. <\/p><p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc will support Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The programme has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat. <\/p><p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.

The length of the back payment can vary, but the longest period of back payment normally occurs at this time of year, as the volume of approvals for new children on the programmes is at a peak.

They were published by the Health protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in 2012. Parts of this guidance have been updated in light of the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa. <br\/><br\/>The key elements to the guidelines include: <br\/><br\/>- the need for vigilance in considering the possibility of VHF in a person with a fever who has recently returned (within 21 days) from travel to an endemic area, <br\/><br\/>- the institution of appropriate infection control measures if a case is suspected, the rapid testing,<br\/><br\/>- rapid testing and diagnosis of the case, and<br\/><br\/>- the management of his\/her contacts.<br\/><br\/>Given appropriate infection control measures, onward transmission to others is extremely unlikely. <br\/><br\/>On 29 May 2013 a VHF education day was held for relevant professionals to launch guidance on Management of VHF produced by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC.  This education day concentrated particularly on providing a practical guide to the management of an imported VHF case, including ambulance transfer.<br\/><br\/>Following the announcement on 8 August 2014 a number of additional actions in relation to guidance, communications and transport were put in place, beyond those already in existence.  An urgent teleconference was convened between the Department of Health, the HPSC, HSE-Public Health, HSE-Emergency Preparedness and HSE-Communications to review the following areas:<br\/><br\/>- Travel advice - advice would issue from DOH advising against non-essential travel<br\/><br\/>- Posters in airports<br\/><br\/>- Repatriation of Irish citizens <br\/><br\/>In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s Port Health Group &ndash; a group tasked with providing guidance and advice in relation to measures in ports and airports.<br\/><br\/>On the day of the announcement, advice for travellers, including features of the disease, modes of transmission, and methods to prevention were posted on the HPSC website.  An extensive Ebola virus disease travel section was developed as a portal for those who would travel between West Africa and Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>The advice document <i>Advice for healthcare workers, including humanitarian aid workers, returning to or coming to Ireland following travel from an area affected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak<\/i>(most recent version 5 September 2014) was produced and posted on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.  <br\/><br\/>Advice for airport and port managers that had been developed was circulated to all relevant stakeholders.  This information was been posted on the website for the HPSC. The guidance document, <i>Update for Airport Managers and Airlines on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 22 August 2014 and the guidance document <i>Update for Port Managers and Ferry Companies on Ebola Virus Disease<\/i>was posted on 5 September 2014. <br\/><br\/>Posters (in English, French and Irish) - <i>Returning from West Africa? Important information about Ebola<\/i>&ndash; were printed and distributed to all Airports and the main designated Seaports.  They have been placed in prominent positions in full line of sight of all arriving passengers\/crews in the arrivals areas of these locations.  <br\/><br\/>Following the declaration of PHEIC, a modified  <i>EVD Risk Assessment for use by Ambulance Personnel<\/i>was developed from an existing document to ensure that transport of suspected EVD patients was placed on a clear and systematic footing.  This document provides highly specific guidance for ambulance personnel on the transfer of patients suspected as having EVD.  This algorithm allows for remote risk assessment of a patient suspected as having EVD arriving at one of the country&rsquo;s airports, by an expert physician from the National Isolation Unit in the Mater Hospital.  This guidance document lays out clear procedures whereby ambulance personnel would protect themselves and others from possible infection.  It stipulates the necessary isolation of a potentially infected person, personal protective equipment to be deployed by ambulance crews and the necessary urgent communication pathways required. <br\/><br\/>Beyond this initial contact, extensive guidance is also available for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers, to enable rapid identification of suspected Ebola patients, in other settings, and their urgent management.  There is also extensive guidance on the necessary steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients.<br\/><br\/>Healthcare staff in the NIU and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of EVD.  In addition, staff in the National Isolation Unit (NIU) have received specific training in the use of the appropriate PPE to be used in the management of a suspected EVD patient.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is represented on the EU Health Security Committee (HSC), which was set up to co-ordinate health threats at EU level, by officials from the Department of Health. The HSC chaired by the EU Commission and has membership from all 28 member states. Teleconferences are held regularly (14 since April) and the Department took part in the latest one held yesterday (14 October). Within Ireland, more than 20 meetings involving the Department of Health and the HSE have been held this year, with other meetings taking place across Government. These meetings include representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Defence, the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, and relevant agencies including the Defence Forces, and the Dublin Airport Authority.  A number of options for entry screening at EU airports for the ebola virus have been discussed at the Health Security Committee.  The consensus view, based on the scientific evidence, is that such screening is not an effective measure in attempting to control the spread of ebola.<br\/><br\/>There are currently no plans to introduce screening at Irish airports.  The Department will continue to monitor developments through the EU Health Security Committee and will review all measures as necessary.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is represented on the EU Health Security Committee, which was set up to co-ordinate health threats at EU level, by officials from the Department of Health.

Teleconferences have been held regularly on Ebola since April 2014, with the latest held on 14 October.  <br\/><br\/>A number of options for inward screening at airports for the Ebola were discussed. It remains the view, based on advices from the ECDC, that it is far more effective to support the implementation of exit screening in affected countries. However, it was noted that the provision of clear information to passengers from affected countries, particularly in relation to symptoms and how to access health care are important measures in preventing the spread of the disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500070#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500070#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[39345\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500070#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is no funding available to persons for assistance under the home care package (details supplied), the steps he will take to tackle this issue and sanction funding; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship and distress being caused to families as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500070#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500071#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[39397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500071#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if performance-related pay has been paid to any of his staff or staff in his Department for the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; if so, the number of staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am in no way personally involved in decisions about individual patients, members of staff or contractors. I have had no role in this matter which is one for the HSE and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene regardless of political pressure or lobbying. I hope you can understand and respect why that is. <\/p><p>  With regard to this case, I understand from the HSE that her indemnity has been suspended temporarily due to specific and serious concerns expressed by other clinical staff about patient safety.  When the HSE suspends an individual as precautionary measure subject to a review\/investigation, it does not do so lightly.  An overall competence and performance review is planned. I hope this will be done as expediently as possible.  <\/p><p>  I have been informed by the  HSE that there were 12 mothers-to-be, contracted for home births with Ms Canning at the time of her suspension. Three mothers have delivered of their babies. The remaining mothers-to-be are awaiting delivery of their babies. Of the remaining mothers, some have accepted the services of the SECM, some are still deciding, some have decided to access private maternity services and some have accessed the maternity hospitals for confinement.  I would suggest that if any of the remaining mothers-to-be known to Ms Canning and contracted to the HSE, have any concerns, that they should contact their designated midwife officer. <\/p><p>  On the broader issue, pregnancy is not a disease but a physiological condition and there is no reason why women with a normal pregnancy, should not have their baby delivered at home by a community midwife or in a midwife-led unit.

Universal access to a GP service for the entire population, without a financial barrier, is a key component of developed European health systems because GPs are best placed to appropriately manage a person&rsquo;s health.  As announced in Budget 2014, it was decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by initially providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014.<\/p><p>  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure which will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children that must currently pay to see a GP.  The service will be made available without any user fees or charges, nominal or otherwise.  It is important to state that medical cards are not being withdrawn from any person in order to fund this service.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million for this service is not savings made up from elsewhere in the health service.<\/p><p>  On 4th June 2014, a Framework Agreement was concluded between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO.  The Framework Agreement sets out a process for engagement concerning the GMS\/GP contract and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs.

A number of meetings have taken place and further meetings have been scheduled.<\/p><p>  When discussions on the contract&rsquo;s scope and content and fee structure have been concluded, the setting of the fee rates will be a matter for the Minister for Health, subject to the provisions of legislation and the Framework Agreement.

School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. <br\/><br\/>Because of increasing demographics my Department requires additional resources to simply maintain existing levels of service.

The re-entry provision allows a mature student, entering an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, having previously attended an approved course, to have their status reclassified.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the student grant scheme is to provide additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold or, in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.  Very significant numbers of third-level students move out of home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents while in full-time education.<\/p><p>  Confirmation that a student is living separately from their parents\/guardians is, of itself, not sufficient.<\/p><p>  The duration of the break in studies required for re-classification, such as that as an independent mature student, increased from one year to three years for the 2010\/11 academic year. Under previous schemes students could be re-classified as a mature students following a break of only one year. However, this was being used in some cases as a &quot;gap year&quot; by students whose parents' income was too high to qualify for a grant, to return after a year and resume their studies at postgraduate level qualifying for support based on their own, rather than their parents', income.

At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. <br\/><br\/>  The national average class size at primary level is 24.8 pupils.  However, with over 21,100 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. <br\/><br\/>  The school referred to by the Deputy has 4 classroom teachers this school year based on an enrolment of 102 pupils on 30th September 2013.  This facilitates an average class size of 25 pupils per class. <br\/><br\/>  Schools with significantly increasing enrolments are catered for within the staffing arrangements by being allocated teachers on the basis of their current pupil numbers rather than on a previous year basis which is the case for the majority of schools.  The staffing appeals process has been extended to include a new criterion which helps those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places, which assists the response to demographic growth within their area, and as a result are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.<br\/><br\/>  The school referred to has not applied for additional teaching staff under either of these measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500081#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500082#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[39505\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500082#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the percentage of leaving certificate students doing higher level subjects by subject in the country, in particular the number doing higher level maths; the progress and increased pick up by students doing honours maths; the steps she will take to increase that number; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>In the 2014 Leaving Certificate, 27.3% of Mathematics candidates opted to sit for the Higher Level Mathematics Paper.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea.<br\/><br\/>As the Department with policy responsibility for nuclear related matters, my Department monitors the UK nuclear sector on an on-going basis and convenes regular meetings with UK counterparts to discuss general policy issues and raise matters of interest or concern, where appropriate. I should point out that Ireland is a recognised stakeholder in all UK nuclear consultations. The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Office of Radiological Protection (formerly the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland), which operates under the aegis of my Department, carries out an environmental radioactivity monitoring programme throughout Ireland and has regularly monitored levels of radioactivity in the Irish environment since 1982.<br\/><br\/>In November 2012, my Department published a summary of a commissioned report prepared by an independent team of international experts which assessed the probable risks to Ireland from incidents at the Sellafield nuclear site. The experts quantified the likelihood of an incident occurring at Sellafield resulting in the release of radioactive material and found that such an incident would give rise to &ldquo;no observable health effects in Ireland&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has been involved in the consultation process on the new build nuclear programme in the UK, which was announced in a 2009 draft Energy National Policy Statement by the UK authorities, and we have written twice at Ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea from the new build programme. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at Ministerial level has been supported and informed by continued and regular dialogue at official level, where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with their UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of these plans. <br\/><br\/>Following notification in early 2012 of the proposed development at Hinkley Point, my Department requested the RPII to complete an assessment of the potential radiological impacts on Ireland from the programme of new nuclear power plants in the UK, including the plant at Hinkley Point. This assessment considered both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants. The report concluded that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants will have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment. However, regardless of the radiological impact, any accident at the proposed nuclear power plants leading to an increase of radioactivity levels in Ireland would have a socio-economic impact on Ireland. The report is available on the EPA website at .<br\/><br\/>Under the EURATOM Treaty, the UK i s required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not be likely to result in radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. In that context, a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that under normal operating conditions, the discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents are not likely to cause an exposure of the population in another Member State that is significant from the point of view of health.<br\/><br\/>Regarding nuclear safety and security, I should also point out that Ireland works with other States through our membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) where these issues are regularly discussed and where access to up-to-date information in relation to nuclear issues is available. Engagement with the IAEA also enables the development of our policy in these areas to benefit from the experiences of other States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500083#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Remit","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500083#WRX01000"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[39320\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500083#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the protocol between Irish Water and local authorities, in view of the fact that construction bonds to cover costs of public foul water services will expire on the taking in charge of estates by local authorities, and where Irish Water will not have completed the taking of charge of public foul services.","asker":"1052","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[39435\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500083#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the contingencies that are in place should a local authority decide to take an unfinished estate in charge, effectively relinquishing any bond in force in respect of the estate, and subsequently water infrastructure problems are identified; in such a case if Irish Water will pay to alleviate the deficiencies; if the first fix free policy will apply in these cases if leaks are discovered on residents' side of the property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 146 together.<\/p><p>  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, sets out the process by which local authorities can take in charge housing estates.

Pension schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Authority is the national statutory regulatory authority in Ireland.\u00a0 There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a\u00a0 scheme such as the IASS.<\/p><p>  In their discussions with the deferred members, the Expert Panel explained that the process was an industrial relations process and that responsibility\u00a0for dealing with the deferred members of the scheme rested with the IASS Trustee through engagement with the employers.\u00a0 Nothwithstanding that strict legal position, the Panel\u00a0recommended, inter alia, that the IASS Trustee\u00a0engage with the employers on ways to alleviate as much of the impact of the Trustee proposal as is possible whilst also recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals for actice and deferred members.\u00a0 As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members and which goes a long way towards mitigating the benefit cuts proposed by the IASS Trustee.<\/p><p>  I also understand that discussions are ongoing between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Social Protection in relation to access of\u00a0former employees, in particular deferred pensioners and pensioners, to the industrial relations machinery of the State.<\/p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.\u00a0 These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.\u00a0 Each member will also shortly receive a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.\u00a0 All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014. \u00a0The target date for implementation\u00a0of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.<\/p><p>  Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years\u00a0in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding\u00a0problems. \u00a0A set of clear proposals\u00a0has now been put forward which offer\u00a0the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme\u00a0and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.\u00a0 I would urge all parties to accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500089#WRDD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500090#WREE00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Applications","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500090#WREE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[39356\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101500090#WREE00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive compensation under the turf cutting scheme; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>An application for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been received by my Department from the individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.
