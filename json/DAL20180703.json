Seven years on, we have record levels of waiting times and waiting lists.  Some 718,000 people, an extraordinary number, are on hospital waiting lists as of May of this year.  Some 512,000 of these are on an outpatient waiting list, a record high which means that many will wait for years for an operation or procedure.  For example, 66,768 people are waiting for an ear, nose and throat, ENT, consultant, with nearly 30,000 of those waiting more than a year and 17,000 waiting more than 18 months for access to ENT services.  Some 62,000 people are on outpatient waiting list to see an orthopaedic consultant.  Some 20,000 have been waiting more than a year and 11,000 more than 18 months.  Some 41,000 are on the ophthalmology list, 41,000 for dermatology, and 30,000 are on a waiting list to see a gynaecology consultant.  Some 20,000 are on a cardiology list, 20,000 are on a neurology list, and so on.  The 18 month waiting list is getting longer despite the fact that the now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, brought that in.  He widened the goalposts in a cynical move at the time.  Even the target to eradicate that has been missed.<\/p>  <p>  Children are hardest hit, waiting far too long for far too many operations, outpatient appointments, and access to mental healthcare.  Child and adolescent waiting lists are unacceptable, and speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy all have scandalous waiting lists.  Some 50,000 children are waiting for an outpatient consultation and appointment.  Some 10,000 children have been waiting more than 18 months to see a consultant.  In excess of 4,500 children are waiting for an assessment of need under the Disability Act.  Some 2,691 are on children and adolescent mental health waiting lists, with close to 400 waiting more than a year.  That is appalling.  An extraordinary figure of 6,000 have been waiting for a primary care psychological appointment.  The elderly are no better, with 6,500 waiting for home care and help access.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Sl&aacute;intecare programme was launched with great fanfare.  An executive director was to be appointed, yet 14 months on, nothing has happened with regard to that.  No executive director has been appointed.  Given those lamentable figures and appalling waiting times for people, why is there inaction and a delay in appointing an executive director to implement the Sl&aacute;intecare programme?  Why has it taken 14 months after the launch of the programme by the Oireachtas and the committee for the Government to do anything about its implementation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300003#A00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1530622800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>With regard to the Deputy's last question, I am told that an executive director is about to be appointed after a long recruitment process.  This is a new departure.  It has taken time to get it right.  We are focused on trying to get the right person and putting the right structures around that person to make sure that an executive director can deliver on the potential and ambition of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p>  <p>  Waiting times are too long.<\/p><p>That is why reducing waiting times for patients for hospital operations and procedures continues to be a key priority for the Government.  A total of &euro;50 million was provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in 2018 to secure treatments for patients.  On 12 April, the Minister for Health published a joint action plan between the HSE and the NTPF to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment.  Under the action plan, the number of patients waiting longer than nine months will fall by 10,000.  The NTPF commits to offer treatment to all suitable clinical patients waiting more than nine months for treatment in a number of high-volume specialties, including cataract, hip and knee replacements, tonsils and scopes.  The overall number of patients waiting for hospital operations and procedures is targeted to fall below 70,000 by the end of the year.  Under the action plan the NTPF will work with both public and private hospitals to access treatment for those patients.<\/p> <p> The May waiting list figures show that 78,500 patients were waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure, which is down marginally by 800 on the previous year, but down by almost 7,200 when comparing the year-on-year figures.  The number of patients waiting longer than nine months for an inpatient or day procedure is now down 5,800 in comparison with May 2017.  I am not saying that makes it acceptable - it is far from it - but what I am saying is that we are making some progress.  Tackling the situation will require a combination of more staff, which is happening, more hospital beds, which is happening, and more reform consistent with the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which is supported by all parties in this House.  Very soon we will have a director to take charge of Sl&aacute;intecare and over time we will see the continued commitment of the Government to bring down waiting lists across the multiple sectors the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300003#A00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530623100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I must point out that it was seven years ago that the Government promised universal access to services, and we are now in a far worse position.  It was the Government that got rid of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2012.  That is directly attributable to an escalation in waiting times and waiting lists.  It has only been reinstated because of the confidence and supply agreement and because of Fianna F&aacute;il insisting that the National Treatment Purchase Fund would be reintroduced.  There was huge resistance to that at the time.  That is the only thing the Government can latch on to now to say it is beginning to have an impact, but only on the inpatient waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  All of my figures relate to the outpatient waiting list in terms of gynaecology, ENT, orthopaedics and ophthalmology, and in particular children waiting more than 18 months to see a consultant.  There is no impact on the outpatient waiting list whatsoever.  The marginal improvement on the inpatient waiting list is due to the extra &euro;50 million allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, at our insistence, in the previous budget.  Barring that, the fact is that 14 months on, there is no progress with Sl&aacute;intecare.  The T&aacute;naiste should not expect us to believe that it is because we took our time to get somebody.  That speaks to a lack of urgency around health and health services and about changing the figures for the elderly, children and people in general, so that elderly people do not have to travel to the North for a cataract operation or come to our offices seeking to work out how to get there.

Those children live in agony and are unable to live a full life.  Their parents are frustrated and exhausted from battling the system.  They are worn out fighting for access for their children to vital medical treatment and life-changing surgery, which is a battle they should not have to fight.  Those who watched the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme entitled \"Living on the List\" did so in horror and grief.  It provided a harrowing insight into the daily struggles faced by these children and their families.  The T&aacute;naiste may recall that in the aftermath of the programme, the Minister for Health offered apologies and made promises.  Those promises have been broken for 88 children, whose days from when they get up until they go to bed are filled with extreme pain and discomfort.  I cannot imagine what it must be like for a child to endure that suffering.  It is hard to imagine what it is like for the families of those children to watch as the phoney war, which we have seen again this afternoon between the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is played out.

We need a sunny day fund because the current heatwave and the warnings from Irish Water about water shortages have yet again exposed the completely decrepit state of Ireland's water infrastructure and the disastrous consequences of decades of underinvestment by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  In particular, the current crisis has been exacerbated by the decisions from 2010 onwards, first by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and subsequently continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to cut the capital investment programme for fixing the water infrastructure by &euro;50 million per year.  We have now reached the point that 49% of water is lost through leaks from the mains infrastructure, rather than household wastage.  It is particularly infuriating that spokespersons for the parties that imposed the cuts and austerity on the water investment programme have the cheek to blame householders for the problem when they know that the expert commission the Government set up to look into water usage in this country concluded categorically that there was no evidence of excessive household wastage and that household usage in Ireland is lower than that of Great Britain, which has water charges.  I repeat that usage here is lower than in Britain.  That is what the Government's expert commission concluded.  We use 110 litres per day per house while in Great Britain, which has water charges, average household usage is 140 litres per day.  Why do Government spokespersons and representatives of parties that slashed the investment programme for water infrastructure persist in blaming householders?  The reality is that householders are reaping the bitter fruits of the Government's decision to cut investment in fixing our decrepit and broken water infrastructure.  The evidence is still there.  There has been a leak on Kildare Street for two weeks.  The T&aacute;naiste should go outside and take a look at it.  On Friday, I managed to have a case featured on national radio involving one street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where residents reported water leakage and water shortages in January.  Irish Water did not arrive to look at the problem until June and has said it cannot fix it until August.<\/p><p>That is the consequence - leakage of 700 million litres a day, which is wasted because the Government has failed to invest in fixing our broken water infrastructure.

It has a capital investment programme which is secure, thanks to the political agreement in this House.  Therefore, for the first time, we have a proper, coherent, organised and funded plan to fix Ireland's water infrastructure once and for all.

If established in law, this committee would examine case law judgments, issues arising from our membership of the EU and OECD, the all-too-common controversies about the use of tax loopholes and other international tax developments.<\/p><p>The key aim of the Bill is to tackle once and for all the emerging international view of Ireland as a tax haven.<\/p><p>As a country, we are drinking in the last chance saloon with regard to how we participate in international tax justice and progress.  This is what this vital tax infrastructure proposes to address.   The new body would also be charged with commissioning research and analysis, and advising the Minister.  It would promote tax equity, seek to protect the revenues of the State and facilitate enterprise, while simplifying the operation of the law and enhancing compliance.  It would allow the State to play catch-up with many of the legal and accounting tax advisory firms, which are always at least three steps ahead of Revenue in planning schemes, some of which involve extremely aggressive tax planning and significant reductions in tax income to the State.<\/p> <p> Recent international studies can no longer be ignored or downplayed by the Government.  As the recent Coffey report shows, Ireland has made significant progress in the area of tax.  However, the growing view of Ireland as a tax haven, as argued in recent academic studies, has to be addressed definitively.  In the Labour Party's two most recent alternative budgets, I outlined concerns, since echoed in a recent report of the Committee of Public Accounts on corporation tax, about the need for reform and oversight.  One of the first tasks of the proposed commission would be to examine the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is not acceptable, in this day and age, that the banks which taxpayers bailed out at great sacrifice should effectively have a tax holiday with relief from all corporation tax for up to 20 years.  I have raised in the D&aacute;il in recent years nearly all of the key issues flagged in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, including the use of tax losses, particularly by the banks but also by the construction industry and property developers, and the high and growing cost of the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit, which is many millions more than what it was meant to be when introduced by the Minister.<\/p> <p> It is clear that we still have some way to go on tax transparency and justice.  A standing commission on taxation would be tasked with continuously monitoring how our tax laws are being used to examine loopholes, reliefs and avoidance structures on a rolling basis.  Many of the tax structures we still have made a significant contribution to the last crash.  If we are to avoid stormy water in future, we need to have infrastructure which examines whether the cost to taxpayers of some of the schemes is justifiable and whether these schemes are fair and equitable.  I firmly believe that we need a commission to examine matters such as this, which should be closely and continuously monitored.  Such a body would be ideally suited to this task.<\/p> <p> I have spoken previously about having a minimum effective corporate tax rate to ensure profitable companies in Ireland cannot use accounting tricks and tax losses from the property crash to avoid paying their fair share.  Other European Union countries such as Italy, France and Germany are developing individual responses to multi-billion companies which show in their accounts that they effectively pay little or no tax in Ireland, particularly in digital taxation.

This small Bill is designed to amend the regulations relating to the establishment of co-operative societies to make the process of registering a co-operative much easier.  It will do this in a number of ways.  It reduces the membership criteria from seven members to three, in line with the regulations in place in most of Europe.  It allows for electronic filing and registration, a process available to other types of companies, and allows for audit exemptions, which are also available to other types of companies but not to co-operative societies.  These small measures will level the playing field and make the establishment of co-operatives much easier.  They will lay the basis for us, as a society, to develop this type of economic activity in a way that is much more in line with what takes place in the rest of Europe and the world.<\/p><p>The economic turmoil of the past decade and the insecurity of the market have had devastating effects on jobs and vital services.  Against that backdrop, it is no coincidence that Europe has experienced significant growth in co-operatives aimed at salvaging jobs and saving local services.  Similar growth has not occurred in Ireland, which is completely out of kilter with the rest of Europe in this regard.  This legislation can be part of Ireland joining the co-operative movement that already exists.  It is a resilient, democratic movement which is generally based on values of providing good jobs and services that are beneficial to communities.  These companies are much more likely to reinvest their profits in training and education than bend to shareholder demands.  They are far less likely to contribute to environmental damage in their locality.  They are also incredibly sustainable, currently providing 100 million jobs around the world.<\/p><p>Research in economies such as Scotland reveals that the companies based on the co-operative model are much more likely to survive in the first five years than other start-ups, with a 97% survival rate for the first 12 months.  The 573 co-operatives in Scotland had a turnover of &pound;2.4 billion last year based on a membership of 1.2 million, while the UK as a whole had 7,226 independent co-operatives, extending from the well-known John Lewis chain, with a &pound;10 billion turnover, to local cr&egrave;che providers.  We believe this model can be replicated in local communities, particularly rural communities, and deliver substantial benefits to everybody.  They are a win-win solution.<\/p><p>We have the Dublin Food Co-op, which is run by its members and provides healthy, fair trade, cruelty-free and environmentally friendly produce, for which there is a big market.  We have the incredibly successful Belfast Cleaning Company, a worker-owned and managed company that has been operating successfully on a cross-community basis in Belfast for the past five years.  The Magpie Recycling Co-operative in Brighton began with three volunteers collecting cans and glass in their locality and expanded into a collective, recycling materials such as old furniture from the curbside to provide a service to more than 2,000 households and a workshop to upcycle the waste.  There is no shortage of examples.  We believe that this is a win-win model and the Bill provides a simple mechanism that will make the process of establishing co-operatives easier.  We will be supportive of any community groups or local workers' groups that want to adapt the model and we will work with pioneers in organisations such as Trademark, which operates out of Northern Ireland, who can assist in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1530629400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530629400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01100","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530629400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530629400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530629400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530629400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Employment Equality Act 1998 (section 12) (Reservation of vocational training places) Order: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1530629400,"counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1530629400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:Employment Equality Act 1998 (section 12) (Reservation of vocational training places) Order 2018,a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 26th June, 2018, be referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 12th July, 2018, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300017#P01700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530629400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Air Services Agreements: Referral to Select Committee","time":1530630000,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution the terms of:<br \/><br \/>(i) the Air Services Agreement between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of Ireland;

The report builds on the conclusions of the Citizens' Assembly following two weekends of deliberation on the energy, transport and agriculture sectors, international best practice and existing national policies and activities.  A total of 17 recommendations are detailed in the report.  This is comprised of 13 recommendations reached by majority vote from the Citizens' Assembly ballot paper voting and four ancillary recommendations compiled from further submissions made by members via a member reflective exercise response facility for the assembly.  The terms of reference of the special committee take into account the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and the committee will play an important role in informing the preparation of Ireland's draft national energy and climate plan, which the Department is currently preparing.  The terms of reference also include the national development plan.  The Government means to do mean business when it comes to taking strong action on climate change.  I was very pleased recently to launch the climate action priority of Project Ireland 2040 with An Taoiseach and a number of my Cabinet colleagues.  Over the next decade we will spend &euro;22 billion on climate-focused investments.  That represents a huge leap forward in our approach, both in the scale of our ambition and the funding we are making available as a Government to meet the challenges.  In fact, &euro;1 in every &euro;5 to be spent by the State and State companies in capital investment over the next decade will have a climate-related focus.  That is not just significant on a European scale but on a global scale.<\/p>  <p>  We also expect to invest &euro;4,000 million in energy efficiency upgrades of buildings and within the next 200 months, dirty fossil fuels will be taken out of our heating systems, including homes.  That will be an achievement of global significance given the fact that 37% of homes are in rural areas.  We will have dirty fossil fuels taken out of electricity generation by 2030.  Over the next decade our ambition is to increase production of electricity from renewable sources to 55% by 2030, which would be a phenomenal feat, in light of the fact that we have such an isolated electricity grid.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of regulatory measures, the national development plan commits the Government to no new non-zero emission cars to be sold in Ireland post 2030.  In effect, there will be a ban on tailpipes on new cars from 2030.  We will become the first EU country to do so.  It is intended that no NCT certificate will be issued for non-zero emission cars post-2045.  That is one of the most ambitious commitments on zero emissions on passenger cars in the entire EU.  There will also be a transition to a low emission urban bus fleet, including electric buses, with no diesel-only buses purchased from 1 July 2019.  The low-carbon, climate resilient transition ahead will require a societal transformation.<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly demonstrates that individual citizens can produce very clear recommendations when provided with an opportunity to reflect and consider in detail a specific societal change.  It also underlines for me that Ireland will not achieve its climate objectives through Government action alone and engagement with wider society on an ongoing basis will be vital.  Last Saturday week, I hosted the first regional gathering under the national dialogue on climate action to involve individual citizens and communities in the process of shaping Ireland's low-carbon transition.  These meetings are the first step of engagement with communities across the country.  The establishment by the joint Houses of this special committee is an important milestone for the Oireachtas.  I and my officials look forward to working with the committee on its work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300018#Q00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for allowing me a moment of his speaking time.  As the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I wish to put on the record of this House how important I view the establishment of this special committee.  As one who served on the Special Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I can attest to the value of such a move.  The establishment of this committee will give a focus to the climate change issue that it simply cannot get in the midst of a Department's or a committee's consideration of other matters.  To put it very simply; climate change has not got the attention or action it deserves because the Department, and my committee, must consider a whole range of other subjects within our remit.  Important matters such as public service broadcasting, the media landscape in general, broadband and a myriad of other issues take up time that we could otherwise devote to climate action.  The fact that we are going to miss our 2020 targets by a considerable margin illustrates the point that we have not paid sufficient attention to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  My statement today is not to criticise the Minister, his Department or my committee, rather the contrary, we need to put substantial resources into developing a proper and effective policy on climate change.  It is my view that the establishment of this committee to consider the report of the Citizens' Assembly and ancillary matters is a very positive step in developing such a policy in the short term.  Having recently spoken to the Taoiseach on the issue I can assure the House of his and Fine Gael's complete support in the work this committee will do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300018#Q00800","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Like others, Fianna F&aacute;il wholeheartedly supports the establishment of a special Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We welcome the recent establishment of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change.  Without a shadow of a doubt, climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity on a global scale and it is vital that Ireland plays a strong role in addressing it.<\/p>  <p>  This Government and its predecessor have dismal records on climate change and that is reflected in the fact that Ireland will miss all of its 2020 targets.  I appeal to the Minister in the first instance to accept where we are at and stop this continuous bluff and bluster about what is going to happen in 2030, 2045 and 2050.  There are a couple of harsh realities he must face.  He referred to the diesel bus fleet from now on.  Just last year, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, ordered 110 new dirty diesel buses at a time when everybody was talking about our inability to meet the 2020 targets.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, knows better than any how the electoral cycle works and he knows scant regard is paid to what happens in 2030, 2040 or 2050.  He must be able to convince his colleagues in government that we have a crisis.  The responsibility does not all lie at the door of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, nor should it.  The Minister does not have to defend the indefensible, nor should he.  If he takes a lead role at the Cabinet table he will have my support and that of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The Minister must bang the table and demand that there is an acceptance that we are laggards rather than come in here and tell us what he is hoping to achieve in terms of being a world leader in electric vehicles by 2045 when we have failed abysmally with the targets we have set.  We are way behind and that is appalling.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister made an official announcement yesterday about passenger vehicles on toll plazas receiving a cut of approximately 50%, for most cars except for hybrid vehicles.  The reality is that people who have had hybrid vehicles and have moved to electric vehicles now want to move back because the network of charging units is not adequate to support their continued driving of electric vehicles.  There is so much more to be done.  Rather than saying what we will do in 2045 the Minister should set a target for the next two to three years that falls within the cycle of this or perhaps the next Government rather than talking too far ahead and being absolved from all responsibility.  The Minister knows better than I that we are required to reduce our carbon emissions by 20% relative to 2005 levels.  We are on track for a 1% reduction, which will give rise to an estimated fine of approximately &euro;600 million.  From 2020, on the renewable energy side we are required to source 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources.  We currently source approximately 9.1% of our energy requirements from renewable sources.  The estimated fine in that regard depending on the cost of the credits will be somewhere between &euro;115 million and &euro;600 million.<\/p><p>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, stated that the Taoiseach is committed to this matter.  When elected, the Taoiseach made it clear that this was one of the biggest issues for the Government and that he was going to focus almost exclusively on it in the wake of budget 2018.  That statement was laughable because he and the Government did virtually nothing in that budget to try to begin a pathway towards meeting our 2020 targets to the greatest extent possible.  I am somewhat dejected because the notion is now taking hold in the Government that we have missed the 2020 targets but, what the hell, there are 2030 and 2050 targets.  The Government does not accept the possibility of very significant fines but states that such fines will depend on the cost of the carbon credits and should not be overestimated.  This should not be about the cost of carbon credits or what we can get away with.  Rather, it should be about setting a standard that a small island such as ours which has come through a tough time can reach.  We are resilient and showed our capacity to implement very difficult measures over a relatively short period in 2009 and 2010.  The decisions taken were not politically advantageous for my party but the Government may benefit from the very significant economic changes that were made to get the country back on track.  The challenge for the Government is similarly to take very difficult decisions on climate change to get our targets in line as quickly as possible and ensure we play our part in Europe rather than picking one item, hanging our hook on it and saying we are world leaders.  In terms of emissions, energy generation and this entire issue, we are almost the worst in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300018#Q00900","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530630600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Absolutely not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300019#R00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>We are the second worst.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300019#R00300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We aim to increase production of electricity from renewable sources to 55%.

However, this House is also a citizens' assembly.  It is directly elected and paid for by the people of this State and it is answerable to them.  These issues should be tackled head on in the Oireachtas and we should make the decisions to put us on the right path to counter climate change.  The Citizens' Assembly recommended that the State take leadership on this issue but the State and the Oireachtas have not done so sufficiently.  Everyone will play their part and be involved if given the means to so do.  Communities need to be involved and, most importantly, respected in the transition ahead.  However, it starts with leadership by the Government and the Oireachtas and seeing beyond the election cycle referred to by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot hide that the State is in a shameful position in terms of climate action.  Emissions are spiralling and we are the second worst in the European Union in terms of climate change measures.  We will miss our 2020 targets and face fines of hundreds of millions of euro as a result.  The shame on the State in regard to climate change is doubled because we have some of the best renewable resources in Europe.  Not only will we not meet our emissions targets but Ireland will only achieve a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 rather than the 20% reduction target which we should have tried to exceed.  Our emissions are increasing.  The only renewable energy we have developed has been from onshore wind and, rather than having community involvement in that, the opposite has been the case.  Many of the key participants in the industries involved in directly combatting climate change have not shown the vision needed for the future but rather have been stagnant and lacked imagination and will.  There has been a lack of political will on behalf of the Government and the Oireachtas and a lack of vision by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is important for senior and other civil servants to wake up on this issue.  It will be up to the Oireachtas committee to address issues directly and make recommendations which will lead to solutions and change.<\/p>  <p>  There is much discussion of the targets but those targets are being missed badly.  We must discuss solutions to protect our environment, create security of energy and see climate action not as a burden but rather an opportunity to create long-term jobs and new industries, particularly in rural Ireland.  The committee must be focused on solutions such as making homes more energy efficient and changing our sources of power for electricity, heat and transport.  That is very important.  There are many aspects to addressing this issue.  It is not a case of simply putting obligations on citizens and asking them to take the burden without any alternative.  Our first step and policy must be to offer alternatives to people, industry and communities.  That will require political leadership and a major shake-up of civil servants, semi-State companies, private companies etc.  We must offer people alternatives in public transport, energy and efficiency and have specific targets for each industry to help develop alternative sources of energy.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to addressing the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, as I stated, this House is a citizens' assembly.  I have been Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on the environment for seven and a half years and I dealt with the Minister's predecessor in the previous D&aacute;il on this matter.  I do not wish to criticise anyone but one of the most frustrating things for me over the past seven and a half years has been all the talk on this issue without the necessary action.  I acknowledge that the State has gone through a very traumatic period economically and so on and had to be picked up off the floor.  However, that has been done but we have not moved towards a new modern green economy.<\/p>  <p>  We need to create jobs in different types of industries and have different renewable sources of energy.  Some people wish to make the switch and immediately turn off all our current energy sources.  I wish for that to happen but I know, as does every worker and person on the street, that it cannot unless alternatives are in place.  I appeal for the Oireachtas, the committee, the Minister and the Department to set about putting realistic alternatives in place in terms of wind, biogas, solar, hydro, offshore wind and wave power.  We have the resources and experts who have considered the matter have told us that we need to use them.  We cannot keep lagging behind the rest of Europe and not only because of the shame of completely missing our targets.  I did not think it could get any worse than when the Minister last year told me and others that we would only achieve a 4% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions.  However, three weeks ago in answer to a question of mine he announced that we will now only achieve a 1% reduction, which is absolutely disgraceful.  We all have a responsibility.  We must change our approach and create a major impetus to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and remove the shame of being one of the dirty countries in Europe when we should be a green food-producing island which produces green energy to meet its needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300019#R00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1530630600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The Labour Party welcomes the establishment of the select committee.  I look forward to being a member of it.  I wish to address briefly the potential for carbon capture and storage.  I understand a feasibility study is under way in that regard.  I ask the Minister to indicate where Ireland stands in regard to the potential for carbon capture and storage.  I specifically put that on the agenda because it should be discussed within the remit of the committee.<\/p><p> I understand the European Union is looking for large-scale carbon capture and storage, CCS, projects, for which significant funding is available.  That represents a potentially good opportunity for Ireland and will help to decarbonise electricity generation on our island.  It could act as a potential for further foreign direct investment into Ireland on the basis that many multinational companies are now considering opportunities for decarbonisation and we have to be practical and pragmatic about those opportunities if they come before us.  Could the Minister, in his response, give us some indication as to where stands the feasibility study on carbon capture and storage?  I tabled a specific parliamentary question to him on that issue.  I met Ervia yesterday, which is very interested in this space.  As we know, Ervia is our own company.  It has a big interest in this area and it is something on which we should engage with it.<\/p> <p> I share the sentiments of other speakers.  We have a massive opportunity on this island to send a message globally on meeting targets and realising opportunities.  We are a small, innovative island and the networks created as between industry and academia in terms of scientific research and the person to person and business to business networks probably allows for people to come together more easily than in other parts of the European Union.  That represents an opportunity for us.<\/p> <p> I am hopeful we could also have regard to the work of Science Foundation Ireland on the previous investment by the taxpayer in the marine renewable energy space.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, we launched the MaREI centre in Cork.  There was a significant investment by the taxpayer in the area of marine renewable energy.  We need to kick the tyres, so to speak, in terms of where that entity currently stands.  It is one of the few entities looking specifically at marine renewable energy and as an island nation, and an Atlantic nation, we have to start leveraging more opportunities to make greater investments to ensure our energy mix moves further into the renewable space.  I believe the marine renewable sector represents a major opportunity in that regard.<\/p> <p> I look forward to working as part of the committee.  I am hopeful it will not be just a talking shop.  As a Parliament we have an opportunity through this committee, working collaboratively across parties, to try to make some serious changes in the direction this island goes in its responsibilities regarding climate change.  We are all green now.  Nobody has ownership of green issues.  There are existential issues facing us now, as well as future generations, and we all need to collaborate politically in that space for action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300019#R00900","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530631200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett, who is sharing with Deputy Paul Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300020#S00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530631200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>We will have two and a half minutes each.<\/p>  <p>  While we are happy to participate in this special committee, I have to say that we need more than special committees if we are to do something about Ireland's disastrous failure to address the issue of climate change and play its part in contributing to the reduction in CO2 emissions.  We have many targets and aspirations that are simply not being matched by reality.  In the past two years, carbon emissions in this country went up by 7%, not down.  We are facing fines of &euro;440 million for failing to meet our emission reduction targets in two years' time.  Even on issues like the Heritage Bill that Members will discuss tonight, the Government is supporting moves to allow greater and earlier cutting of hedgerows when we need more forestry, hedgerows and scrub to act as carbon sinks and to reduce carbon emissions.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no sign of radical action in these areas.  The Citizens' Assembly made all the right recommendations, in particular a pet issue of mine which I have raised about 60 times since 2011, namely, the need to do something about our pathetic levels of forest cover.  We have some of the lowest in Europe, at 11%, even though we have the most favourable conditions in Europe bar none for growing trees but we do not do anything about it.  In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, says there is evidence of deforestation in Ireland because we are kowtowing to certain lobbies in agriculture who see forestry as a threat to them when they should not.<\/p>  <p>  If we invested in and supported areas like agroforestry, afforestation could complement Irish agriculture.  We need radical action in terms of shifting towards public transport use.  That would mean much more investment in that area, reducing fares dramatically, if we are serious about getting people out of their cars, and in many other areas.  We need the rhetoric to be matched with genuinely radical action by the Government.  There is not much sign of that but let us hope this committee can go some way towards pushing the Government on in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Bill, which is being discussed in committee to stop further extraction of fossil fuels here.

What struck me strongest was the 98% who said that climate change should be put centre stage in policy making.  That cannot be done by tinkering around the edges.  It cannot be done with some electric cars or with some consumption charges.  It has to be done with a radical break in terms of how our society is organised in the areas of energy, agriculture and in transport centrally.<\/p>  <p>  How radical a break is needed is reflected in the report that came out last week from the Climate Action Network that is utterly damning in terms of the approach of the Government.  It has all the EU countries listed and grouped into the good, the bad and the ugly.  Estonia, Ireland and Poland rank lowest in the ugly category because of their stiff opposition to climate action nationally and in the European Union.  They are ranked second lowest in the EU, confirming what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said - incredibly, in Paris when the Paris Agreement was being signed - that climate change is not a priority for Ireland.  Unfortunately, that remains the case.<\/p>  <p>  On energy, we currently have five times as many known fossil fuels as can be burned without the temperature rising above 2o Celsius.  The idea that we should be issuing any more exploration licences is utterly mad and, therefore, the Government should drop its opposition to the Bill proposing that fossil fuels be kept in the ground sponsored by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and the Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance.  <\/p>  <p>  Only last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, spoke about the need for an increase in drilling and the realisation of our oil and gas potential.  We need there to be an end to the use of fossil fuels and a radical shift to renewable energies.  <\/p>  <p>  On transport, the push for the shift to electric cars is not the answer.  I am for electric cars.  They are better than petrol cars but the issue is the mode of transport, the way that people move from place to place.  Massive investment in public transport is required to make it more accessible, realistic, achievable and affordable for people to use as a mode of travel.  The example of Estonia is worth considering.  It now has free public transport across the country.  We estimated in our last budget proposal that it would take &euro;500 million to halve the cost of public transport.  <\/p>  <p>  On the point about agriculture, Ireland is unusual in that agriculture, as opposed to transport, is the number one emitter in this regard.  Having 6.7 million cows in Ireland currently using over 150 l of water each is not a sustainable model of organising agriculture and we need a break from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300020#S00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1530631200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>They are not all cows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300020#S00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1530631200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>That is for sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300020#S00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530631200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>We have to live down there too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300020#S00700","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1530631800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The word I would use about Ireland is \"disconnect\".  There is a perception that climate change has nothing to do with us, we did not cause it and really we are not affected by it.  However, we have scientific evidence that climate change is real.  It is happening, humans are responsible and we are all affected.  Some are affected more than others, as the Minister knows - crucially, those who are in what is known as the global south or developing world.  Those who have done the least damage to the environment are most affected by the decisions we make in the so-called developed world.  Our record has been very poor.  Although Ireland did not have massive industries such as the coal industry, we need to accept the reality that we could and should be doing more.<\/p>  <p>  We have a drought warning, the first in many years.  The drought we are experiencing today is a reality for millions in the developing world every single day.  Their crops and productivity are not for profit but are a matter of life and death, of survival.  Our relationship to climate change and way of tackling it seem to involve renegotiating targets, finding loopholes to avoid targets, and avoiding fines.  We consider that a win because we are valuing profit over sustainability.  Climate change is a massive threat.  Our generation cannot understand how previous generations tolerated slavery for so long.  Later generations will be at a loss to understand why we did not do more about climate change.  Deputy Thomas Pringle's Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill will be before the House on Report Stage next week.  It is long overdue.  As Iceland harnessed its volcanic geology for energy, surely we can do more, even for purely economic reasons.  Our reliance on fossil fuels makes us very susceptible to changes in the market.  <\/p>  <p>  Our country has a considerable record when it comes to human rights.  Our aid is poverty focused and untied.  We played a phenomenal role in developing the sustainable development goals and getting agreement on them.  The Minister's Department is taking part in the first voluntary national review of progress.  Climate change or some aspect of it is a feature of practically every one of those sustainable development goals.  We need to achieve policy coherence.

I acknowledge the efforts of the Citizens' Assembly in its discussions on how to make Ireland not just compliant in respect of climate change mitigation but also a leader.  This is something we need to remember as we experience this unprecedented heatwave and other recent weather phenomena which are happening with increasing frequency every year.  Just last month, a European report found that Ireland ranks worst in Europe for taking action against climate change, yet the Minister responsible for climate action denies this, which is quite unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan indicated, Report Stage of my Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill will be taken in the D&aacute;il next week.  The Bill proposes to compel the Government to divest public money in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund from fossil fuel companies.  If enacted, it will compel Ireland to comply with Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, which expects countries to make finance flows consistent with the pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.  I thank the Government for its support in seeing the Bill progress and I hope to see it pass next week.  I also thank those from Tr&oacute;caire and the Global Legal Action Network, GLAN, who worked diligently on the content of the Bill.  I hope Deputies across the House will support it as it progresses.  Divestment is one of a broad range of actions Government must take if we are to mitigate climate change.  I look forward to working on those issues as they come before the new committee.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget that it is vulnerable populations around the world that will pay the price.  People are already dying from climate change.  It is our responsibility in the West to do what is in our power to carry the burden for those who cannot protect themselves.<\/p>  <p>  As a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I am aware that the agriculture sector has a lot of catching up to do and that there are many camps on the issue of climate change within that sector.  We need real and concrete solutions that reflect burden sharing that is fair and appropriate.  Larger farmers and factories produce phenomenally more carbon emissions than small-scale farmers.  The burden sharing is entirely disproportionate.  Large companies in the agriculture sector should be compelled to play their part in climate action while small farmers should be supported in their attempts to reduce carbon emissions as well as assessing climate risk.  I hope to look more closely at this scenario in my work in the special committee on climate change as well as exploring the full range of opportunities available to Ireland.  I look forward to seeing a more ambitious initiative coming before the Houses as a result.

Farmers are in serious difficulties in these times and are caught in a system called calendar farming which no Deputy will understand unless he is a farmer.  There are plenty of other ways we need to tackle our climate issues rather than pointing the finger at the farmer all the time.<\/p>  <p>  Last Sunday evening I attended a protest.  There is no talk about it in here except from a couple of Independent Deputies.  It was a protest in my constituency area of Bantry where hundreds of people turned up with one clear message, that the people of Bantry do not want mechanical harvesting of kelp, which will be the cause of an environmental disaster on our shoreline.  These people want to protect their waters.  An areas of 1,860 acres is to be mechanically harvested.  No one in the Government wants to stand by the people of Bantry.  They want us all to lie down.  The livelihoods of the fishermen who depend on fishing in these waters are at stake.  In the last year, I have worked very closely with the Bantry group and have raised the issue of kelp many times in the House.  Only last week, I asked the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions to stop the mechanical harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay.  I am over a year pleading with the Government to take action and it has stood idly by when it could revoke the licence under Article 12.2.

I have listened to Ministers one after the other who seem to be itching for an election.  They are doing everything they can to prod for an election.  I have little or no faith in Fine Gael and its Independent Ministers.  They have one of the worst environmental records I have ever seen in politics and are shaming our country but I have faith in this D&aacute;il and want to see it last one more year to bring in Deputy Pringle's legislation, legislation to stop oil and gas exploration and the waste reduction Bill, and to allow this climate committee to do its work because it is critical work.  It is some of the most important work we need to do.<\/p>  <p>  We need a new national climate and energy plan by the end of this year.  The current one is not fit for purpose.  Every single expert I met at the national economic dialogue recognised that last week.  If they did not say it to the Minister, they said that Project Ireland 2040 will not deliver on climate.  We are going to miss by a country mile.  It has to change.  The job of this committee is to help Government and the public service work out how we do it.  It will be bloody difficult.  The scale of the challenge is immense.  If we were serious, we would start today by putting 20% of our transport budget into making our roads safe so our kids can cycle to school rather than the current reality where more schoolchildren drive themselves to school than cycle.  If we were serious, we would stop peat production today because we know on foot of the meeting the Minister had last week that our biggest problem in the midlands is the shortage of workers to undertake the climate work that needs to be done.  Could we not take those Bord na M&oacute;na workers, retrain them very quickly and pay them really well for the very skilled job of making our homes fit for purpose?  That could and should be done today.<\/p>  <p>  This committee is vital because it can help and open the books on the new climate and energy plan which we must do under European legislation.  We have no choice in this matter and we must have a first draft by the end of the year.  The timeline of this committee is set on that basis.  We need to meet next week as a committee.  I look forward to taking part in it.  We need to work collectively.  The first thing we need to agree is the research back up we will have.  We need to pull in Irish universities and the expertise they have.  It should be remembered that we only have months, not years, to do this so we must be quick.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Dooley made a valid point.  We should get research capability from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission because this is difficult and technical work, so in the short time we have to do the proper analysis, we should get this help.  We should set up our research teams in September and start our first meetings in October.  We should bring in the seven key Secretaries General, call them to account regarding what their Departments are going to do and show them - they know this already - that the mathematics of the existing national development plan simply do not work.  It is millions of miles away from where we need to go so the simple question involves what we are going to do.  What will we change, because change we must?  The centre of it is finance in terms of where the budget goes.<\/p>  <p>  We will not complete the work until the end of November so the interim budget will need to be done but we should have a key role in the development of this new national climate and energy plan, which must be done by the end of the year with the final agreement being agreed with Europe next year.  It is for that reason that I say that this D&aacute;il should stay together for another year.  Let us have the local and European elections and then have a general election.  I cannot imagine it going any further.  I cannot imagine that Fianna F&aacute;il would agree another budget but it can agree this year's budget.  We have vital work to do in climate as much as in anything else.<\/p>  <p>  The attractive thing about it is that it provides a vision for this country for the future, one that is positive and that is not just spin.  It is a real vision that brings about social change.  I hear none of that in the Government.  All I hear is it playing political games for its own advantage rather than thinking of the national interest.  If it was thinking of the national interest, it would stay the course for another year, we would do the work we must do and the D&aacute;il would pass Deputy Pringle's Bill, which I look forward to passing next week.  It will be the first step in restoring our international reputation, which is in the dog house.  I am sorry for insulting dogs.  We are in the dog house in terms of how we are seen with regard to climate.  That is not fair to the people.<\/p>  <p>  We are not bad at dealing with climate.  We are itching to be good at this.  The thing that is holding us back is the lack of political will, and the evidence is in the committee I have just come from where I have heard civil servants say yet again that gas is good and we should be looking for more of our own oil.  That day is over.  There is an open opportunity for us to be brilliant at developing renewables and efficiency and at managing water, really smart farming and really new transport systems.  The current transport system does not work.  The Government can add 63 motorways in its new national development plan but they will not solve the gridlock that is coming.

Despite the fact that nobody in this House wants to acknowledge it, the fact is that one in every five euro in capital investment this Government will spend over the next decade will have a climate focus.  That is significant.  It is significant in European and global terms.  Yes, we have a lot of work to do but we will be the first country in Europe to introduce a ban on smoky coal from September 2018.  We will spend &euro;4 billion on energy efficiency upgrades.  In the next 200 months, we will take dirty fossil fuels out of our heating systems.  That is no mean achievement either.  We will extend to every home in this country that is affected by fuel poverty the warmth and well-being pilot scheme that was rolled out over the past two years, and we will do so through the fuel allowance, the domiciliary care allowance by the end of this year, and the carer's allowance.  Every one of those families will be able to have a deep retrofit of their home carried out free of charge.  This is a real practical example of what we are doing and it does show leadership.  We will be the first country in Europe to ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars from 2030.<\/p>  <p>  It is a bit cheeky for people to say we are not taking leadership roles when we clearly are taking them and are putting the cash and funding in place.  CAN Europe has been critical of us and has argued that we are not looking for enough ambition at European level.  Last Monday, I pushed the Commission hard with regard to CO2 standards for cars.  The Commissioner was looking for a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions over the next decade.  I think this is far short of where it should be.  It should be a minimum of 50%.  CAN Europe or any of the other environmentalists did not say that the Irish Government was right to do that because they seem just to focus on it when it is on the agenda of the big member states rather than when small member states want assistance to help reach their targets.<\/p>  <p>  We are going to ban the burning of coal in Moneypoint by 2025 and peat at the latest by 2030.  Our national broadband plan will have a significant impact on transport emissions in rural areas.  We want to become a global leader in terms of food waste and introduce district heating in tandem with that.  Bord na M&oacute;na BioEnergy has been set up.  We are looking at developing a new biomass industry in this country.  The support scheme for renewable heat will operate this year.  Before the summer, I will bring to Government a paper on the renewable electricity support scheme to approve a microgeneration scheme for domestic users.  We have brought in user charges relating to waste, a new recycling regime for tyres, the beef data and genomics scheme and the smart farming initiative.  We have the smartest grids globally.  Global energy experts are now coming to Ireland to see what we are doing so we have ambition.  Can we be more ambitious?  Absolutely, but it must be a practical ambition that we can implement.<\/p><p>We are setting targets in that regard.  I look forward to working with and engaging with the committee on this.<\/p> <p> It would have been nice to at least have acknowledgement of what we are doing.  Within the past 100 weeks, things have changed, and changed significantly.  I accept that things could have been done better in the past and that if they had been, we would not be in the position we are in today.  Let us start by leading from here on.  Let us start by making sure we get as close as possible to our 2020 targets to put us on a proper trajectory towards 2030.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, this is the argument I was making to my colleagues at European level.  It does not make sense for Ireland to pay penalties from 2021 when we should be using that money to invest in reaching our 2030 targets.  We did not seek to alter our 2030 target.  What we did was put a proper trajectory in place.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and his perspective on climate, the measures we are talking about need to be taken anyway.  The economy is far too dependent on imported fossil fuels and we need to become self-sufficient in regard to energy.  Renewable energy for our economy is the right way to go.<\/p> <p> With regard to farming, we can do far better by managing our grasslands better.  The smart farming initiative we are rolling out across the country will see a reduction in overall emissions by 10% and increased profitability for every single farmer.  For that reason, if for no other, it should be done.  Broadband will also have a dramatic impact on the opportunities across rural Ireland as well as having an impact on climate.<\/p> <p> There are huge co-benefits which result from putting the investment in place, benefits that will disproportionately benefit people in rural Ireland above all others.  Let us all start working together in a constructive way to put a practical, implementable and ambitious plan in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300022#U00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530633000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1530633000,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300023#V00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","time":1530633000,"counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300023#V00450"},{"type":"question","time":1530633000,"counter":243,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[29059\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300023#V00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when legislation to increase the compulsory retirement age for public servants will be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1530633000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>In May the Minister assured us the legislation to cater for the increase in the compulsory retirement age for public servants would be introduced but it has not happened.

Those public servants will continue to accrue retirement benefits up to the new compulsory retirement age of 70, subject to a maximum of 40 years' service.

What is very striking to me is the current change in recruitment levels within our health services.  Between the start of January 2018 and the end of April, the HSE has recruited an additional 1,519 whole-time equivalents.  This translates as an average of 318 new people being hired to work in our health services every month.

In particular, a target of\u00a050:50 gender balance in new appointments at senior levels is now in place.

On Thursday, 21 June Deputy Stanley and I were at a very well attended public meeting in Ratheniska on this matter.  A local committee has been in touch with me in the meantime asking that I make the following points when I raise the issue with the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  At the meeting, it was proposed that the three local Deputies - the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Stanley and I - seek collectively to meet the new CEO of EirGrid, Mr. Mark Foley.  The committee asked me to ensure the local group is represented at such a meeting.  It would be useful and normal for elected Members to bring a local delegation to such a meeting and I hope when the meeting takes place the group will be involved.  We have been asked to ensure that any such meeting will be in the context of EirGrid not proceeding with the project, which has not received public support.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, asked EirGrid to pack up and leave the county and not to come back.  I reiterate that statement.  Too much damage has been done and trust in EirGrid and the ESB, as the operative for the proposed project, is at an all-time low in the local area.  The committee does not see much value in meeting EirGrid and I understand the reason it has taken that view given the number of times it has been let.  Nevertheless, I urge its members to attend the meeting.  As public representatives, we are standing by this group which has been shabbily treated by EirGrid, not to speak of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which bullied it for costs on the steps of the court and forced it to withdraw from the process at a moment's notice.<\/p>  <p>  I made a commitment to table a parliamentary question seeking the details of the officials who met EirGrid to discuss this matter some time ago.  The Minister kindly gave us an information note on that meeting last week.  We want to know who authored the note.  I have sought information on the tender document for the construction work, which should be a public contract.  We want to see precisely what work is to be carried out.

It has lost the confidence and trust of the community.  People do not believe what they are being told about the project.

I welcome the opportunity provided to me by the Deputies to discuss what is an essential electricity grid enhancement project for the midlands.  To ensure the national electricity grid is fit for purpose in modern times, it is necessary to carry out grid refurbishment and enhancement on an ongoing basis.  In this, EirGrid and ESB Networks work in close co-operation with the ultimate goal of enhancing the national electricity grid in order that it can support Ireland's continued economic development.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the Laois-Kilkenny electricity grid reinforcement project is required to improve the security of electricity supply in the midland region.  This &euro;110 million investment in the area will ensure the electricity network can meet current and future needs of all users, from homes and farms to small businesses and industrial customers.  The Coolnabacca electricity station in County Laois is part of the project, which was granted planning permission in 2014 by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As part of the planning process for the project, an environmental impact statement was completed.<\/p>  <p>  The previous debate on this development in June of last year was triggered by a regrettable and unacceptable breach of planning, when works started at the site in April 2017 without the planning conditions being discharged.  The site was restored to its original state by September 2017 and EirGrid and ESB Networks have since reviewed their processes internally to ensure such an oversight does not occur in the future.  Following a commitment I made during the debate, my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and I attended a meeting with members of the community on 18 January 2018.  At the meeting, the Ratheniska, Timahoe, Spink and surrounding areas substation action group outlined aspects of the project with which it was dissatisfied.  These aspects covered issues of concern from the origins of the project in 2009 to the present day.  I listened carefully to the many views expressed and I undertook to further consider the issues raised.  After the meeting, my officials set about examining these issues and to that end they have engaged with EirGrid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and other parties.  In response to Deputy Fleming, I asked that those issues be addressed.  My officials followed them up with EirGrid and the other agencies.  I gave a copy of the report to Deputy Fleming when it was presented to me.<\/p><p>I will relay the Deputies' request for a meeting and associated comments directly to EirGrid.  I do not have the requested information in regard to the tender documentation.  As much documentation as possible should be put into the public domain and I will also relay that request to EirGrid.<br\/><br\/>I will follow up the point raised by Deputy Stanley in regard to the correspondence from the committee with my office and ensure it is responded to.<br\/><br\/>Local groups have claimed that the aquifer in the area is being harmed.  Water hydrology was fully considered in section 8 of the environmental report submitted with the planning application, which is available on the EirGrid website.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Although for the wider groundwater body hydraulic continuity exists between the Sand and Gravel deposits and the bedrock aquifer, within the localised site area any groundwater in the sand and gravel deposits is not expected to be in hydraulic continuity with the bedrock aquifer underlying the site. This is due to the presence of a proved significant thickness of low permeability Clay deposits, with between 2.7m to 6.8m of clay proved beneath the Sand and Gravel deposits.  The clay encountered during the investigations is described as stiff to very stiff at depth, and this stiff clay will impede any vertical groundwater flow.<\/blockquote><p>The aquifer was discussed as part of the oral hearing in 2013.  During the examination of the issues raised, the Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, groundwater expert carried out a desktop review of the issue and provided a report.  In summary, the GSI confirmed that a locally important sand and gravel aquifer underlies the region around the site of interest and noted that the proposed development is outside of any known groundwater drinking water supply source protection zone.

I also wish to put on record my appreciation for his efforts in securing the future of Cullion fish farm in Mullingar.  He attended a public meeting with me and Councillor Andrew Duncan on the matter and I am happy to note that the fish farm remains a key component of the local infrastructure that keeps our lakes in good condition for anglers.<\/p>  <p>  I raise the issue of the failure to designate Lough Ennell as a wild brown trout fishery.  The largest trout caught in Ireland, weighing 26 lb, was caught in Lough Ennell, which encompasses an area of 3,540 acres or 14.3 sq. km.  Two thirds of its area is less than 25 ft deep and it has a pH of 7.5, which enables the production of large quantities of fish food.  There has been no man-made intervention to the lake, which makes it a natural brown trout lake and a world leader in that respect.  There are several brown trout lakes in the European Union but Lough Ennell is the jewel in the crown as it is not stocked by fish farms and is unique in terms of the replenishment of fish food and production of trout.  Anglers have repeatedly noted the remarkable composition and colour of trout from Lough Ennell.  Some are shaped like summer salmon, which is very unusual, and coloured like sea trout.<\/p><p>It is also noted that they are a hard fighting fish, which is part of their genetic make-up and is case specific to the lake.  It is important to point out also that the water qualify in Lough Ennell has improved significantly, and excelled in recent years, culminating in huge numbers of anglers coming to the lake.<\/p> <p> The critical concern to us in Westmeath is that if Lough Ennell is not included on its merits in this designation, it will be left off the map for future investment and there is no doubt that investment is required in this area.  It is important to note that the lake has not been stocked in the past, which means it is authentic and ensures the quality of fish in the lake, which are very resilient and have their own unique traits.

He has raised matters to do with angling with me on a number of occasions and showcased its importance for County Westmeath and the midlands.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, I have given notice of proposals to make a designated salmonid waters by-law and instigated a public consultation where observations on the draft proposals may be expressed at any time during a 21 day period which concluded at 5 p.m. on 25 May 2018.  In total, 5,531 submissions were received in this process.  A small number were received regarding Lough Gill.  More than 16 issues were raised during the process, one of which we have categorised as to include Lough Gill as part of the by-law.<\/p>  <p>  The overall intention behind the proposed draft by-law is to afford additional protection to wild brown trout and its scope is confined to seven distinctive State-owned waters where established stock control measures are already in place as a matter of existing policy.  The seven waters are Lough Sheelin in the Limerick fishery district, Lough Conn and Lough Cullin in the Ballina fishery district, Lough Corrib, Lough Mask and Lough Carra in the Galway fishery district and Lough Arrow in the Sligo fishery district.  These seven limestone lakes are unique in terms of topography and trout habitat and have been managed as wild brown trout fisheries via established stock management programmes.  From that perspective, these waters are especially important.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed by-law would give statutory status to the policy designation of this small number of distinctive waters and would mean that the waters concerned would continue to be managed primarily as brown trout waters.<\/p>  <p>  In December last, I first indicated to officials in the Department my view that the importance of these waters should be reflected by way of statutory designation.  Advice and observations were subsequently sought from departmental officials at a meeting on 17 January as regards the prospective legislative processes available in regard to the designation of these waters.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed by-law, as secondary legislation, is intended to focus on existing policy designation on State-owned waters where stock management is in place.  My policy initiative was to focus on designating these seven distinctive waters, which are considered singularly important.<\/p>  <p>  The complexity of a broader designation of waters, and any required management measures, will have be considered as a matter of primary legislation.  Therefore, I have directed that this matter is to be considered in the context of the major inland fisheries consolidation Bill currently being advanced by the Department.  As the Deputy is aware, any primary legislation would be a matter for all parties and Members of the House.  I accept the interest and advocacy of Deputy Burke and Councillor Andrew Duncan in including Lough Gill in a particular by-law.  This by-law, which has been the subject of a consultation and seen an unprecedented amount of interest compared to other by-laws, has included a number of submissions in favour of including Lough Ennel.  We are assessing it and taking legal advice on the draft by-law with a view to enacting it as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  On the primary legislation, the consolidation work is ongoing.  I understand the strong case put forward by the Deputy for the inclusion of Lough Ennell and for protected status, although I also accept that Lough Ennel's attributes can be promoted irrespective of a designation.  Its status as a wild brown trout fishery can be promoted through the local authority and whatever assistance Inland Fisheries Ireland can give the Deputy.  I will set up a meeting with officials to further discuss what can be done to Lough Ennell to promote it and angling tourism in the midlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300034#GG00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1530639600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

These are experienced anglers in their field and they have put forward a concrete case that Lough Ennell would be included in this designation.  I would point out that Lough Ennell is the record holder in Ireland for wild brown trout.  It is unique in its field.  When the Minister points out the attributes of the other lakes it is important that he is aware that this lake is self-sufficient.  It has not had any man made intervention, and it has not seen stocked.  It is a rare type of lake, which is difficult to find worldwide.  When we have a treasure like that, it is very important that we promote it but also that we protect it and ensure that it will be a viable entity to attract tourism in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome also the Minister's comment that he will talk to Inland Fisheries Ireland about the promotion of the lake because I believe it has not been promoted enough.  Many of these issues fall on the doorstep of the local authority, which at times can be under constraints as a result of budgets etc.  It is very important that we have a joined-up approach and that lakes such as these are fully promoted due to the fact that they are a vital component of the local economy.  What lakes such as this one can contribute to a vibrant economy and to making rural areas sustainable is a point that is sometimes missed.

Large brewers are providing free stock, advance discounts, capex or cash investments to on-trade publicans on condition of excluding competitors and their beers or ciders.  This is a serious issue for the industry.  I am bringing legislation, which the Government is supporting, to the House to allow craft brewers to sell their products and grow.  Those provisions are being neutralised by what I feel are anti-competitive practices whereby large brewing companies are coming in, offering all these incentives and basically telling craft brewers and, dare I say it, other brewers, to take their stock off the shelves and off draft.  The are telling publicans they will give them funds, that they will pay for refurbishment, give them free kegs and even cash as long as they get rid of the other brands.  How is that not illegal?  No-one can tell me it is not anti-competitive.  It already happened in Greece, where a subsidiary of Heineken had a large-scale fine put on in the tens of millions.  There was a case in Greece where a small brewer took a high court action for similar practices.  It is going on here in Ireland.<\/p> <p> I was in a pub in Cork recently where there were 21 taps of which 19 were from the one brewing company.  There were two for Guinness because, as we all know, they cannot get rid of the Guinness.  Did anyone else try to get into that pub?  Of course.  Why are they not there?  This is happening all over Dublin and all over the country.  They go to the largest pub in each town, the opinion forming pub, and try to influence it.  They offer to do a deal with that publican that if he takes out the rest, or at least takes them off draught, they will look after him.  I have a list in my hand.  Basically every county in Ireland is on it.<\/p> <p> The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is well aware of this.  It has had a number of complaints.  I do not think it has the resources to deal with them.  It is not a priority.  This is affecting jobs all over the country.  My county has four craft brewers.  I look at Bulmers in Clonmel and I know across the country they are absolutely being devastated by this decision.  I know of one brewer, a Munster brewer, who gave out about being taken out of a pub and was then taken out of a range of pubs in a geographical area because they put their head above the parapet and made a complaint.  This is not on.<\/p> <p> We need the Minister of State to get on to the CCPC to say this needs to be investigated properly once and for all and ensure that these anti-competitive practices stop to allow a fledgling industry to grow, to allow for fair competition and to ensure that other laws such as tax laws are being adhered to properly across the board.  We must ensure that people are being protected and there is not a dominant brewing company or companies in this country, originally from outside this country, behaving in an anti-competitive way and costing Irish people jobs.  The bottom line is that if this is not investigated, jobs will continue to be lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300034#GG00600","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530640200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelly for raising this issue.

I have been all over the country and have seen the importance of the craft brewery industry and the role it is playing in rural areas where we might not otherwise get industry.  It is an important sector in Ireland and I very much note Deputy Kelly's interest in it.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, to which the Deputy referred, is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU competition law in the State.  It is important to point out that section 9(5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of alleged anti-competitive practices, which the Deputy has alleged.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has no direct function in such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Competition rules seek to provide everyone with better quality goods and services at lower prices by ensuring that firms compete solely on their merits.  In a competitive market, the simplest way for a company to gain more market share is to offer a better price than its competitors.  This is not only good for consumers; when more people can afford to buy products, it encourages businesses to produce and boosts the economy in general.<\/p>  <p>  In a competitive market, businesses will try to make their products different from the rest so they are more attractive.  That is a very important part of the marketing of any product.  This results in greater choice: consumers can select the product that offers the right balance between price and quality.  To deliver this choice and produce better products businesses need to be innovative.  It is very important for any business to be innovative.  That is why some of the smarter craft brewing companies will do well with their products, design, production techniques and services.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses may freely enter into a contract whereby one business agrees to buy from or supply all of its goods or services to the other.  Such agreements may create benefits for businesses, competition and ultimately consumers.  For example, a supplier and retailer may agree that only the supplier&rsquo;s product will be sold in a retailer&rsquo;s stores, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, allowing the supplier to invest more heavily in the marketing or promotional efforts of the retailer.  Exclusivity arrangements between businesses therefore in many cases do not raise competitive concerns and are not necessarily in themselves a breach of competition law.  It is only where such agreements could exclude competitors from the entire market, and not individual businesses, that such agreements can be regarded as anti-competitive.  Concerns relating to exclusivity agreements are, therefore, examined by the CCPC on a case by case basis.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of complaints made by distributors about exclusivity agreements, the CCPC has indicated that it has examined the use of such incentives in the on-trade supply of alcohol.  The CCPC has indicated that it is important to note before a decision can be made on whether it should open an investigation, each complaint is examined through a rigorous screening process.  Factors such as the nature of the complaint, the characteristics of the market and the evidence available all have a bearing on this process.  After a robust examination it was determined that the CCPC did not have grounds to suspect a breach of the law.  The CCPC can only initiate a full investigation where there is sufficient evidence of a suspected breach of Irish or EU competition law.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the CCPC&rsquo;s examination has shown that the relevant exclusivity agreements were used in a small number of pubs in the State and that other brewers and-or distributors large and small still had access to the vast majority of pubs and other outlets.  I understand that the CCPC will keep under review the potential impact of such arrangements and it will continue to monitor the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300035#HH00400","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1530640200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Let us call a spade a spade.

Market dominance is being abused.  A whole range of publicans are being approached with these incentives.  It is happening everywhere, whether it is rebates, refurbishment, kegs, cash or whatever.  There is a whole mix of ways of doing this.  I have no problems with publicans getting deals: that is their right.  When it means that smaller or medium sized brewers are being excluded, that is wrong - morally wrong and absolutely illegal.

This would take a sizeable investigation and the CCPC does not have the resources to do this.<\/p> <p> Large amounts of cash and resources are being used and these practices are happening in large pubs in all cities and towns in Ireland.  Large rebates are being given to publicans if they can show a certain level of sales.  I cannot understand anybody who tells me that this is not anti-competitive and I will not accept it.  It is a lazy response.  Any situation involving market dominance where someone ensures that the products of small players are not allowed on the shelf or to be made available on tap is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> The reason publicans have licences which are reviewed every year is because they must act in a certain way.

The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been pushing this issue in government with the Minister and we have been supporting him.

The HSE has advised that the posts will be required to facilitate the service extension to the existing cath lab were originally envisaged to be reduced whole-time equivalent posts, that is, all posts were 0.25 whole-time equivalent with the exception of the nursing posts, which were 0.75 whole-time equivalent.  While it has proved difficult to recruit suitably qualified staff for the 0.25 whole-time equivalent posts, these posts have now been designated as full-time equivalents.

We know that massive damage has been done over the past 40 years to Irish wildlife.  We know that modern society is particularly bad when it comes to diversity and its impact on nature.  We currently see billions of tonnes of plastic in either landfill or in the sea, killing diversity there.  We know that as a society, we are doing massive damage to the climate at present.  We know this damages us because we have a symbiotic relationship with nature, the natural world is vital for human well-being and biodiversity is an urgent issue.  We know that Governments say one thing and do another.  They talk about protection of the environment when in fact they collude in its destruction.  It is becoming massively difficult for farmers in this country as well.  Farmers find it difficult to make a living and they are pushed to the pin of their collars.  In many ways some farmers will see this as a way to make life a little bit easier for themselves in how they go about their work but it will not address the major needs that farmers have.<\/p>  <p>  We also know that the cutting back of hedges and the burning of moorland and mountain tops physically reduces the habitat of animals at key stages of their development.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the firefighters in County Meath who are currently battling away trying to deal with a bog fire outside of Kildalkey.  We know that even within their timescale, these fires can be quite dangerous in how they are used.  Most fires in this country happen outside of the legal process and very few happen within a controlled area.<\/p>  <p>  In reality, this particular Bill will not do a lot for either farmers or conservationists because the difficulties both groups have are very complex and quite large and will not be dealt with by this Bill.  The amendments I have tabled that we are discussing here seek to simply protect the natural environment, our heritage and biodiversity and to do so in a scientific way in order that we understand exactly the impact we are having on that diversity.  I understand that some people will make the argument that there is a necessity for better road safety and that is one of the reasons why the extension to the cutting of hedges is being given.  I was involved in a serious accident myself on a narrow road where there were large hedges.  There are ways to resolve that without causing damage to the biodiversity of our natural environment and which could allow for residents, farmers or people who use particular roads to contact a local authority and seek for verges or hedges to be cut in a timely fashion to ensure that traffic and transport is safe along those thoroughfares.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the Minister takes a pause and sees the damage that would be done by this Bill and I encourage her to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00100","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eamon Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Do we not speak in the order of the amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I am taking them in the order in which the Deputies indicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thought the Ceann Comhairle followed the order of the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>We can do that but we will hear all of the Deputies.

I hope that we can do this in an iterative way because this deserves real attention and our forensic focus in what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  I had the privilege at the weekend of cycling down through Wexford and back up through Wicklow.  There is nothing like cycling to get a sense of the countryside.  What I got a sense of was a countryside under stress.  Anyone who is involved in farming would know it, particularly in the south east.<\/p>  <p>  I saw the hedgerows with plastic bottles littered everywhere but in the fields there were cattle standing in dry, dusty pasture and they were being fed from first cut silage and next winter's fodder without any sign of growth.  It is a tough time for Irish farming and we need to make sure that they have a secure and healthy future.  I will be honest in that it reminded me how wonderful this country is because of our hedgerows.  I know there is an issue around road safety and we have to look after that but it is one of the spectacular things about nature in our country that unlike other countries we have hedgerows of quality.  I hope Deputy Fitzmaurice does not mind me giving away what we said in a private conversation over tea, but as it happens we were just talking about his memory of growing up in the west where there would be a field with a five hedge system.  They were told by all the Teagasc experts to get rid of them so that they would have a more productive system and then they realised that they lost the ability to manage floodwaters.  The services the hedgerows provided were significant and real.  That is why we bitterly and deeply oppose these provisions in this Bill.  We feel that it risks a further degradation and deterioration in our hedgerow system.<\/p>  <p>  In the latter part of my journey, having cycled down as far as Ballymoney in Wexford I headed back up through Wicklow, up over the mountains by the Sally Gap and for the section for several miles between the Sally Gap and Kippure I was cycling through a burnt wasteland.  The mountain was on fire.  There was a 3 sq. km bog fire and it was spectacular in scale and size.  Further on at the edge of Lough Bray Upper, a spectacular area which people know, the Air Corps were doing an incredible job trying to scoop water out of the lake and put out the fire.  I talked to the rangers who happened to be there and they said that the problem is that the peat is so hot now that it is reigniting all of the time.  It is almost self-reigniting.  The fires must have been started as a result of human intervention and there are real questions around that.  Maybe it was just my personal experience but to cycle for miles through a smoke filled, burnt environment reminded me that we have to be careful in what we do with our mountains.<\/p>  <p>  One other change that has taken place since we last discussed this Bill is that RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" programme which showed up the lack of enforcement of environmental regulations in this country and all of the reassurances the Minister has given on Committee Stage and in previous Readings count for nothing in my mind because if we cannot manage illegal dumps ten times the size of this room, how will we look after a nest?  I have been provided with some figures since our discussion on this issue last week as to what we are doing in terms of enforcement of existing wildlife protection measures and the number of people who have been in breach of them and the answer is that nothing has been done.  If burning on the mountain tops are looked at, again none of it is properly co-ordinated.  It is promised that it will be done in a regulated and safe way but the evidence is the exact opposite.  Whatever advantage that may come in certain circumstances where someone wants to cut back shrub or encourage grass or heather growth for a particular species, and there may be some advantage, that is not what is happening.  We are burning land and then going back burning it again a few years later in a way that is destroying the environment.  We are burning in environments where it fundamentally changes, distorts and destroys the environment and that will only get worse in an environment that is changing because of climate change.  I mentioned the farmers at the very start because we need a national land use plan where we sit down with our farmers and work out in real detail what our plan is, what we will do, how we will create an income and how we will pay those farmers in the areas that are not advantaged by rich land and pasture, how will we pay them for the services they provide in helping us to manage floodwaters, in helping to provide biodiversity and in providing recreational value and assets.<\/p><p>That is what we should be doing.  We should not allow burning in March and cutting of hedges in August.  That is plain wrong.  There are several of our amendments in that grouping but our first preference is to take out section 7 and recognise that the Bill does an acute disservice to our environment and should be stopped.  There are various options in the amendments but if we insist on providing protection for road users, which is valid, our amendments make sure the Bill achieves that purpose.  It is not a question of wholesale destruction of the environment.  It is specific and forensic and achieves that objective.<\/p> <p> The problem with the Bill is that it takes a wholesale \"let it go, let them burn, let it be cut\" attitude when the problem is not the people who want to maintain their fences and hedgerows and maintain the land properly.  They can do that.  In the off-peak periods they can cut hedges and manage the uplands.  The problem with the hedgerows is people who do not do what they need to do.  That needs local authority intervention and management.  It does not need Fine Gael writing a blank cheque to slash every hedge in the country which I fear will happen as a result of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300040#NN00900","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530643800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>One gets great pleasure from walking the hills and laneways or cycling pathways and using all the attractions that this country has to offer, despite the loss of habitats and species, the 40% reduction in the bee population, which is quite scary when we realise the role the bee plays in the food chain and the reproductive life of this island, and the red listing of six or seven native species of birds in danger of extinction.  This Bill will take the cutting period, which is now closed from April to August to protect the very vegetation and wildlife that I have spoken about during the months of growth and reproduction, and extend it by another month at either end.  I cannot understand the thinking behind that and I wish the Minister would explain it.  I hope she accepts the amendment which is so important because during these periods wildlife is beginning to nest and reproduce and is at its best.<\/p><p>If the insect species that inhabit all hedgerows, uplands and bogs etc. are deprived of their existence, that will have a knock-on effect on the survival of other insects, birds and other animals.  Why would we deprive them of an opportunity to exist, with a knock-on effect on everybody else?  A total of 28% of Ireland's breeding birds are in decline and 31% of habitats are in decline.  Those in decline include the barn owl, the yellowhammer, the curlew, the golden plover, the red-breasted goose and the meadow pipit.  They all sound beautiful and they are beautiful and virtually unique to this country.  The action provided for in this Bill would endanger them.  The action of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in connection with wildlife inhabitants would not be countenanced anywhere else in Europe.  If the Minister can tell me this legislation is in line with any EU directives I would like to hear her do so.  Many Europeans who come to this country are already shocked at the lax and light-touch regulation in place to maintain our wildlife.<\/p><p>Allowing land users to define road safety is crazy.  With all due respect to farmers and land users, this is a level of democracy that is not allowed to anyone else.  Public sector workers do not have a say in how their jobs function, neighbourhood watch would not be allowed to have a say in how the community is policed but the Bill practically gives ownership of the Road Safety Authority to land users.  This is completely wrong.  While I have great respect for land users and farmers, they should not be allowed to define road safety.  That should be left to the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>When we make the effort there is considerable buy-in from farmers and communities in the idea of sustainability of farming, of local communities, habitats and animals and birds.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has focused very much on the Burren, carrying out sustainability exercises in County Clare because of the special nature of the area.  Having been there for a week's walking recently I can say it is working beautifully and is preserving the flowers, the bees, the birds and the nature that make up the wealth of that area, as well as helping the farmers to know how and when to farm in a correct way to help it survive.<\/p><p>Whether it is the uplands, the lowlands, the Burren, the hedgerows, or whatever it may be, we should be careful about passing this aspect of the Bill.  If we do we will give <i>carte blanche<\/i>to people to attack species when they are at their best, when they are young and reproducing and need to inhabit the hedgerows and bogs, etc.  We will also allow people to take over the role of the Road Safety Authority and in the course of so doing endanger the existence of many of our most beautiful species of birds.  We seek the removal of this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300041#OO00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1530643800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>It is fairly bizarre that in a Bill entitled the Heritage Bill the Government would propose measures that will destroy or threaten with extinction parts of our natural heritage.  Like Deputy Smith, I would like the Minister to explain what response she has to the concerns being raised by the people who are knowledgeable and expert in the protection of wildlife.  One of the junior Ministers &ndash; I will not name him &ndash; was chortling during the week when I was speaking about the birds and the bees.  He seemed to think it was funny but the birds and the bees matter.  The fact that a significant number of bee species face possible extinction, that we have had a huge loss of the bee population, as Deputy Smith said, and that a whole series of birds are on the red list, facing possible extinction because we have not protected their habitats, is serious.  The Government needs to explain how allowing measures that would destroy their habitats at crucial and sensitive times of year can possibly be justified.<\/p>  <p>  The point about road safety has been well made.  We already have legislative provisions which ensure that local authorities can cut down hedgerows that are a danger to road safety so we simply do not need to do it.  Burning times similar to those proposed in the Bill have not stopped upland fires in other places.  If somebody lights a match it does not matter at what time of year it is allowed or not, fires are caused.  These measures will not prevent some of the things the Government is saying they will prevent but they will destroy the habitats of the birds and the bees.<\/p><p>When our biodiversity needs greater support and protection and certain species are under threat and need to be protected, the Government is introducing measures that will do damage.  This makes a mockery of commitments that have been made.  We engaged with the Taoiseach the other day on the Government's commitments to biodiversity, yet it is allowing measures that will substantially reduce our biodiversity when it is under threat.  Despite it being one of our great assets and it could be a far bigger asset, the Government is allowing measures that will reduce our biodiversity.  I do not see the justification for them.   <\/p> <p> This should not be viewed as a debate between the environmentalists and the farmers, although it is often played out in that manner.  I accept that insofar as we need to take measures to protect our biodiversity, in doing so we must also support and engage with farmers and rural communities.<\/p> <p> One of the amendments we tabled, which was ruled out of order - I do not know why but I will not get into that debate now - proposed establishing a proper consultation process with the various stakeholders to examine how these issues could be addressed in a way that would not be damaging to the environment.  This did not occur in the context of the Bill.  The Minister is indicating there was consultation but according to the environmental organisations, that is not the case.  Those organisations are obviously all telling porkies.  They are very unhappy about what the Minister is proposing and 30,000 people have signed petitions protesting against her proposals.<\/p> <p> An email I received suggests this measure may well be in breach of the EU birds directive.  Has that been properly assessed?  A regulatory impact assessment was not done on this Bill.  Such an assessment constitutes best practice.  When one is considering introducing new regulations that may have a substantial impact on the environment they should be subject to a regulatory impact assessment.  Effectively, what the Minister is saying is that changing the law will itself be the assessment because there will be a trial.  She should have ensured a proper assessment was carried out beforehand to gauge whether the measures in this Bill could fall foul of EU directives on environmental protection, the birds directive and our biodiversity.  She should have engaged properly with environmentalists and people who are knowledgeable and expert in these areas who say she has not engaged to a satisfactory degree.  I appeal to her to reconsider and support this amendment which proposes the deletion of this controversial and concerning section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300041#OO00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530644400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>People need to understand that we have a managed landscape around this country.  I hear people talking about farmers but farmers are brought up in nature.  If a farmer causes destruction in his field, he pays for it as he will not receive any support from a State agency.  Sometimes it is harrowing for farmers to hear people talk about what they do when those people only see an acre of land on a television programme or when they drive by it but they have never had to farm it, live on it, earn a living from it and rear a family.  We need to be very conscious of that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, with whom I spoke about the Bill, will go discuss this point in more detail.  Everybody should be aware that, under the Roads Act, farmers are obliged to maintain their hedges.  If somebody gets hurt, the farmer is liable.  I point that out in case Members were not aware of it.  Everybody is talking about Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, local councils and others doing everything but if Members check the Roads Act 1993 it includes the wording \"a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation\" and if they pose a danger to a road user, the farmer is liable.  We need to be mindful of that when discussing the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan was right about what happened in the past.  I remember in the 1980s, the EU - it was not Teagasc and I will not blame a local body - gave grants to farmers not to knock hedges but to knock ditches in fields.  In my area we ended up turning five fields into one, but now we are coming full circle.  In fairness, a regulation introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provides that not more than 500 m can be knocked now, and rightly so.  That helped with respect to flooding, as the Deputy pointed out.  <\/p>  <p>  We are having great weather now but people need to be conscious that in September and October last year one could not go into a field on marginal ground in my area.  As I said the other night, our land is only becoming normal now.  In a month's time, we may be able to help deal with a problem on a road rather than ploughing up a field.  A farmer does not go into a field willy-nilly to cause destruction to wildlife.  We are brought up a different way.  We should make sure we are mindful of that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the burning of vegetation, anyone who comes from a rural area will know that when controlled burning is carried out there will be more food for the birds with the vegetation that grows back.  People do not understand some of these practices.  There is a saying that it would not feed a snipe but if one burns vegetation, what grows back will provide food for the birds.  We are brought up with nature.  We come from a managed landscape that the farmers of this country have to keep as best as is possible.  I am not saying everyone is perfect and no one will ever say that but, in fairness to most of farmers and especially those in the west, they are not rewarded for what they do.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to consider addressing one issue.  There is a great degree of land designation in the area from which I and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v come, which puts great pressure on farmers.  There is a danger that with land abandonment we will have an a unmanaged landscape, which would not be good for anyone.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to the Burren in County Clare.  It might serve the Deputy well to read back on what happened with the Burren in the past.  The State put millions of pounds into it and it was a total disaster.  The first thing it did was take the cows off the Burren.  When that was found not to work, the State listened to the farmers.  That is what is important.  People who live a distance from the countryside seem to believe they will tell everyone down the country how to live their lives.  In this case, the State listened to the farmers and the Deputy is right in pointing out that the Burren has been a success.  That is the type of partnership that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300042#PP00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1530644400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>They did burn not hedgerows.

The first is to allow burning in March.  I live in one of the wettest places in Ireland and the idea of burning anything in February is ludicrous.  The reality is that the burning of open hill has been going on for a long time.  As I said in the committee, there is a reference in the poem, \"Anach Cuan\" to \"Loscadh sl&eacute;ibhte agus scalladh cl&eacute;ibhe ... ar an mh&eacute;id a b&aacute;thadh\".  The poet was talking about loscadh sl&eacute;ibhte, which is basically the burning of the hills.  It was a type of curse he brought down on them.  It was a common phenomenon in his time and we know wildlife thrived at that time.  What we are talking about is very limited controlled burning.  I ask the Minister to indicate how limited it will be because I understand permission is needed for controlled burning.  She might explain to the House just how little controlled burning takes place.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is that the vegetation on a hill can grow and become very woody.  This means the heather is not like fresh heather and contains a great deal of wood.  The danger is that if somebody lights a match to it in this kind of weather, outside the burning system, the entire hill, as Deputy Ryan eloquently put it, will go up in flames.  The bog will then start to burn and we will have a big problem.<\/p><p>In most cases we do not know who starts these fires.  It was very interesting that when some farmers in Connemara were penalised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because their hill went on fire, we managed to get the penalty rowed back.  It was confirmed by the authorities that none of the farmers penalised was under any suspicion of having lit the fire.  We do not know.<\/p> <p> Nobody is proposing that we ban visitors to the countryside in hot or dry weather just because somebody might light a match.  It could just as easily be somebody from outside the area as inside the area.  As to who might do it, careless behaviour knows no limits.  There are thousands of people - thankfully - who visit the countryside at this time of the year.  All it takes is for somebody to light up during a careless picnic and up goes the mountain.  Blaming it on, or presuming the fault lies with, some local farmer is very unfair.  I do not attach blame to anybody and I do not believe we should keep anybody out of the countryside.  It is a risk we just have to take and live with.  Saying that controlled burning in March - it cannot be done in February on most hills - is going to cause destruction to the hills is not understanding what controlled burning is about.<\/p> <p> The other proposal in the Bill provides that under regulations not yet specified, hedge cutting would be allowed in August.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm in her reply if these regulations would have to be brought in by way of statutory instrument.  It would allow for one hedge, that is, roadside hedges.  In reality there are eight sides to a hedge.  If one takes the top of the hedge as being a side there are another four so there are 12 sides to a hedge, but we will take it as being eight sides.  The proposal is for a person to be allowed to cut one side of the hedge, the roadside, in a field that has a roadside.  Anyone who thinks that farmers are going to willy-nilly get out very expensive equipment and do the roadside hedges all around the country for no reason and then come back some time later in September or October and do the other sides of the hedge, knows very little about the efficiency of cutting hedges.  It would just allow for cutting a side of a hedge in August where it is deemed to be necessary to do so, basically for health and safety reasons.  If doing so, a person can do the whole face of the hedge.<\/p> <p> It is absolutely true that there is a lot more hedgerow in the State now than 40 or 50 years ago.  Land was much more intensively farmed and farmers did an awful lot of hedge cutting in times gone by, and 100 years ago every piece of useable land was used.  All of the hedges were cut back in the winter because there was very little other work to do.  They really cut them down in wintertime, without a doubt.  There is a challenge to biodiversity but is the cutting of roadside hedges the problem or is it pesticides, herbicides and other attacks on habitats?  Is it invasive species, including mammals that have come to Ireland, such as mink?  Are they the real destroyers or is it roadside hedges being cut in August?  We must ask ourselves this question.<\/p> <p> I live in a rural area where a lot of people never go down the boreens except the locals.  People go along the regional roads and the county class 1 roads, but they have not been down the tertiary roads, up the little valleys or down the little roads.  If the Minister was to talk to any parent of any schoolchild about the cutting of hedges before the children go back to school, the parents will tell us that their little sons or daughters should not be put at risk.  I am sorry but this is what the parents will tell the Minister; their sons or daughters should not be put at risk for the want of cutting just one face of a hedge in August.  This is what is proposed.<\/p> <p> The original Bill went further and was going to allow wholesale cutting of hedges in August.   We tabled an amendment in the Seanad.  The Minister has obviously accepted this amendment, which limits what was intended.  I believe it is minimal and puts human life where it should be, ahead of every other consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300042#PP00700","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530645000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>It is my privilege to represent the constituency of Dublin Rathdown but I was brought up in nature.

This is exactly why I share the grave concerns of wildlife and heritage organisations such as BirdWatch Ireland, the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland, the Irish Wildlife Trust, An Taisce and the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations.  I believe that sections 7 and 8 of the Bill are anti-heritage and should be consigned to the scrap heap.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is aware that in our own constituency of Dublin Rathdown, wildfires have raged in Ticknock and on the Blackglen Road.  Residents have been advised that the area is unsafe and to stay indoors.  This gives us a sneak preview of what it could be like if we extend the burning period.  Last year from 24 March to 22 May, the Irish Wildlife Trust recorded 97 illegal wildfires in rural areas.  Some 39 of these were in special conservation areas that are protected by EU habitats legislation.  Sadly, the current law and the penalties or sanctions imposed on persons who are convicted of such destructive vandalism fail abysmally to protect Ireland&rsquo;s heritage.  Instead of putting in place real disincentives, however, and carrying out a real investigation into what happened and providing appropriate supports to those affected by the forest infernos, the Government&rsquo;s sole response appears to be a determination - which seems to be growing by the day - to pass this anti-heritage slash and burn legislation.<\/p>  <p>  As other Members have outlined, burning outside of the current season jeopardises a vast array of wildlife.  For many birds, such as the endangered curlew whose population is in decline, March is a month of nesting.  This is the time when they establish their territories, create their nests and prepare for laying their eggs.  Curlews are facing global extinction.  There are only 125 breeding pairs of curlews left in Ireland.  There is a real risk that the Government's proposed change would be the last straw for the curlew.  We need courageous leadership to face down the vested interests to protect our heritage.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 16 put forward by the Green Party seeks to delete section 7(1) in its entirety.  We believe the burning period should not be extended to March, full stop.  We seek that subsection to be deleted entirely.<\/p>  <p>  On the other amendments in this group, amendments Nos. 15 to 23, inclusive, I ask the Acting Chairman's guidance.

Otherwise, this section could be used to apply to land which is covered under the part of section 40 that applies to hedges.  Similarly, amendment No. 21 seeks to restrict the application of section 7(2), which expands the Minister&rsquo;s power make regulations in respect of hedge cutting to just section 40(1)(<i>b<\/i>) in order that it does not open up all land covered under section 40, but just the land appropriate to hedge cutting regulation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 removes the power of the Minister to make regulations for the expansion of hedge cutting into August and replaces it with a power for the Minister to make regulations for derogations to section 40 of the Wildlife Act for the purpose of ensuring public health and safety under the Roads Acts, and outlining the parameters of any such regulations.  The Minister has said that section 7(2) will help to ensure that issues such as overgrown hedges can be tackled in August.

I will highlight some correspondence that I received about them and outline in particular concerns among beekeepers.  In one email, the correspondent, a beekeeper in east Cork, told me that the person's apiaries had decreased in size from an average of 15 in the early 1990s to, at best, nine today.  Honey bees are a great indicator species of the environment, as they only forage within a radius of 1.5 miles.  The decrease can mostly be attributed to changes in farming practices such as hedge cutting and hedgerow removal.  For that reason, the correspondent urged me to vote against sections 7 and 8.  This is testimony from someone with an interest in beekeeping.  Another person was concerned that the changes to the hedge cutting dates would lead to further declines in populations of the red listed yellowhammer, the linnet and the greenfinch and reduce essential food supplies for pollinators, of which one third are threatened with extinction.  These are just two samples of a large number of emails to me outlining concerns with sections 7 and 8.<\/p><p>I represent an urban-rural constituency.  I understand as well as western and north-western representatives sensitive issues in urban and rural areas.  I have an understanding of rural issues because I speak to people in rural Ireland every single day of the week.  We should not be going down the road of hedge cutting in the month of August.  It is not a question of extending the period for hedge cutting but of ensuring adequate resources in the first instance so that hedge cutting can be completed in 100% of cases where necessary during the apposite season.  When local authorities issue hedge cutting contracts, those contracts do not cover the entirety of the areas that need to be cut back.  It is foolish of the House to go down this road without a proper interrogation and examination of what we are proposing to do.<\/p><p>I am not a dyed in the wool, die in a ditch environmentalist, but I hope I have common sense.  I grew up spending large swathes of my time in the countryside and living in a town where one need only walk a mile to be out in the countryside.  One had an understanding of the seasons and how they worked.  Nesting was always vital and understood by rural dwellers.  For every Deputy who tells the House that farmers are custodians and will make the right decisions, many farmers in my area have expressed to me concerns about what is being proposed in this Bill.  Their concerns are echoed in the correspondence we have received from the likes of BirdWatch Ireland, with people telling us that Ireland's legal protections for nature are regressing.  I have had my issues with An Taisce, which is a stakeholder body, entering objections to young people's planning applications in rural Ireland.  I have my issues with many people who are headquartered, as it were, in Dublin and seek to profess widely of their knowledge of the dynamics of rural Ireland, but I do not know anyone who would disagree with the logic in BirdWatch Ireland's fears about this legislation, particularly sections 7 and 8.  I do not know to which vested interest these sections are pandering, but they are against nature.<\/p><p>If the right resources and budgets were allocated to local authorities during the current window of opportunity for hedge cutting, every single hedgerow in the counties we represent could be cut annually or biannually where necessary and the red herring of protecting the leana&iacute; going to school could not be used.<\/p><p>I pour scorn on the notion of selling this legislation as a two-year pilot covering all 26 counties.

It is a joke of a provision.<\/p><p>BirdWatch Ireland's submission reads:<\/p><blockquote>The legislation is being sold as a 2-year 'Pilot' period which covers all 26 counties but no methodology for such a pilot has been provided, no baseline data has been gathered.

Our climate is changing and our heritage and wildlife legislation needs to keep up with those changes.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Eamon Ryan's points, this Bill is the opposite of wholesale.  The Deputy is misinformed.  The two-year pilot period will be subject to regulations that will be laid before the Houses.  Not every hedge is roadside only.

It took until Sunday evening to bring them under control.  The area in question is in the Wicklow uplands special area of conservation, which contains high-value conservation habitats, including blanket bog, wet heath and dry heath.  There are still flare-ups in certain areas, fanned by a stiff breeze as the fires smoulder in the deep heat.  The only solution is to douse the areas with water.<\/p><p>Given the inaccessibility of the area, we have been using the resources of the Air Corps and private aircraft.  There is evidence that many of these fires may have been started maliciously.

I thank the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in Wicklow, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service and other emergency services for all their work in the past few days in trying to deal with these wildfires in difficult and arduous conditions.  The Deputy is aware that the main reason for the burning provisions is to allow people managing land to burn for proper land management purposes in March where, for example, weather has prevented this.  This year, the last day for burning was the day before Storm Emma.  The provisions of the Bill seek to do this while taking account of all of our responsibilities to protect our natural heritage and wildlife.

The green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, has been a huge success in helping farmers.  I think it is disingenuous and unfair for Deputy Catherine Martin to link illegal fires to responsible landowners and farmers, who are not the enemies of our heritage but its custodians, and have been for thousands of years.  I want to be clear that illegal burning should not and will not be tolerated.  We can all see from recent days the damage that can be caused by wildfires.  I hope that in cases where fires have been caused maliciously that those responsible face the full force of the law.  The Heritage Bill is not about illegal burning.  I am proposing to allow controlled burning in certain areas during March if it is deemed necessary due to adverse weather conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy Eamon Ryan's question, since 2011 my Department has taken over 50 prosecutions against individuals for breaches of section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  The most recent successful prosecution by my Department was in February, when a defendant was ordered to pay &euro;500 to a wildlife charity for illegally cutting and destroying hedges in County Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised the EU habitats directive and birds directive.  With Ireland as a member state, we unanimously adopted the directive in 1979.  Habitat loss and degradation are the most serious threats to the conservation of wild birds.  We spoke about birds.  The directive therefore places great emphasis on the protection of habitats for endangered and migratory species.  It establishes a network of special protection areas, including all the most suitable territories for these species.  Under the birds directive, every member state must report on progress to the Commission.  Ireland's last report to the Commission for the period from 2008 to 2012 was submitted in 2013.  The habitats directive covers more than 1,000 animal and plant species.  The Deputy mentioned the Roads Act 1993, under which landowners have an obligation to cut hedges and vegetation on roadsides for road safety reasons.  This legislation has been in force since 1993, that is, about 25 years.  There is a provision under section 8 of the Bill to address conflicts between the Roads Acts and Wildlife Acts.  I agree that our landscapes are a great amenity.  Birds and hedges remain protected under the Wildlife Act.  Under section 22, it is an offence to interfere with or damage a nest in any way.  This Bill limits cutting to roadside hedges.  The Deputy also cites several birds.  I am not sure how many are roadside, hedge-dwelling birds.  Land users also use the roads in the vicinity of their holdings every day.  We need to respect their knowledge and husbandry of their holdings and hedges so ultimately, it is a matter for the farmer and landowner who planted the hedges.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith, Boyd Barrett and Sherlock mentioned bees.  I am well aware of the contribution that bees make to biodiversity.  I would like to make it clear to the House that the regulations that I will make on the cutting of hedges in August will be confined to hedges on roadsides only.  I believe therefore that the overall impact on biodiversity will be curtailed.  Given that flowering is largely over by August, the main forage for bees in August is heather, followed by herbaceous plants such as knapweed.

When Deputy Humphreys developed this Bill, I contacted the Road Safety Authority and asked if the Department talked to it about development of the Bill.  The Road Safety Authority said it had not.  I thought, for a Bill dressed up as being about road safety, that that was an incredible answer.  My amendment No. 20 seeks to address the issues.

If road safety is our intention in hedgerow cutting, let us put the resources into it and do it properly rather than having a free-for-all, which the Minister is allowing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the burning on the uplands, I talked to rangers and asked if it would be okay because I was interested in what was happening up there.  They said that I was fine where I was.  They did not have a particular problem.  I was conscious of safety and not worsening their difficult task but I am afraid the Minister's logic is fundamentally flawed.  It seems to me that she is saying that we want to manage the burning better by extending the season.  This comes after last year, when we had massive wildfires in Galway and elsewhere, which went from bogs on to forest, and burned and threatened houses.  Our problem is that the traditional sense that people want to burn for scientific management of upland moors to get heather growth is not the reality of the world we are in.<\/p><p>We do not even have the farmers, the man and woman power, to manage in that very careful way what such a burning programme would be.  The reality is that we have massive wildfires occurring in March, and to extend the season into that month is going to make it much easier for people to burn in March and for that to be in the public consciousness.  That is what is going to happen.  To dress that up as an advancement of heritage is illogical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300045#SS00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530646800,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1530646800,"counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300046#TT00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1530646800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I wish to share time with Deputies Broughan and Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300046#TT00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1530646800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

There have been many proposals relating to housing since 2011 and we have become a bit blinded by them all, but land banking has not been addressed.  Economists say that since 1950, the 80% increase in the price of housing is linked to the land price and that is a significant issue.  Between 1963 and 1971 alone, there was an increase of 530% in the price of housing and it led to the setting up of the Kenny commission.  Mr. Justice John Kenny was commissioned to examine how in God's name we could control the price of development land.  He reported in 1973.  He recommended that local authorities should be allowed to purchase land compulsorily at the agricultural price plus 25%.  The Government of the day, led by Liam Cosgrave, did not accept the recommendation.  It seemed a bit on the radical side.  It was suggested that it might give rise to problems with Article 43 of the Constitution which prevents any Government from interfering with property rights, but at the same time the advice was that it would not interfere with it.  In 2004, a Fianna F&aacute;il Government set up a committee to examine the same issue and it came to the conclusion that it would not interfere with Article 43.  It was about private property and the constitutional balance.  The verdict at the time was that it would not interfere with Article 43 but nothing was done either at that time.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that in 2006, the National Roads Authority, NRA, announced that 23% of the roads budget at the time related to land acquisition.  That compared at the time with 12% in England, 10% in Denmark and 1% in Iceland.  We knew we had a serious problem but nothing was done at that time either.  If truth be told, since 1973 a total of 13 consecutive Governments have refused to do anything about the situation and ignored the recommendations of the Kenny report.  They refused to examine Article 43 or to test it in the courts.  They also refused the notion of introducing a referendum on Article 43.<\/p>  <p>  The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 was a harmless effort to deal with the problem of land banking.  I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy English, was in office at the time but, as I argued then, it was designed to fail because it was never going to deal with the issue.  I know the Government is making some changes now which are of interest, but I maintain they do not go nearly far enough and they will not be a game changer.  For example, the Minister is talking about increasing the vacant site levy to 7% from January 2020.  First, 7% is not near enough given the price of housing.  If the price of a house goes up 10% at the moment, which we have been looking at now for four years in a row, the price of the land goes up by 30% so a 7% levy will not disincentivise land bankers.  Second, even though the Government is doing away with the exemption on the loan, there are still loopholes that will allow many people to avoid paying a vacant site levy.  The changes do not amount to much.  One of the proposed changes is to give the Minister power to vary the levy rate by way of regulations, having regard to increases and decreases in the CSO property price index.  It goes on to say, however, that any increase in the levy rate above 7% will be subject to primary legislation.  In other words, the only power the Minister will have is to decrease the levy.  The Government is going in the wrong direction.  That will not solve the problem.  We are still going to be left with the loopholes.<\/p>  <p>  I will not have time to go through all the issues but a Ladybird version is that we want to bring in stricter definitions for what constitutes a vacant or idle site because it is way too open at the moment and we need to close it off.  For example, if somebody applies for planning permission and gets it, a commencement notice can be made but building might not start for another 12 months.  Such a person is still banking the land.  Ninety nine out of 100 builders who are interested in building will have organised their finance.  If a builder is still sitting on it a year after getting planning permission, then the Minister will have to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that must be tackled is where a commencement notice is made but a project is not completed within three years.  A builder could get a commencement notice, put up hoarding, dig a few holes and walk away, but that is land banking as well if the builder is not going ahead and building.  There are many different ways of getting around these things and the Government has to deal with them.  I know for a fact that these things happen.  It is a very clever way of getting around some of the challenges presented.<\/p>  <p>  The appeals system the Minister built into the 2015 Act borders on the ridiculous.  Four different forms of appeal are available.  A person could appeal being put on the vacant sites register in the first place.  After 1 June 2018, which has just passed, he or she could appeal it again.  When a valuation was put on what was deemed a vacant, idle site, the owner had the right to appeal the valuation.  If he or she lost that appeal, once the person was asked for the money, he or she could then appeal the payment of it.  It is ridiculous.  I reckon that person could drag out the appeals for at least six years, and there was no backdating of the money he or she had to pay if he or she went down that route.  That is nonsense.  We have done away with three of the appeals and we have left one.<\/p><p>In the interest of fairness to the site owner, instead of one valuation which a person was allowed to appeal under the 2015 Act, I suggest that the average of three valuations be used, which should be sufficient.  It makes no sense to allow four appeals.<\/p> <p> Many issues are dealt with in the Bill.  A report by the National Economic and Social Council in 2016 claimed that only 9% of zoned residential land was owned by local authorities in 2006, whereas in 1970 it was 30%.  That was a major game changer.  Those amassing and holding landbanks filled the gap vacated by the local authorities.  The result was a huge power shift from builders to those holding landbanks.  The person with landbanks became king.  Earlier this week, I referred to a site of one fifth of an acre on Dominick Street which I bought for &euro;4.8 million.  If one buys a site and immediately begins working on receiving planning permission, it normally takes two years before a sod is turned and another two years to build it out, giving four years in total.  Loan interest is usually 6%, which means that the interest repayments on a site costing &euro;4.8 million are approximately &euro;300,000 per year, adding up to &euro;1.2 million over the four years it takes for the project to be completed.  Added to the &euro;4.8 million purchase price, that gives an overall outlay of &euro;6 million.  We built 27 apartments on the site and the land price accounted for almost half the cost of supplying them.  The build cost was &euro;230 per square foot or a little over &euro;200,000 per unit.  The land cost, made up of the initial purchase price and loan interest, was equivalent to the build cost.  That is a mad scenario and should not happen anywhere.<\/p> <p> Many people find the price of housing in Ireland draconian.  In most European cities, one can purchase a three-bedroom house between 20 km and 25 km outside the city for approximately &euro;160,000.  In Dublin, one would pay approximately &euro;320,000, double the European average.  Who benefits from that?  Builders do not.  They will benefit from this Bill but those holding landbanks will not.  More than 99% of the people of Ireland will benefit from the Bill.  Nobody is a winner when housing is ridiculously priced.  It leads to rents being ridiculously priced and is an all-round problem.  It beggars belief that 13 consecutive Governments failed to deal with this issue.<\/p> <p> I appeal to every party in the House which is genuinely interested in dealing with the fact that the manner in which housing is supplied in Ireland is totally dysfunctional, irrational and does not stack up to avail of this opportunity to deal with the problem.  There may be a problem in regard to Article 43 but let us start the process and test it through the courts and, if necessary, a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300046#TT00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530647400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>We learned during statements on child homelessness last week that almost 10,000 people, including some 4,000 children, were homeless in May 2018.  Members are aware that that is the tip of the iceberg because the number of hidden homeless is not recorded.  I have repeatedly highlighted the situation in that regard in Dublin Bay North, the worst-affected constituency in Ireland.  The suffering of homeless citizens and those on housing lists constantly shows that legislation such as that proposed by Deputy Wallace has been needed for many decades.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill would be a powerful deterrent to land hoarding and I commend my colleague, Deputy Mick Wallace, and his staff on bringing it forward.  The Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018 was introduced on 21 June and will amend Part 2 of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 which provides for the vacant site levy and related matters.  The vacant site levy, which is to be charged from 1 January 2019, was originally set at 3% but had a large number of loopholes which enabled developers to reduce the amount of levies owed or appeal the levy.  Deputy Wallace eloquently explained the farcical nature of the appeals system on this morning's \"Morning Ireland\" radio programme.  Section 11 of the Bill will increase the vacant site levy to 25% of the market value of the site and remove the ridiculous exemptions that made a mockery of the levy in the first place.  Three of the four grounds of appeal will also be removed.  <\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Wallace rightly pointed out, the Kenny report was published in 1973 and followed two years of committee discussion during which ten or 12 possible approaches to the problem were considered because the price of land in Dublin had risen by approximately 500% in the seven or eight years prior to 1971.  It recommended that sites be acquired by local authorities for 25% more than the site's agricultural value but that recommendation has been ignored by 13 consecutive Governments.  Had the report's recommendations been adopted it is likely that we could have avoided some of the boom time house and land price rises and inevitable bust and crash.  In 2004, pre-bust and mid-boom times, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution stated that the Kenny report recommendations could have been adopted and that a constitutional challenge to such recommendations would have been decided in favour of the public interest.  It is striking that that has never been put to a constitutional test.  It beggars belief that these issues around land hoarding and stockpiling have bedevilled our nation for more than six decades but the Government still refuses to address them. <\/p>  <p>  It was yesterday revealed that only 6% of local authority owned land is on the councils' vacant site registers and that Dublin City Council, DCC, is due to fine itself approximately &euro;2 million as a result.  Its 21 vacant sites listed on the register could hold almost 2,000 homes and include locations in Ballymun, Inchicore, East Wall, flat complexes and areas in my constituency.  I agree with Mr. Mel Reynolds, a distinguished housing policy analyst and architect, who stated that a significant dent could be made in our homeless figures if these sites were developed.  He also expressed concern at the message the small number of registered council vacant sites is sending to private developers. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, land hoarding, landbanking and speculating on prices of homes and land have been a deliberate Fine Gael policy and follow on from the approach of its Fianna F&aacute;il colleague when it was in government.  Budget 2012 introduced a seven-year relief on capital gains tax, CGT, purportedly to incentivise the market.  Section 604A, inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by the Finance Act 2012, provided CGT relief for properties acquired during the period from 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  After we got into a disastrous housing situation, the 2015 legislation was brought in.  As Tom Healy, director of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, rightly stated last year, land continues to be the dominant factor of production and determining economic interest, while high finance and three-bedroom semis have replaced cattle as significant commodities of interest.  <\/p>  <p>  I warmly commend the Bill and hope it will be passed by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300047#UU00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1530647400,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il chuig an Teachta Wallace as ucht an Bhille seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.  I have no hesitation in supporting the Bill and ask my colleagues in the House, in particular those in Fianna F&aacute;il, which holds the balance as to whether it will be passed, to examine it carefully.  The explanatory memorandum is clear as to the purpose of the Bill, which seeks to disincentivise landbanking and land hoarding with a view to addressing the overall problem of the price of development land.  The main provisions of the Bill, which are clearly set out, are to provide stricter definitions of what constitutes a vacant site, to increase the vacant site levy and remove three of the four appeals allowed under the original Act of 2015 and certain exemptions in regard to the existing levy and, of particular importance and significance, to provide an option for the owner of the site deemed vacant to enter into negotiations with the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot see how anybody could object to the Bill in the context of the very serious housing crisis and the 2015 legislation which has not been implemented.  I understand 11 local authorities were obliged to bring in a register in January 2017 but have failed to so do.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why that has not been done.  I have records pertaining to two Galway local authorities which have vacant registers, including vacant sites, which is very interesting.<\/p><p> The Minister might read the digest on the original Bill.  That Act was brought in when people were saying clearly there was a housing crisis.  At the time, SIPTU referred to a housing crisis.  The ESRI referred to the need to build 18,000 houses a year, and we were down at 8,000 new houses per year.  All of that was highlighted in 2015 and what we brought in then was a very limited Act that was not even implemented.<\/p> <p> In addition, the previous Government, in which Fine Gael was the major party, brought in the 2014 Act, which was subsequently implemented.  That legislation removed the right to own a social house for life, played around with language and brought in a housing assistance payment, HAP, which the Minister of State is now calling social housing and on which we understand &euro;300 million will be spent this year as opposed to &euro;153 million in 2017.  That is what the Minister of State is calling social housing.<\/p> <p> With regard to this Bill and the price of land, this is not new.  Almost 50 years ago, in 1971, the Kenny report was commissioned.  Mr. Justice Kenny sat for more than two years, took detailed submissions and a majority report was presented.  It dealt in particular with Article 40.3.2&deg; and Article 43 of the Constitution regarding personal rights, fundamental rights and property rights.  Mr. Justice Kenny teased out all of that and stated in clear English in 1973 when he published the report that while there is a right to property, when we look at the common good we are not asking to abolish that right but seeking to regulate it, as was done with rented accommodation legislation at the time.  He said there was no obstacle in regard to the Constitution.  In any event, this proposition should be tested because we are in the middle of a housing emergency.  Language fails me when I seek to describe the situation nationally and in Galway.<\/p> <p> I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.  Once again, I thank my colleagues but, more important, I appeal to the other parties in this House.  This is a time to show we can make a change and that new politics works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300047#UU00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530648000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for the opportunity afforded to me to speak tonight about the vacant site levy in response to his Private Members' Bill entitled the Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018, which proposes a number of significant amendments to the 2015 Urban Regeneration and Housing Act which first introduced the levy measure.<\/p>  <p>  While I may not agree with every aspect of the Bill in terms of the key points of concern, which I will touch on later, I believe the Deputy will find broad agreement across the House on the intention behind his Bill, which I gather is to tackle land hoarding and ensure that land is brought forward for housing and other developments.  The concept of having a levy and trying to utilise land is something all Members agree with and want to achieve.  The job we had in trying to achieve that objective in the 2015 Bill was to find something in the Constitution that would create a balance, could make a difference and would force people to use land.  I accept that as the years have passed, we need to increase the levy and that is what we are trying to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill contains some proposed amendments to the existing levy provisions, which the Government is already progressing through a range of legislative reforms.  I take the opportunity this evening to update the House on these reforms and progress with implementing the levy.<\/p>  <p>  As many Members will know, the primary objective of the vacant site levy is to act as a mechanism to incentivise the development of vacant or underutilised sites in urban areas for both the provision of housing and the development and renewal of land.  This is with a view to facilitating the most efficient use of such land and sites and enabling them to be brought into beneficial use rather than allowing them to remain dormant and undeveloped.  In this respect, the Government shares the overall objectives of Deputy Wallace and we want the levy to be an effective mechanism for activating key sites for development and to be responsive to changing economic circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I will first highlight how the Government is already addressing some of the key provisions of the Bill before us.  As Deputies will be aware, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which, among other things, will provide for the establishment of an office of the planning regulator, is currently progressing through both Houses of the Oireachtas and is due back in this Chamber either on Thursday night or Friday to introduce amendments brought in during its passage through the Seanad.  A number of Government amendments relating to the vacant site levy provisions, which were developed in consultation with and on foot of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, were tabled on Report Stage in the Seanad.  Collectively, these amendments aim to further strengthen the levy provisions by increasing the rate of levy from 3% to 7% for sites on the register for the year 2019, as announced in budget 2018.  This will ensure the levy is more aligned with the increase in house price inflation in recent years and, therefore, has a more meaningful impact and is more effective in bringing forward sites for housing development.<\/p>  <p>  It is agreed that 7% will make a fair impact.  It was a figure that others in the House had suggested.  I am conscious Deputy Wallace wants to increase the levy to 25% but there was a view that 7% would make an impact and force people to utilise land.  That is what we are trying to legislate for in the Bill that will come before the House on Friday, which will remove the possibility of applying reduced or zero rates of the levy for sites on the register that are subject to a site loan, taking account of the economic recovery and recent increases in land and property values since the enactment of the 2015 Act.  I am conscious that Deputy Wallace has agreed with that and regards it as common sense.  We are probably on the same page in that regard.  The Government Bill further clarifies the definition of \"vacant and idle\", with reference to vacant sites on residential land, to include sites that are not being used primarily for the purpose for which they have been zoned, that is, for the provision of housing, and where the land was purchased after it was zoned residential, irrespective of when it was purchased.  It provides that the Minister may, by regulations, vary the levy rate within the upper threshold of 7% to ensure the rate can be varied promptly to respond to property price fluctuations, along with enhancing the Minister's general regulating powers to further facilitate the consistent implementation of the levy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with a view to further addressing the broader issue of land hoarding, a number of other amendments have been made to the Government Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas.  I am conscious that Bill has been dragging on for the past two years in these Houses and that people have invested considerable effort in the legislation during that time.  The key amendments in this respect are to provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permission, which would permit such an extension only where substantial works are carried out during the initial duration of the planning permission and allow for a maximum of two extensions of the duration of a permission, the combined extent of which would not exceed five years.  These amendments are intended to ensure that planning permissions are activated earlier and that the development works are completed earlier.  We had discussed that concept in debates on earlier planning legislation during the time of the rental sector strategy in December 2016 with a view to trying to bring forward initiatives that would deal with developers who were sitting on land and had not brought it forward.<\/p>  <p>  We look forward to engaging in more detail on these amendments at the end of this week when we finish the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 in this House, or bring it close to finishing, along with other important amendments.  There are approximately 82 amendments to be discussed on Friday and next week, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated, there are some elements of this Private Members' Bill on which I must indicate serious reservations at this stage, primarily relating to legal and constitutional issues.  The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 is framed in such a way as to strike the right balance between ambition, in terms of achieving the common good objective of securing the development of urban lands for housing and regeneration, and the concerns and interests of individual property owners and their constitutional rights to private property, which cannot be underplayed.  Therefore, to ensure the legislation is reasonable and proportionate to the aims of the levy measure, and to protect it from risk of successful legal challenge, the levy provisions as enacted, as well as the various amendments being advanced, as I have briefly outlined, contain necessary features which set the levy at a reasonable but not excessive rate.  They also provide for appropriate notice to landowners to take action before becoming liable for the levy and appeals mechanisms at various stages of the levy implementation process, in line with the concept of fair administrative procedures.  I am conscious that Deputy Wallace said that the number of appeals available are too many.  However, some years ago, in order to ensure the legislation was constitutionally sound, great efforts were made in the wording to make sure it would be effective, would be used and would not be subject to legal challenge that would defeat its usefulness.<\/p>  <p>  In light of these principles and the previous legal advice received, there are significant concerns about the constitutionality of specific provisions of the Deputy's Bill, which propose to dramatically increase the levy from 3% to 25% of the market value of a site, remove the important and fair appeals provisions in particular circumstances, and facilitate the purchase of vacant sites deemed suitable for housing purposes from site owners for not more than 60% or 40% of their market value in specified circumstances.  Taking account of previous advice, these provisions are likely to be considered to be excessive, unreasonable and in conflict with the constitutional provisions relating to individual private property rights.  In effect, these proposals, if introduced, would weaken and undermine rather than strengthen the legislation and would probably be found unconstitutional by the courts.  That could then have far-reaching implications for the concept of the levy and any actions arising.  I do not believe that is Deputy Wallace's intention.  His intentions are genuine, but we need to safeguard robust and proportionate measures against perhaps desirable but unworkable and counterproductive reforms.<\/p><p>I recognise that the Deputy is genuine in what he is trying to do and many who will support him are of the same belief.  As a Government, we try to bring in legislation that is balanced and that would be successful if it were legally challenged.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding these significant concerns, in light of the fact that the Government is addressing some key elements of the Bill through the amendments outlined, we are not intending to oppose the Bill at this stage.  If the Bill passes Second Stage this evening, it will have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny and I expect that these constitutional and legal implications will require further detailed examination and likely significant amendments before it can be advanced for Committee Stage consideration.  Either the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, will address some of these other elements later in the debate.  We are prepared to let the Bill go to Committee Stage and to tease out these issues.  None of us has the divine right to all the information on this.  We are happy to have it teased out but we do flag our concerns.  They are the same concerns on which we took advice back in 2015.  I was not in this role at the time but I am conscious that the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, had to go to great lengths to get a Bill that would be useful and would help all of us in our aim to make sure land is activated, especially land that is zoned residential and that is badly needed for housing purposes.  The Government's legislative reforms in this area are scheduled for discussion later this week.  I look forward to engaging with colleagues on them this week and next week if need be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300048#VV00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530648600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Casey, O'Loughlin, Brassil and MacSharry.  I commend Deputy Wallace on bringing forward the Bill.  To answer Deputy Connolly's query, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill.  It is an important step forward.  There is no doubt in my mind or my colleagues' minds that land is being hoarded.  It is a major issue, as the Minister of State will also agree.  Land is overvalued in many parts of the cities.  It is being purchased by some of the bigger players that have come into the market at 35% over open market value.  Deputies will know who I am talking about and I am sure the Department does as well.  It is a big issue.  We had a debate a couple of weeks ago in which we talked about the State and how it can utilise the land it holds to drive others to move land.  We have 3,008 ha of zoned, serviced land owned by the State, State agencies and local authorities that could be developed for housing.  It is a major issue in our city.<\/p>  <p>  We have to increase the vacant site levy.  I do not think 7% is going to cut it.  It is not a disincentive.  We need a bigger stick to make some people move on these sites.  Although 25% might seem heavy-handed, if a reasonable timeframe and lead-in were given to a penalty like that, it would be justified.  There are issues we would have to consider on Committee Stage, such as the 12 month planning permission limit.  If someone were to submit a commencement order, would it be 12 months after the commencement order?  If they were to submit a commencement order four years after gaining planning permission, planning permission would be staying live for five years.  We have to look at these elements to see how we could work it into the system.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware that there are many aspects of this housing crisis.  We have to ensure that affordable homes are built and that people can aspire to owning and living in their own home with a mortgage that is not going to cripple them.  The issue is acutely visible in Dublin.  They are holding land and controlling large parts of the market and the city.  They know how many houses to release in any given year, although not everyone who is in the market is doing this.  We also need to ensure that some of the smaller players - some of the indigenous Irish small builders - get back into building homes and smaller developments.  We are overly dependent on four or five big players.  If one or two of them were to decide not to budge, as they are backed by significant capital resources, we would have a very big problem and would continue to see double digit growth in land and house prices.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Government will not oppose the Bill.  We also checked this Bill as Deputy Wallace brought it to our attention last week.  We had a look at it from a constitutional perspective and our legal advice is that it is not unconstitutional and does not conflict with the property rights in the Constitution.  The Government can bring in a levy or penalty for a corporation that is profiteering in a market.  At the end of the day, the people who pay for that are the potential homeowners and those who are stuck in a rental market that is out of control, not just in Dublin but also in many of our urban centres.<\/p>  <p>  This is very welcome legislation.  There are certainly aspects around the 36 month completion limit.  If there are good reasons for things to happen, for certain utilities, wastewater or whatever, we have to make sure we are not tying people's hands and that there is a reasonable approach.  Thirty-six months on completion of certain phases would be fine.  Deputy Wallace was in the building game long enough and knows what I mean about issues arising from time to time in dealing with some of the State utilities.  In broad terms, I welcome the Bill.  It is a good discussion to have and I would like to see it move on to Committee Stage quite quickly.  I do not want it to be another Bill that is accepted on Second Stage and dies on the vine.  I think the Minister of State would agree that the vacant site levy provisions brought forward in 2015 have not worked.  I am not sure increasing it to 7% will work either.  We have to look at how we can better use the vacant sites register.  The appeals mechanism in place is overly generous.  I agree with Deputy Wallace on that.<\/p>  <p>  There are very good aspects to this Bill and certain parts we would like to discuss in greater detail on Committee Stage.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting it on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300049#WW00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1530648600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Wallace on his genuine and practical knowledge and views on the land speculation element of our wholesale housing crisis.  Land hoarding and speculation were significant factors in the housing bubble that occurred a number of years ago.  I thought we had all learned the lessons that were so brutally exposed when the crash occurred ten years ago.  I know that Fianna F&aacute;il has learned them and I know that Deputy Wallace has.  I am confident that the people have.  This Government, however, seems indifferent to the hoarding that is taking place while the price of building land rises day after day.<\/p>  <p>  The vacant site levy as structured will not work.  Sufficient lands are not being developed for affordable homes to be built and the penalties for land hoarding in the midst of a housing crisis are not strong enough to change the behaviour of those who own these lands.  There is a wealth of international evidence on the housing problems in other western nations that proves beyond any doubt that Government needs to have oversight on development lands.<\/p>  <p>  The reluctance of various Governments to implement Mr. Justice Kenny&rsquo;s report has been due to a valid concern over the constitutional implications of Article 43 of our Constitution which outlines the rights of private property owners.  The great financial crash of 2007-2008, however, and its ongoing roll-out is catastrophic proof that elected Governments on behalf of their people must prevent profiteering on development lands.  In that regard, it is useful to look at what Article 43 states.  The first part of Article 43 outlines correctly that private property rights exist in our law and must be protected by the State.  We seem conveniently to forget, however, the second part of this article, which is so important and clear that it deserves reading.  Article 43.2.1&deg; states: \"The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.\"  Article 43.2.2&deg; states: \"The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.\"  In black and white, in Irish and in English, our Constitution clearly mandates Government to control property rights under the principles of social justice and the common good.  Social justice and the common good are everlasting values of every democrat and indeed are the core values of those who regard themselves as republicans.  The disease that is destroying our free market system, not just in Ireland but internationally, has been allowed to fester because of a failure of elected and sovereign Governments to legislate and enforce laws under the principles of social justice and the common good.<\/p><p>This article and our Constitution recognise that property rights are not absolute.  The need for affordable homes to be built for people is the definition of \"the common good\" and indeed is one of the defining social justice issues of our age.<\/p> <p> This Bill is an effort finally to address the unjustified and immoral speculation and hoarding of lands and I am glad that my party is allowing it to continue to Committee Stage.  Of course, this Bill will need to be amended and yes, it may be open to constitutional challenge but the duty of this sovereign Parliament is to give expression to the common good of the Irish people.  There can be no more hiding behind vested interests and their legions of lawyers.  Governments are accountable to Parliament, Parliament is accountable to the people and the people are protected by our Constitution.  I believe passionately that now is the time for our democratic system to defend the right of Irish people to a roof over their heads.  I thank Deputy Wallace for providing a foundation for dealing with this part of our housing crisis and I look forward to seeing this Bill in committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300049#WW00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530649200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I also welcome this Bill put forward by Deputy Wallace and welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  I am fully supportive of my party's decision to back this Bill.  For many years, the political system has grappled unsuccessfully with vacant sites in terms of incentivising people who owned zoned land to develop that land.  That is something this Bill very much tries to grapple with.  There are many aspects of the Bill that I believe will bring about significant and positive improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue concerns vacant houses.  According to the last census, we are looking at 200,000 unaccompanied and unused houses in the State.  The Government has tried various measures such as the repair and lease scheme, which is something I greatly supported.  A tax-free loan of &euro;40,000 was offered to people to do up their properties and give them back to the local authority over a ten, 15 or 20-year period.  For whatever reason, there has been no uptake.  I find it difficult to understand because I would have thought that if one incentivises people to do something, they will do it but for whatever reason, it has not worked.  I think we need to look into that and try to find a resolution because if we could get even 10% of the 200,000 properties turned over in a very relatively short period of time, we would go a long way towards solving much of the emergency housing difficulties we have.  Thinking about what has worked and what has not worked over time, one thing that has always seemed to work is providing some sort of tax incentive to property owners to develop or do up property.  It might not be the most popular option, particularly among my left-wing colleagues, but at the end of the day, tax incentives do seem to bring about the required result.  I think it is something we might look at.  Equally, we could look at a tax penalty for those who have vacant houses and allow them to be left unused and continue to build up to that stock.  In his deliberations over this particular Bill, I ask the Minister of State to look at that issue as well and to try to come up with some incentive that will get those who own vacant properties to do them up.  A tax incentive is something that should be looked at in great detail.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps some sort of tax initiative to encourage those who own vacant sites to develop them could be considered.  In the 1980s and early 1990s when there was nothing happening in the property market, the section 23 initiative worked very well until it was over-used and abused but if we could control such initiatives and maximise them, there is something in it that can work very well.  I believe there is investment money out there and there is certainly the capacity in the system to take the development so I ask the Minister of State to consider those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300050#XX00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1530649200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Sad to say, Ireland's housing and homelessness crisis has almost become one of those apparently unsolvable problems that we hear about every day.  It is frightening to think how normalised hearing about men, women and children who have no home to call their own has become.  Lest we as a society become immune to hearing the stories that I hear every day in my constituency of Kildare South, and I have no doubt every public representative hears the same stories in their own constituencies, I believe our housing crisis should be declared a national emergency.  While I believe priority should be given to those who currently do not have housing and who are trying to get on the housing ladder, we must bear in mind the impact of the crisis on the drive to attract foreign direct investment, especially in the light of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2014, 350 families were homeless, yet today, a mere four years later, the number is almost 2,000.  This is going to increase not just every year, every month or every week but every day.  We must boost social housing supply.  On average, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power, 4,700 social houses were built every year.  In the first three years of the Fine Gael-led Government, an average of 413 social houses were built.  Much of the blame regarding why there has not been more social housing seems to be put on the local authorities.  My definitive understanding, certainly in Kildare, is that the Department is just not approving social housing projects for local authorities and voluntary housing bodies.  It is just tied up in red tape and bureaucracy.  The fact that public procurement takes two years within the Department is a scandal.<\/p>  <p>  However, this cannot just be about social housing.  We cannot allow home ownership become the sole preserve of a few.  Every hard-working family deserves the chance to buy its own place and to make a home.  We cannot allow that dream to fade away because families and communities will suffer as a result of that uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad my party is supporting this Bill.  There are a number of elements we must put in place in terms of making sure we have a viable supply of housing and this is certainly one of them.  Strengthening the vacant site levy system is vital to ensuring we have a vital and functioning housing market.  The current system, which has a number of loopholes, is clearly not working.  The fact that a significant amount of State-owned land is on the register underlines the need for the State to launch an effective affordable housing scheme on its own land.  We must ramp up the vacant site system, which appears to be ineffective, and set out new tools to incentivise development and curb land speculation.<\/p>  <p>  Since coming to power, Fine Gael has launched six separate plans.  That does not even count the numerous re-launches of those six plans.  More housing plans have been launched by Fine Gael than the number of actual social houses built in 13 local authorities last year.  House building numbers are tens of thousands behind what was originally claimed.  Government figures overstated completions by nearly 60%.  We must support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300050#XX00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1530649200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Wallace for bringing forward this Bill, which can be another cog in the wheel with regard to trying to solve the housing crisis.  The housing crisis has many facets and many issues that are blocking potential solutions.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing in the market will ultimately be the long-term and effective solution.  Strengthening the vacant site levy system is vital to ensuring we have a functioning housing market.  The current system will not work as it does not penalise land hoarding effectively.  A significant amount of State-owned land is included on the register, which underlines the need for the State to launch an effective, affordable housing scheme on its own land.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly believe that this crisis will not be solved without a hands-on approach from Government.  Up to now, the Government has launched scheme after ineffective scheme and handed them to others to implement.  This has not worked.  The Taoiseach must get his hands dirty if we are to resolve this crisis.  The Minister and his Department must be proactive in creating policy and also working to ensure that policy is implemented.<\/p><p>This problem cannot just be handed to the market to resolve as the market has failed up to now to make any impact whatsoever.  This is one of the key areas where my party and Fine Gael differ.  We understand what is required to solve this problem whereas it is one of Fine Gael's major failures after eight years in government.  The solution is a hands-on approach from the Taoiseach and his Government to build social housing, to make affordable mortgages available to low and middle income workers and to ensure there are affordable houses available for them to purchase.  These measures would take the pressure off inflating house prices for those whose income allows them to access mortgages from our high street banks.<\/p> <p> The vacant site register has a number of loopholes and has not acted as an effective incentive to motivate development despite having been in effect for six months.  This Bill will increase the vacant site levy to 25% from 3% next year.  It will redefine and expand the criteria under which a site may be included on the register, including sites with permission unused after 12 months or a commencement order uncompleted after 36 months.  It will empower local authorities or State agencies to purchase lands under the vacant site levy at 60% and 40% of their value.<\/p> <p> The housing crisis and the way it is being handled portrays Fine Gael's values in government since 2011.  It is aloof to the needs of ordinary people and just does not understand what it will take to solve the problem.  The Taoiseach, in particular, displays no empathy whatsoever with the homeless.  He has no empathy for those who are living in rented accommodation, with the cost of rents rising and no hope of a social house.  He has no empathy for our middle income workers who cannot access a mortgage, and if they did, there is no house out there they could afford to buy.  The reason he has no empathy is that he just does not understand the needs of the ordinary people of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300050#XX00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530649800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who is sharing time with Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300051#YY00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530649800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group, I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing the Bill, which we warmly support.  What is important about this debate is that it addresses problems with the private housing market, which are, of course, the price of houses and the rate of supply.  Whenever the Government is responding to these issues, it keeps telling us that supply is the answer and if it can just get the private sector to build more units, that will bring down the price.  That is why the Government policy response is tax breaks such as the help-to-buy scheme, grants such as LIHAF, loans such as through Home Building Finance Ireland, and planning reform.  All of that is about trying to incentivise the supply of private sector units.  The problem, of course, is that this kind of policy is based on a false premise.  The price of houses is not determined by the demand and supply of the houses themselves, as most housing economists will tell us.  House prices are determined by the interaction of the availability of credit to build or to buy and the supply and price of land, as well as labour and materials.  It is credit and land that are the key determining factors.  Our problem in the private market is that land speculation is at the heart of our affordability crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The House should not simply believe me.  Members can listen to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, which has prepared two reports in recent years.  One report in 2016 looked at eight real house building projects in Dublin, in particular the average cost of the land per unit of accommodation, which was &euro;57,000, that is, &euro;57,000 added on to the price of the house.  Last year the society carried out a more detailed study looking at apartments, and the land price per unit of accommodation ranged from &euro;30,000 up to an astronomical &euro;125,000 for developments of five storeys or more.  This problem is even infecting Part V social housing, so we now have the situation, albeit on a small number of developments in Dublin, where the land cost for Part V apartments is as high as &euro;90,000, for example, in Dalkey.<\/p>  <p>  One can see very clearly that speculation in land is driving up prices, in the first instance in regard to private supply but, increasingly, also in regard to Part V supply.  As the Government's policy response is based on a false premise and a misunderstanding about what drives house prices and housing supply, many of the actions it is taking are making the problem worse.  They are increasing house price inflation, making it more profitable for people to landbank and slow down the delivery of units.<\/p>  <p>  What is very important is that it is not just affecting first-time buyers; it is also affecting renters, students and local authority balance sheets.  In addition, it is not just a domestic issue or some odd quirk of our domestic market.  TASC, the Think Tank for Action on Social Change, had a very important speaker, Ann Pettifor, at its conference last week.  She is an internationally renowned economist and campaigner for developing world debt cancellation. She has been doing a great deal of significant research looking at the global phenomenon we are currently experiencing and to which Deputy Wallace's Bill speaks.  She said that what is driving up land costs and house prices across the developed world is a great wall of money.  She quoted figures of somewhere in the region of &euro;390 billion of investment capital that is currently looking for a home.  What it is looking for are safe, high yield assets.  In the absence of Governments being willing to enter into the bond market themselves, this money is being invested in property.  When investors started coming to this jurisdiction, in the first instance they were looking at distressed assets and focused on the portfolios of IBRC or NAMA, both in commercial and residential property.  They are now moving into residential on a new scale, whether it is in terms of investment trusts, student accommodation or what we like to call the public-private partnerships on crack, the enhanced leasing initiative, which the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, was responsible for launching.<\/p>  <p>  What this influx of investment capital will do is further exacerbate the crisis.  Unless real action is taken, the kind of action that is outlined in this Bill, the problem will get worse.  We need a new approach, and Deputy Wallace and others have adequately detailed the value of the Bill.  However, a vacant site tax has to be punitive.  It cannot be fair or reasonable; it has to punish people for speculation.  Whatever the rates, it has to be based on that principle.  It is likewise with the removal of exemptions and the closing of loopholes, but also in regard to creating a situation where there is a real opportunity for the State in areas where it is required to purchase land at a discounted price for social good.<\/p>  <p>  I have no qualms about supporting the Bill.  It is dishonest of the Government to tell us it supports its intentions and will not stand in the way but, really, it will prevent it from ever coming to committee, so we will never have that discussion.  I would prefer it if the Government was honest about that.  Alongside this Bill, however, we also need to see the State stepping up and investing significantly in public land and social and affordable housing funded through the taxpayer.  If we did those two things, we would start to see the kind of difference Deputy Wallace and his colleagues intend with this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300051#YY00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1530649800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the Bill brought forward by Deputy Mick Wallace and I thank him for doing so.  It pains and concerns me to see the very same mistakes being made now which we saw in the lead-up to the horrific economic crash in the years 2007 and 2008.  The housing strategy employed by the current and previous Fine Gael-led Governments has, quite simply, failed.  The real failure, however, was the development of an utterly reckless housing policy, introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il throughout the 1990s and 2000s, which brought speculation, greed and commodification above the basic right to a roof over families' and individuals' heads.  The results of this are now being lived out in the streets, in hotels and in other types of totally inadequate emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently put forward concrete proposals throughout all of these years to protect tenants, public and private, and homeowners.  These proposals have been largely ignored by both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  Given the emergency crisis we are now experiencing, the time for pussyfooting around this issue is over.  Speculation by developers and holding huge land banks all over the country while seeking to make mega-profits need to cease immediately.  The vacant site levy has not worked.  We are told finance is not the problem in building social and affordable housing and, therefore, we require land.  Developers are sitting on this much-needed land.  Deputy Wallace states that increasing the vacant site levy from 3% to 25% would be a game changer.  I agree with this statement.  Let us make speculating on development land an expensive business.  Let us finally put people first.  As long as we continue to view land and housing as a commodity to be bought and sold to the highest bidder, we will continue to have a housing crisis.  It is not good enough.  As I have already said, people must come first.  Housing is a human right.

House price inflation has been at its highest rate in the last number of years, running at 13%.  This year, rent prices are 22% above the peak levels in 2008.  Despite these facts, the Government believes what it is doing is working.  If that means adding fuel to the fire regarding these costs and concerns in the economy, I agree.<\/p> <p> The vacant site levy is simply not working and we need radical change of the sort proposed in the Bill.  Sitting on undeveloped land is completely unacceptable in this day and age.  It is the worst and most harmful type of speculation and Government policy must tackle it.  This Bill is the foundation to do so.  The current levy and the Act, given the range of exemptions therein, do not work.  We heard calls from Fianna F&aacute;il again today to address these issues through tax incentives for developers and speculators.  We have them already in the form of REITS and other structures which are paying an effective tax rate of 2%.  Gaps in legislation allow them to purchase property blocks and sell or rent them at punitive cost.  The rents set are at rates far higher than the cost of servicing a mortgage to purchase the same properties.  We have a pervasive housing system which allows no capital gains tax to be paid by property funds.  They can flip properties after five years without paying any tax whatsoever.  It is not only funds which are involved in this, others are getting involved too, including pension funds, with Irish Life being the latest.  Whereas the previous Finance Act provided that property had to be held for seven years before a CGT exemption could be claimed, this was reduced to four years in the last Act on foot of a proposal by Fianna F&aacute;il.  As a result, a huge amount of property has been flipped tax free in the State.  The beneficiaries escaping the imposition of 33% tax are international investors.<\/p> <p> These tax incentives simply do not work.  They have pushed up house prices and rents and created a major housing supply problem in the State.  We need less carrot and more stick.  We need a punitive measure to ensure the worst type of speculation is no longer tolerated in the State.  This Bill provides the foundation for that and I encourage the Government to state not only that it will not oppose it, but that it will allow it to proceed to Committee Stage.  I ask the Government to cease its antics on money messages and the like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300051#YY00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530650400,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing the Bill, which the Labour Party will support.  We introduced the Social and Affordable Housing Bill in 2016, which also proposed the implementation of the Kenny report but while we received the support of the left in the House at the time, we did not, unfortunately, get the support of Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il and the Bill did not pass on Second Stage.  It contained a number of measures, but a central one was the implementation of the Kenny report.  I support fully the implementation of that 1973 report.  In fact, I was a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution which recommended in 2004 that the implementation of the report would be in accordance with the Constitution.  I note for the information of Deputy Casey that the committee was chaired by Senator Denis O'Donovan, who is now Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Our legal advisor to the committee was Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan, who was then a very eminent senior counsel.  He advised that there was no constitutional impediment.  Deputy Casey quoted some of Article 43, but it is no harm to quote it in full.  It is quite short and I have six minutes left.  Article 43.1 states:<\/p><blockquote>1&deg; The State acknowledges that man [they always said &quot;man&quot; in those days], in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.<br \/><br \/>2&deg; The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.<\/blockquote><p>The provisions of Article 43.1 are balanced in Article 43.2 which states:<\/p><blockquote>1&deg; The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.<br \/><br \/>2&deg; The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.<\/blockquote><p>That is pretty clear.  In any case, the interpretation and recommendation of the all-party committee in 2004 were very clearly that the Kenny report can be implemented.  Now is a time to do so as we are beginning to see the hoarding of land in a really big way again.  It must be stopped.<\/p><p>Other Members have provided many statistics as to what is happening.  Deputy Wallace knows better than most of us in the House the ups and downs of the business and the kinds of things that landowners will do to make more money or to protect their potential earnings.  I refer to the vacant site levy in that context.  It is important to ensure that measures are constitutional because if they are not, one can be sure that people will take cases, in particular people with money and power.  As such, it is important to ensure that what one does is in accordance with the Constitution.  Many people have dismissed the 2015 legislation and the vacant site levy as useless but they had to be proofed against the Constitution.  That is one of the reasons there has been such a long lead-in time.  While the registers have been compiled over the past few years, the levy is not coming in until next year.  I was involved at the time and we were told we had to so provide because of the right to private property in the Constitution.<\/p><p>Deputy Alan Kelly was the Minister at the time and he tried to introduce a higher levy.  Whether it was the Fine Gael or the legal advice, he was certainly advised at the time that he would not get any further with that.  He battled to make it higher at the time and there is a proposal from Government, which I welcome, to make it higher now.  Deputy Wallace's Bill seeks to bring it to a higher level also.  I support that measure albeit we must ensure that it is constitutional.  We have seen people with power and money use the courts in the past to delay things for years.  As such, we have to be realistic.  In saying that, I agree with Deputy Connolly that many local authorities had not compiled registers comprehensively or even at all.  I agree with Deputy Wallace about taking away any loopholes that have been discovered.  Local authorities must put their own land on the registers too.  Certainly, there is evidence that they own vacant sites which they have not registered.  The levy must be effective but I caution that it must also be constitutional.<\/p><p>I have no problem with the two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who are present, but I take issue with the other three who have spoken.  One said, more or less, that only Fianna F&aacute;il knew how to get down and dirty and build houses.  Another talked about how few houses were built in the first three years of the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government.  However, that, of course, was because they were not started under Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Deputies know very well that the number of houses built is the number completed.  They also know very well that it takes approximately three years to get from the start of a project to the end, if not longer in many cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1530650400,"counter":562,"content":"<p>It is longer now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1530650400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, will, I am sure, confirm that I have attended the openings of housing developments which commenced when I was Minister of State in the Department.

In particular, we welcome the proposal to increase the vacant site levy from 3% to 25%.  We also support the removal of the right of the landowner to appeal the valuation of the vacant site as determined by the planning authority.  We support giving the planning authority the power to value some vacant sites at a zero valuation.  Indeed, this is something that should be considered beyond the limited circumstances envisaged in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest hoarder of land in the State is the State itself.  According to research conducted recently by Mr. Mel Reynolds, the State controls sufficient land zoned for residential development to provide more than 114,000 dwellings.  Some 48,724 of these could be developed on lands owned by the local authorities, 65,399 could be developed on lands owned by NAMA and yet, in the middle of the biggest housing crisis in the history of the State, the Government has built less than 1% of this total per annum in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Solidarity has proven the potential for public housing on public lands by publishing detailed costed plans for potential developments at Old Whitechurch Road in Cork, Damastown in Dublin West, Kilcarbery in Dublin South-West and Belcamp Lane, Northern Cross in Dublin Bay North.<\/p>  <p>  In Cork city, there are now 310 hectares of land zoned for residential development in the hands of NAMA.  This is more than 18% of all such lands owned by NAMA in the entire State.  There are a further 41 hectares of land zoned for residential development in the hands of Cork City Council.  In Cork city, 11,350 new dwellings could be built on the 351 hectares owned by NAMA and Cork City Council combined.  Solidarity has shown how the last major Cork City Council landbank at Old Whitechurch Road could be used to build 800 new homes - 600 houses and 200 apartments - at a cost of, say, &euro;150,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and &euro;170,000 for a three-bedroom house, eliminating profit, etc.  Mortgage repayments could cover the cost of 400 affordable homes over 25 years.  Four hundred social homes could be covered by &euro;29 million from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and a sum less than one fifth of the Cork City Council capital programme budget.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of this Bill are modest but they are positive, and Solidarity supports them in so far as they go.  However, only the development of public housing on the vast majority of that publicly-owned, zoned land can bring this housing crisis to an end and our message to the Minister is, \"Get on with the job or get out of office.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300053#AAA00500","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1530651000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Wallace for putting forward this Bill.

Indeed, I tried to do the same with my own motion a couple of weeks ago dealing with different aspects of this same problem.  It is important for the public out there to know, and I hope this debate gets a bit of coverage.<\/p>  <p>  We talk often about the human misery of the housing crisis but what is not talked about enough is the flip-side of the coin of that human misery being suffered by so many of our citizens in which a small group of people are making a lot of money out of it and they do not care about the human misery they are causing.  The more human misery they cause, the more money they make.  The more desperate the situation gets in terms of the unaffordability of housing and rents, the more money they make.  That is the obscenity of the matter.  The Government has not only failed to deal with it, but actively facilitated it.  When the history of this period is written, it will show that following the disastrous crash of 2008, the Government - first of Fianna F&aacute;il but continued by Fine Gael - through the policy of NAMA flogged off vast amounts of land and property assets to speculators who have then speculated on that land, hoarded it and generated the crisis that we now face.<\/p>  <p>  I laugh with despair when I hear the Government talking about how well it is doing.  Boasting about this, they state planning permissions are up by 27%.  Of course, planning permission means nothing other than that the value of that land increases for the landowner.  Landowners can then sit on it and do absolutely nothing with it, and that is what they are doing.  We only need look at Cairn Homes, for example, sitting on enough land to build 12,000 homes, or 20% of the zoned building land in Dublin.  The company built 103 houses in 2016, it built 200 in 2017 and it is talking about ramping up at some point to 1,200 in a couple of years' time.  The company is clearly drip-feeding and speculating on the value of property.  When one looks at what it builds, it is unbelievable.  Albany, in my area, is \"Luxury coastal living\".  Half of it is still empty.  The start price, at &euro;890,000, will really solve the housing crisis for us.  What about Marianella in Rathgar, with the starting price of &euro;650,000 ranging up to &euro;925,000?  Is that affordable?  Profiteering is what these people are doing and yet these guys ran off with &euro;26 million in shares last year and shared out &euro;4.1 million in wages, bonuses and pension payments in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300053#AAA00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1530651000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300053#AAA00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1530651000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>That is what is going on.

I would be worried too when I see the way prices are going, that again it is going beyond the control of working people who want to go away and get a mortgage and have a life along with it.  They should not be stuck with a mortgage whereby they will not be able to afford to do any of the other things that young families might want to do.  During a debate like this it is not helpful to hear people being branded like that.  I do not agree with that.<\/p>  <p>  On what is being proposed in the Bill, I would urge caution again because there are people who might own property and who are not developing it right now.  Punishing people or taxing them to an extreme that forces them into doing something at a time that they might not be able to do it or that it does not suit them would involve legislating for everybody's private business and that cannot be done.  Everybody's personal situation cannot be legislated for in that way.  We cannot paint everybody with the same brush.  Yes, perhaps there are people who were hoarding land to the detriment of the people who we are elected to represent but it is about balance and being prudent.  We have to be careful about what we do when we make legislation to deal with an issue like this.  I appreciate where Deputy Wallace is coming from.  His heart is in the right place and his intentions are good but we have to look at situations such as where I am from where if families want to build a home on their own land to take care of their housing needs, in many cases they are not allowed to do so or there are serial objectors who stop them and sterilise home farms and stop farmers from developing on their own land.

I believe that most people who get up in the morning want to do right and they mean well but I have concerns about putting compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, on land or taking land off people.  I am worried about that because if land was handed down or had to be bought at a high price, it may not be fair to take it off people if the balance is not right as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said.  Developers may not be able to get finance, there may be right of way issues, there could be several things, there could be title issues or there could be many reasons so that is why I would not put my name to a CPO directive to take land off people and hand it on to anyone.<\/p>  <p>  There was mention this evening of 200,000 houses being vacant around the country.  That could be right but they are not in the right places.  There are houses vacant in different rural, isolated places where families will not or cannot go as there is no public transport, facilities or services.  Mention was also made of the repair and lease scheme.  The reason that scheme is not successful is that there was not enough money given to it and because the local authorities could only operate the repair and lease scheme where there was a need for social housing or where there was pressure on.  As far as Kerry was concerned that was Tralee, Killarney and Dingle.  The repair and lease scheme did not apply to all of the rest of the county.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is saying it has so many plans and reports about what it will do and what will be done but I believe that the finance is not there.  Why does the Government not come out straight and say it because in Kerry there are 37 people now who have applications in for rural cottages.  They have the sites themselves.  They will not be considered until 2021, so if people who have the sites and the need cannot get their houses built because the Department will not give the green light to the local authority, that signals that the money is not there.<\/p>  <p>  It is the same with the way demountable homes are being blocked by the Government.  The Taoiseach did not even know what they were but I can tell the Minister of State that I know what they are and the people who are inside them and living in them at present in Kerry want them to be upgraded but they will not get them.  The only people who will get a demountable home now are those whose house gets flooded or goes on fire.  Those are the reasons that have been given by the Department.  That rules out demountable homes altogether and that says to me that the Government just does not have the funding.<\/p>  <p>  To get back to this Bill which proposes to take property off people.  These are human beings as well and most of these people mean well.  We have to look at it seriously.

The State should be heavily engaged in active land management and that means owning, controlling and releasing land for development in a sustainable and planned way.  A recent National Economic and Social Council report, Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure, Fixing Ireland's Broken System, highlighted how active land management in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria has worked in the public interest to limit land cost, improve affordability and prevent price shocks and housing shortages.  It is a no-brainer.<\/p>  <p>  We need urgent measures to deal with land hoarding and this Bill is welcome.  The Bill has a similar approach to parts of our own Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill.  This Bill also sought to eradicate anomalies created in the 2015 Acts that allowed landowners to avoid the vacant site levies.  Our Bill ensured that the levy would apply to sites of any size that could accommodate housing, provide for a vacant site levy to be increased every year that the site remained on the register and provided for the repeal of subsections 16(2) and 16(3) of the principal Act which set down lower or zero rate levies depending on the size of the outstanding loans on the site.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is not radical and we have to ask ourselves what is radical.

A couple of things that were done during our time in government may be useful or additional to this Bill, or may show that it is not impossible to take a different approach.  We introduced and passed a Bill on a supernormal tax on rezoning profit.  It was an 80% tax on rezoning gain, which does not belong to the landowner but to the public decision-making process.  That Bill was pulled by the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government because it was not raising any revenue but of course it was not because in 2011-2012 we were not in the part of the cycle that we are in now.  It was a terrible mistake, and for no good reason, to remove a Bill that went one step towards capturing some of that value.  While I very much welcome the provisions set out in Deputy Wallace's Bill, when we were in government we brought forward the introduction of a site value tax which would also help towards really efficient use of land.  The Department of Finance fought that tooth and nail for no good reason, as far as I could see, other than at the time, back in 2009-2010, we did not know much of the ownership of land.  There was a real problem around landownership particularly in Dublin city because there was not a proper, updated, modern land registry which showed who actually held the title on large sections of land.  We started setting about rectifying that, updating the register and in the transfer to the new Fine Gael-Labour Party Government we pushed the site value option.  It was put in the programme for Government and then abandoned as the Government went for a straight property tax model which was good at raising revenue in the short term but gave us none of the benefits that we could have got in the way of efficient use of the land which a site value tax would bring.  As well as a vacant site tax to tackle the issue of land not being used but hoarded a site value tax still makes real sense.  It makes real sense environmentally because it would push and promote what we need to do, denser development back in the centre and core of the city and it would provide a disincentive for our long-held tradition of spreading ever further outwards, disregarding the cost to the public purse of having to provide ever increasing infrastructure in a more and more dispersed population.  We should reintroduce the tax on zoning profit because that does not belong to the landowner.  As well as the provisions in this Bill, we should consider a site value tax rather than the current property tax and we attitude. We need to stop seeing property developers as the solution to our housing problem.  They are there to work for us not for their own interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300055#CCC00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1530652200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill, commend Deputy Wallace for bringing it forward and confirm my support for it.  As a very young clerical officer in South Tipperary Council County Council in 1973, 45 years ago, I remember the publication of this report.  There was widespread support for it and for its implementation.  Unfortunately the Government of the day and Governments since bent to landowners and now we have the housing crisis that we all see around us.<\/p>  <p>  The differential rent scheme now being operated by local authorities, particularly the scheme being reviewed and operated by Tipperary County Council, is based on section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, which was amended by section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  That section made the making of differential rent scheme a reserved function of the members of a local authority.  That was never implemented despite promises made by the then Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, in 2011 and by the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in January of this year.  Now senior management in councils throughout the country are using the non-implementation of the section to impose savage increases in local authority rent.  That has happened very recently in Tipperary County Council where I estimate the increase in rents will come to in excess of &euro;2 million.  The increases are unacceptable.  Significant numbers of tenants are subject to increases of anything between 30% and 100%.  That is being done by way of changing the method of treating joint incomes of spouses or partners and subsidiary earners, and also carers who save the State millions of euro a year.  They are being assessed on their half rate or full rate carer's allowance and lose one fifth of that income which is outrageous.  The same is happening to those in receipt of family income supplement who are on low pay.  I want the Minister of State to instruct Tipperary County Council to defer these increases and I want the Minister to commence section 31 of the 2009 Act which allowed local authority members, as a reserved function, to have a say in this scheme.  This is an outrageous situation and one that the Minister should deal with immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300055#CCC00300","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1530652200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I had a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>when I first read Deputy Wallace's Bill because it  brought me back to the early days of my predecessor, the late Tony Gregory, when he came into the D&aacute;il.  He was facing what we are facing today, the extent of the land hoarding going on in Dublin city.  It created a major housing crisis.  When he spoke in May 1982 he lamented the fact that the Kenny report from 1973 was still being ignored almost ten years later.  It has been ignored for 45 years.  We know it came out of a crisis which involved a huge increase in the price of building land yet it contained proposals that would have made a difference.  We can only speculate on the differences it would have made today if it had been implemented.  When we ask why we are told that one of the reasons is that it revolves around Article 43 of the Constitution under which the State guarantees to pass no law that attempts to abolish the right of private ownership.  I do not believe that the authors of the Constitution intended protecting the kind of private ownership we are seeing today, the land hoarding, sitting on vacant sites until the market guarantees an astronomical price, the speculating and putting owning one's own home out of the reach of most people, not to mention the disastrous effects on social housing.  When Tony Gregory spoke in the D&aacute;il in 1982 he said that &quot;[t]he speculation and profiteering in building land is a crime&quot;.  He described speculators as &quot;being on the same level as heroin dealers. Both profit from the misery of their victims&quot;.<\/p><p>The sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu <\/i>continues until 2005 when there was an incredible rise in the cost of houses, massive increases in prices, which had spiralled out of control, lengthy waiting lists for local authority housing and a small number of multimillionaire developers controlling most development land.  In 2005 the average price of a house in Dublin was in excess of &euro;300,000.  The term &quot;affordable housing&quot; meant absolutely nothing.  In Dublin we saw the rise in gated community complexes, houses and apartments at very high prices which played a role in furthering social inequality.  In 2006 the average price was over &euro;420,000.  We could be talking about today.  The collapse of the public private partnerships promised so much for the residents of O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and St. Michael's Estate but they were left frustrated.  I acknowledge that the first sod is being turned in O'Devaney Gardens tomorrow morning.  Good complexes have been built in Dublin city, such as St. Bricins, Father Scully House and Peadar Kearney House.<\/p><p>We know that the principal contributory element in the increasing cost of housing is the very high cost of building land.  That is fuelled by owners who are allowed to sit on vacant sites.  There have been too many examples over recent years of what has not worked.  The 3% vacant levy has not delivered the land that is needed.  If something is not working a plan B is needed.  This is the plan B.  It is good that the Bill is moving forward but I hope it will not take a meandering route through various Stages and not see the light of day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300055#CCC00400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1530652200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate on this important Bill and its intent to target the large-scale developers who have been hoarding land yet pay nothing for the privilege.  The Bill will increase the vacant site levy to 25%, remove exemptions that decrease the levy, provide restricted definitions of what constitutes a vacant site and offer the owner of a site deemed vacant the opportunity to enter into negotiations with the relevant local authority or estate agency to sell the site for 60% of its value instead of paying the 25% vacant site levy.<\/p><p> Deputy Wallace is right.  We need to stop developers sitting on land.  That has led to land becoming overvalued, creating a housing supply which does not meet the needs of the population and which has created a homelessness crisis.  It seems we also need to stop the Government, together with the developers, because the Government makes it work for them.  The only way we can do that is by getting rid of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is the only way this will be changed. <\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy English, stated he felt that a 7% site levy was adequate.  From whom did he get that sense?  Where did it come from?  How was it arrived at?  That is what we have to know. <\/p> <p> What has frustrated me the most throughout the housing crisis is that this Government and successive Governments, of which Fianna F&aacute;il was a part, have made it their central policy to financialise housing, which has escalated this mess.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, back in the day, gave a very big welcome to vulture funds and multinational developers coming into this country and made them a handsome profit at the expense of the welfare of the ordinary citizens of the country.  The Government's relationship with developers has been so cosy it has led to developers sitting on land waiting for a handout until they can maximise their profit margins even further and the Government has been more than happy to feed the beast.<\/p> <p> This profit-driven model has been in existence for half a century but was accelerated dramatically when Fine Gael came into power.  Little or no social housing has been built, which fits into its model of the private sector reigning supreme and minimum intervention has since been carried out in the private sector.  Every single housing measure the Government has put out to boost housing supply has utterly failed.  That is because its policies give preferential treatment to land developers and not to ordinary people.<\/p> <p> While the Government has claimed time and again that measures being introduced as part of Rebuilding Ireland would unlock more construction sites to delivering more housing units, this has not been the case after three years and house prices have been increasing year on year.  Not only that but rental prices have been increasing as increasingly, more people cannot afford to buy a house and little or no social housing is available to them.<\/p> <p> Housing is a fundamental right.  People cannot live full lives without it and other rights fail to be realised without housing.  That is the reason I have twice introduced the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill, which includes the right to housing but which was voted down by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government because once again, they consistently prioritised private sector interests above the needs of individuals.<\/p> <p> It is time for the Government to rights-proof decision making and bring the rights of the individual to the core of policy making.  It must build social houses, increase tenant rights, control rents and invoke proposals such as the one Deputy Wallace has presented here today by putting the onus on developers to use land wisely, for the people and not themselves.<\/p> <p> If we make housing a right, which the State then defends, we can prevent the same situation from occurring over and over again by having developers dominate our decision making process and finally we can have a Government that is accountable to the people.  That, however, will not be a Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300055#CCC00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530652800,"counter":596,"content":"<p>The hoarding of land is a long established and very profitable practice in the property development and construction business in this country.  As long as there are big profits to be made, land hoarding will continue.  Land hoarding was recognised as a key factor in driving up house prices going back to the 1960s.<\/p>  <p>  The Kenny report was commissioned and published in the early 1970s and proposed a workable, if far from radical, solution to the problem.  Kenny based his report on a long-established practice in England whereby the Government decided where new towns or estates were to be built, a Bill in Parliament set up a planning commission, the land required was taken into public ownership and parcels were released to developers to build on.  He proposed a version of this system where development land would be acquired by local authorities at no more than 25% above agricultural value.  It was never implemented.  We had the hoary old chestnut about a conflict with property rights in the Constitution.  Yet, Part V measures in the Planning and Development Act 2000 were challenged in the courts and failed.  The Supreme Court ruled Part V measures as being constitutional.  From this, my understanding would be that a challenge to the implementation of the Kenny proposals would also be likely to fail and that it would fail in regard to Deputy Wallace's Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The real reason the Kenny report was shelved was the opposition of powerful vested interests with strong political connections.  A succession of Governments, involving Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and even the Green Party, did not want to know when it came to this issue.  As a consequence, instead of a rational system of development led by planners to meet the needs of society, we had a free-for-all led by speculation and corruption.  Speculators would buy land, usually just above agricultural value and then push for rezoning.  Rezoned land could rise in value by ten times.  Purchasing such rezonings with brown paper envelopes was simply good business.  Corruption in the planning process still continues, as recent events in Donegal and Monaghan demonstrate.<\/p>  <p>  The current vacant site levy will not deal with this issue.  A good question to be asked would be whether it ever was intended to do so.  There has been a very slow response by local authorities in drawing up the vacant site lists in their areas.  South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils have yet to declare any and that is also the case in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  There are too many loopholes and the fee is too low.  It is having no effect.  For example, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, sold land to developers with a potential for 50,000 units but only 3,000 have been built.  There is enough zoned land nationally to build half a million homes but, at the current rate of construction, it will take 100 years to achieve that potential.  There is no urgency on the part of the Government to drive building in a planned way in response to the housing emergency.<\/p>  <p>  The measures outlined in this Bill are a big step in the right direction but to solve the housing and homelessness crisis, we need a complete change of direction.  Housing must be seen as a right, not as a means to superprofits for developers, and in particular, we need cost rental affordable models that would make housing accessible for ordinary people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300056#DDD00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1530652800,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who spoke and Deputy Wallace for introducing his Bill.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, said earlier, while the Government has some differences of opinion and emphasis, it is remarkable that the Government's position on the levy, and its establishment, has been echoed by all those who spoke on the Bill.  There is a significant difference in terms of scale of the levy but I welcome this opportunity to have a discussion on it.  As most Members said, the value of land is a very significant component in the cost of house production, whether it is public or private.  As land is a finite resource, there is an unquestionable public interest in ensuring it is efficiently used, particularly in urban areas but also in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, indicated the vacant site levy was introduced in 2015 with the aim of incentivising the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas for both housing and regeneration purposes.  As a Government, we are open to ensuring that the levy continues to be an effective land management tool.  While the levy has been levied since this year, it will not be payable until 1 January next year.  It would be fair to say, therefore, that its impact would be difficult to measure now but from speaking to a number of local authorities that have put together a register, there has been activity in terms of ownership, planning applications and inquiries about planning applications on sites that are included on the vacant site register.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has brought through the other House a number of reforms by way of amendments to the original 2015 Act to strengthen some of its key provisions that he outlined earlier.  I would have a naturally more hesitant way of approaching some of these issues, but with respect to Deputy Wallace's provision of a 25% levy, most of people to whom I have spoken in the legal profession would say it is in contravention of Article 43 of the Constitution.  The Government's role cannot be to put forward legislation it believes to be unconstitutional.  Through the levy's introduction in 2015 and on foot of it becoming payable from 1 January next year, we will have a standard with which to compare activity in the housing market and the impact the levy is having on it in Dublin and right across the country.<\/p><p>On the amendments that were recently brought through the Seanad by the Minister of State, Deputy English, there was much discussion in the agricultural community around the definition of vacant and idle lands for the purpose of the vacant site levy.  Many family farmers who had operated lands for agricultural purposes before the land was ever zoned, and who never sought for the land to be rezoned, were deemed to be liable for the vacant site levy despite the fact that most people's definition of vacant and idle would not include an active family farm.  By differentiating between lands that were purchased following a zoning change to residential, and lands that were long held and operated as family farms, the proposed amendment will target developers or speculators who hoard zoned, serviced land that has been zoned for residential use.  It would allow farmers who have operated their farm for a number of years prior to its rezoning from agricultural to residential, to continue to operate that farm without liability for the levy.  It is important to point out that if those same farmers wish the land to remain zoned for residential purposes it would fall liable to the levy into the future.  It should not, however, be used and it was never designed to be used, as an instrument to remove families from farms they have farmed for generations.<\/p> <p> I particularly welcome the balanced and targeted amendment brought in by the Minister of State, Deputy English, which brings clarification to the specific point of implementation of the levy, along with the other amendments which further strengthen the levy provisions.  In response to some of Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s points, the Government&rsquo;s amendments include proposals to increase the levy to 7%, to remove the application of reduced rates, to strengthen the Ministers regulating powers generally, and to provide that the Minister can change the levy rate, within the 7% ceiling, by regulation to enable the levy rate to be varied to respond promptly to future changes.  These were matters that Deputy Wallace wanted to see addressed, and we are doing that in a reasonable and legally sound way.<\/p> <p> I must echo the Minister of State, Deputy English&rsquo;s comments regarding serious concerns of a legal and constitutional nature about how this Private Members' Bill proposes to address these issues in a way that exposes the legislation to the likelihood of a legal challenge, which could undermine the entire concept and progress of a vacant site levy.<\/p> <p> Many Members have referred to compulsory purchase.  This Private Members' Bill proposes to facilitate the purchase of vacant sites deemed suitable for housing purposes from site owners for not more than 60% or 40% of their market value in specific circumstances.  There is already a range of State bodies and agencies that have existing compulsory purchase powers for a variety of functions.  These powers are important instruments in facilitating public interest objectives in regard to housing, transport and other areas.  It is fair to say that the existing rules around compulsory purchase often lead to a very cumbersome process that becomes legally embedded in the courts process, which is also a very expensive process.  Many local authorities and other agencies are reluctant to go down that route.  This is why the Government recently asked the Law Reform Commission to conduct a review - the commission has commenced the project - on how best to reform and update the law and procedures around the compulsory acquisition of land.  The outcomes of this review will be considered fully and speedily by the Government.  There is much agreement that the current system of compulsory acquisition belongs to a different era.<\/p> <p> In addition, and as referred to by Deputy Wallace, against the backdrop of the national planning framework, it is proposed to establish a national regeneration and development agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land.  The establishment of this agency was one of the main recommendations in the national planning framework and is endorsed in National Economic and Social Council's recent report, Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland&rsquo;s Broken System, to disrupt the current land market and make better use of State controlled lands to shape the development and revitalisation of our cities, towns and villages.  The agency will work with and support local authorities, public bodies and others to harness public lands to stimulate regeneration and achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.  Detailed arrangements for the establishment of the agency are currently being developed and are expected to be finalised shortly.<\/p> <p> I will now return to the levy itself.  We first need to introduce the Government amendments proposed, and I look for the support of the House in this regard, and then focus on implementation in a clear, consistent and proactive way.  Under the 2015 Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning in January 2017,  and to apply the levy in January 2019.  On foot of a recent review by my Department of the online vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that 14 authorities have populated their vacant site registers to date, collectively amounting to more than 230 individual sites, and the majority of these will be subject to the levy in January 2019.  There are 17 other local authorities that have not yet populated the register.  Those local authorities have members from different groups in the House and they should really get down to it.  Most of the local authorities are involved in that work but they have not yet produced a populated register.  They really need to do this.<\/p> <p> The implementation of the levy is an ongoing process and it is expected that further sites, both in public and private ownership, are being added to the registers as these authorities and others continue their assessment of suitable sites and undertake the necessary preparatory work and procedures set out in legislation prior to putting the sites on the register.  My Department actively engages with local authorities in relation to the levy implementation by providing guidance and organising information seminars.  Most recently, in May, a workshop was held with all 31 local authorities to assess progress generally, to facilitate a sharing of best practice among authorities and to ensure consistent application of the levy across local authority areas.<\/p> <p> We will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  Further guidance and clarification can be provided to planning authorities, on foot of the introduction of the proposed Government reforms.<\/p> <p> Despite some of the concerns expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy English, and me, the Government has addressed some of the concerns in its most recent amendments, as introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy English, and we do not intend to oppose the Bill at this Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300056#DDD00300","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530653400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, that contrary to his assertion, the Government's position has not been echoed by anyone in this House.  It is quite the opposite.  Everyone is saying that the Government is in total denial and if it keeps on this path the housing crisis will get worse.<\/p>  <p>  By my count, since the start of this D&aacute;il just over two years ago, there have been 31 motions, statements or Bills about the housing crisis.  We also had a specially convened Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The issue of housing is raised every single day in this Chamber and yet the situation is getting worse.  The Government seems to think that the measures it implements are helping but everybody else can see they are not helping.  Every citizen in the State is affected by this issue, not just the people who tonight are awake on the streets or those who cannot sleep because they are so worried about having the money to pay rent or whatever.  It even affects the people who are sitting on the property they bought in the 1990s.  They saw the value of their property increase by 431% between 1995 and 2007 but they may have their adult children at home with them tonight, probably with their children too.  These adult children are trying to save for a deposit.  Every single citizen knows that land hoarding is one of the key contributing factors in the lack of affordable housing.  This Bill is an attempt to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  For me this is a crossroads discussion in the House tonight.   We now either move decisively on the issue, which has not been done for 45 years, or we continue as we are.  It is totally disingenuous for the Government to come into the House and say the measures it puts forward are making a positive contribution.  The Government is putting up the card saying that it might be unconstitutional, even though the foremost legal minds have evaluated this aspect and have said it is not unconstitutional.<\/p><p>Even if we did not have that advice and the Government genuinely believed it was right, it would be proposing a constitutional referendum on the issue, it is that important.  It is not good enough for the Government to sit here and pretend we are on the right road when, unless it moves on this, it will only make matters worse.  Land speculation and hoarding are at the core of much of what is wrong with our housing market.<\/p> <p> Also at that core is NAMA's interference.  I will cite a brief example from my area.  A group of individuals had been trying to purchase the old rugby club in Malahide from NAMA since 2015.  They did not want to make a killing on the deal, only to provide for local families, and were willing to pay NAMA above the odds.  The Minister for Finance told us that the lands were part of NAMA's residential delivery programme.  However, those individuals were cut out of the equation and houses are now being developed, with NAMA seeking &euro;700,000 for them.  It is a joke.<\/p> <p> The measure before the House could transform the situation overnight in a way no other could.  I plead with the Government to forgo the nonsense of killing the Bill with kindness and pretending it does not oppose the legislation.  Otherwise, it will do our citizens a great disservice.  They deserve better.  The Government can step back from its position and progress the Bill in a genuine and positive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300057#EEE00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530654000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>My Bill does not deal with compulsory purchases.  Under my proposed arrangement, a developer who was willing could agree a sale with a local authority at approximately 60% of the market value instead of paying the 25% tax rate.  At 50% over two years, it would be cheaper for the developer to sell the property if he or she were not in a position to hold it and pay the tax.  This would have given site owners a way out.<\/p>  <p>  The idea is to stop landbanking by making it less attractive.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan stated that Labour could not achieve a higher levy than 3% because it would have been illegal, but now the Government can achieve 7%.  Explain that.  If 3% and 7% are okay, the principle is the same whatever the figure, so if 25% is illegal, then 7% is as well.  That does not make any sense.  Come on.  The notion that 7% would work is total bollocks.  The average price of a house in Dublin is &euro;357,000.  Let us say that, last year, it was &euro;300,000 before increasing by 10% to &euro;330,000.  However, build costs did not change, which means the land price did, increasing from &euro;100,000 to &euro;130,000, or 30%.  Where is the Government going with its 7%?  It is a waste of time.  No one in his or her right mind will bother with 7%.  Nor will it catch the majority.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, stated his belief that there could be a legal problem with the appeals mechanism.  He mentioned introducing it in January 2020.  If the four appeals were left, it would take only five or six years for anyone who went to the effort - it would pay plenty of people to do it - to get into the net.  That means 2026.  Where will the housing crisis be then?  Let us tackle it now.  We must.  It is the elephant in the room, but the Government does not want to see it and is pretending it is not there. Jesus, it is so attractive to buy these large tracts of land.  NAMA sold 3,800 sites in Cherrywood to Hines, a vulture fund, for &euro;27,000 each.  Hines then sat on them because it did not have to pay annual tax for doing so.  No hassle.  Hines moved the first of those sites at &euro;72,000.  I know to whom it sold them.  It sold the next little bundle for &euro;100,000.  Then it started selling sites for &euro;120,000.  I do not know what it has done with the rest.  It is probably still sitting on them.<\/p>  <p>  We encourage landbanking in Ireland.  Through the policy decisions made in this Chamber, we encourage houses to be unaffordable.  That is a fact.  Thirteen consecutive Governments have refused to deal with landbanking.  We will never have affordable housing if the Government does not deal with landbanking.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, it is not just about supply.  Supply was never greater in the history of the State than it was in 2006 and 2007, yet affordability was non-existent.  Prices went through the roof and reached their highest levels ever.  The idea that prices reduce when there is greater supply does not stack up.  It can happen, but it does not necessarily happen.  There is no rationale behind this.  Look at the history.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons for apartments and housings growing so expensive when they are plentiful is that those who own landbanks will not make the land available until the price goes high, when it will then pay to sell.  They will not do it otherwise.  Over the past six months, I have examined sites in this city.  People are putting a price on apartment sites that a builder cannot afford.  The equation between what a builder is asked to pay and what his or her build, financing, legal and other costs are does not work at the moment.  By the time the builder sells, there is no money in it.  That is why no one is building apartments.  The people who own the land in the private sector have no incentive to sell because they know they will get more for it later and do not have to pay any tax while they are sitting on it and watching its value grow.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government is not getting sites freed up to deal with the housing crisis.  What is it thinking?  This is so frustrating.  If the House did nothing else this year other than deal with the issue of landbanking, it would not solve every problem overnight because Rome was not built in a day, but it was started.  We have not even started.  The Kenny report came up with an idea, but I am not suggesting we use that report, since that will never happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill's measures would have a major impact on and be game changers in how we supply housing, but the Government has to have the appetite to do so.  Stop being afraid of legal types saying this or that cannot be done.  I can understand.  I would say they wore the carpets out in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government when the Government was trying to introduce the site levy.  Let them come.  Let them take their case to the courts.  Let us test it if we have to, but I do not believe for a second that it needs a referendum.  It needs the Government's will to do things differently.  More than 99% of the people of Ireland would benefit from this, but the Government still will not do it because it claims there is a legal issue.  Come on, do the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300058#FFF00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530654000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018: Referral to Select Committee [Private Members]","time":1530654000,"counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300058#FFF00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1530654000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300058#FFF00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530654000,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Heritage Bill 2016: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1530654000,"counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300058#FFF00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530654000,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:<\/p><p>- (Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1530654000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Just before we adjourned, the Minister stated, regarding the decline of the bird population by 28% reported by BirdWatch Ireland, that the EU placed an emphasis on the protection of Ireland's birds.

There is an interesting report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today by Fitzpatrick and Murray, who have published their findings.  In 2006, they indicated, having done a careful study of the bee population, which is difficult, that half of all the species in Ireland were in decline.  They sum it up in one sentence today, that a third of all bee species in Ireland will be extinct by 2030.  They say that some bees are declining so rapidly that we are facing a silent spring of loss.  These are our great unpaid pollinators.  If they go missing, then what?  The Minister said that is largely due to pesticides.  Pesticides play a role but this study also shows that the cutting and abandonment of hedgerows and the flowers that grow in them also play a major role.  I reiterate those arguments.  To respond to the Deputies who spoke here about farmers and how we regard farmers, I think they have an attitude that we are somehow just city slickers who dismiss the concerns of farmers.  Not at all.  I mention the Burren and the exercise undertaken there because they were forced to listen to the farmers and do the sort of things that the farmers required.  It is working.  We need to revert to looking at a different attitude to nature and the environment and to approach the farming community with a clear agenda to enlist them as guardians and protectors of our wildlife, and to ensure that they are adequately incentivised and rewarded for guarding and protecting our wildlife.

She has not done the research and is endangering bird life as a consequence.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Fitzmaurice, I accept the point that people who live and work on the land know much more about these things than those of us who do not.  He should also accept that there is a biodiversity problem which represents a significant danger to everybody, including farmers, and our ability to continue to produce crops and indeed to hold the environment on which all of us, farmers most of all, depend.  There is tension between certain types of land use by certain forms of agriculture and the concerns about maintaining biodiversity, enhancing afforestation, hedgerows and so on.  We need to overcome that tension.  We need to work with farmers to do so and we need to give them supports, incentives and so on to be guardians of biodiversity.  It is not helpful to attack city slickers as people who do not give a damn about the livelihoods or concerns of farmers.  We should not get into that game.

This Bill will not do that but will degrade biodiversity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300059#GGG00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1530654600,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has been in but can come in for two minutes.

I would like to put on the record a statement that I have made before when we talked about the protection of wildlife and the protection of the future of our family farms.  The people who are best able to protect our countryside, who know what is right for land and what is right for wildlife, are the people who own that land.  I know of no farmer who would want to do anything to denigrate his or her farm or the wildlife that lives on it.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to put to bed a couple of bits of nonsense that the Minister and others have to listen to.  With regard to birds and bird habitats, a main reason that we are given why hedges on the sides of our public roads cannot be cut is that we cannot do it during the season in which it is deemed that birds would be foolish enough to put their nests on the side of busy roads.  I have been observing wildlife as much as anybody throughout my life and I have never yet seen a bird be so stupid or foolish that it would want to put its nest on the side of a busy public road.  There are plenty of other places to put a nest.  If people were to come along and cut hedges, they would not do anything on the side of a public road that would bother or interfere with our bird life.  I and others who are involved in farming and represent farmers on a daily basis have the practical common sense of having two eyes in our heads and being able to see what is around us.  That is one thing that I would like to be put to bed.<\/p>  <p>  There is no reason to stop people from cutting hedges on the sides of public roads in the interest of bird life.  That is not true.  It is simply not a fact that birds make nests on the side of the public road where lorries whiz by and buses brush off the sides.  Why would they be so stupid as to do that?  Many politicians seem to jump up and down, saying that one cannot cut any hedge because one might interfere with bird life.  That is an absolute nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  When legislators come into the House, one of the first things they should do is seriously listen to the farming community, the people who own the land and the people who represent the farming community, such as the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, people who deal on a daily basis with farmers and the groups which represent them.  I was very grateful to the Minister, and will be looking for a further written reply, that she was kind enough to meet a group of farmers from Moanveanlagh and other bogs where they were debarred from cutting turf.  They were stopped on a very false premise.  We are looking to get those people back into action, and get them doing what they were good at, cutting and saving turf, and putting fires for themselves, a thing that their fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers did before them.  We want to see them and the future generations being able to cut turf again as they did in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I will be looking for an update on that from the Minister in the next ten days.  The people are looking for an update and it is good for the Minister to know that.  There are traditions in country life that are very important, whether it comes to cutting turf or to this year when people were fortunate enough to be able to save hay.  Despite that we looked for a derogation from the Minister relating to 1 July, we did not get what we were looking for.  At the same time, we tried our best to make common sense prevail.<\/p><p>If the Minister let us down on the first Sunday, perhaps the weather will not now anyway and people will be able to get hay from those grounds on which they were debarred from cutting hay on 1 July.  I have always said that calendar farming is a nonsense because one quite simply cannot have a situation where one can predict what the weather is going to be like and therefore tell people to farm in accordance with the calendar.  One cannot do that.  One could often have a better January or February than July or August when it comes to spreading slurry and other such business.  Those are things that have to be taken into account.<\/p> <p> I was not in the Chamber but I heard Deputy Fitzmaurice's contribution.  I thought it was worthwhile and sound and nothing less than I would have expected from him.  It is nice for people to know what they are talking about when it comes to burning.  It is also nice for them to understand how important burning is and to have a common sense approach.  There are only certain times of the year when one can burn, quite simply because the place will bloody well not burn.  The killing thing about it is that when one does not want it to burn, it will burn and if one wants it to burn one cannot get it to burn at all.  That is the climate we are living in.  People think that we can legislate while ignoring common sense issues such as the weather, the climate and we are living in, but allowances must be made for such issues.  That is why I would like to see common sense prevail.  We went from one extreme to the other.  Hills were overgrown, then completely bare and now they are overgrown again because of people in Europe and various forums making laws when they did not know the first thing about what they were talking about.  If any of them had a bit of practical common sense they would not engage in half the nonsense and rubbish they talk.  More reports are compiled and forums brought together and very little good comes out of an awful lot of them.  All it takes is a bit of practical common sense to know what we need in rural Ireland to survive, to keep places in order and from being overgrown and to make sure that vegetation that should be burnt to allow regeneration is burnt at a time when it can be burnt and not to have some person with a suit telling people when they should try to burn it and when they should not try to burn it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300059#GGG01000","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530655200,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  I wish to address my remarks to Fine Gael.  I understand that in many ways Fine Gael is a farmers' party, in particular of big farmers.  My understanding of farmers, both big and small, is that they are interested and dedicated to the preservation of the wildlife heritage of Ireland.  In all the material and the various videos produced so far for the Government by the strategic communications unit there are lots of overviews of the island and prominent in the sweeping lyrical shots that move in from the Cliffs of Moher and eventually go over counties such as Meath and others is a mixture of fields and hedgerows.  Essentially, our hedgerows are there in place of a lot of the deciduous forests which for various historical reasons we do not have in this country.  I do not understand where Fine Gael is coming from in suggesting that the hedgerows should be endangered and put in peril.<\/p>  <p>  Lots of young people, in particular, respect our environmental heritage.  The people who came and lobbied the D&aacute;il and Seanad on a number of occasions were interested in issues such as pollination and pollinators, insects and birds.  Nobody has made an argument that what is proposed in the Bill will not imperil all of that wildlife heritage that we as a people have inherited and which we should continue to protect.  We should do it for ourselves and for what we have inherited, but if we want to think about money, we should do it to bolster the marking strategy we use for both people in Ireland and those who come from abroad to get them to holiday here.  We should do it because of the way we have branded and marketed food through Bord Bia and other products from cattle, sheep and other animals.  We should reiterate that Ireland is a small island but with a strong appreciation of its wildlife heritage and its heritage in terms of hedgerows.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand to whose advantage this is other than in some narrow way of tidying up the countryside.  The issues concerning potential traffic accidents and the work that needs to be done to provide for road safety have been adequately dealt with and can be addressed via the local authorities.  I am sure the Minister is as committed to heritage and to hedgerows and wildlife as the rest of us and I urge her to think again because once the hedges become diminished and reduced over a period it is too late.  As Members who are farmer will be well aware, what is diminished and reduced is difficult to restore.  We are all familiar with the big machines which scalp hedges so that little or nothing is left and the various species of birds, other fauna, trees and plants that inhabit the hedges will be diminished by being constantly hacked back.  That would be a mistake for Irish people and the visitors who come to Ireland who enjoy the greenness of the countryside, which is a function of the linear system of hedgerows comprising tens of thousands of miles of special ways of natural wildlife.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment we are creating walkways and cycleways all around the country on disused roads and railways lines and we are all taking pleasure in that.  I accept farmers have a living to make and we all know they have it tough but, notwithstanding that many people making the argument in favour of the changes claim they are acting in the best interests of farmers, ultimately those who farm have to be close to the land, close to their animals and they must know they farm it to pass it on to the next generation.  I appeal to the Minister and the Fine Gael Party.  This is a majority Fine Gael Government.  It does not have to listen to other voices.  Most of the Independents in the Government come from the Fine Gael family so they are talking to themselves.  That is all the more reason the Government should ponder whether it should do this as easily as it seems to be doing.  I urge the Minister to think again on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300060#HHH00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1530655200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>In general, in many parts of the country the hedges are much higher and bigger than they were 40 or 50 years ago, or more especially 100 years ago, where every winter they were cut back low.<\/p><p>The available testimony tells us that was the way it was because land was scarce and precious.

Farmers in Northern Ireland are allowed burn until 15 April and, as there is only a ditch between the North and the South, it does not make much sense for farmers here to have to cease by the end of February.  Many Februarys have been wet and farmers could not burn.  Burning is necessary because land becomes overgrown and useless and cannot be grazed by sheep or cattle.  There is great merit in extending burning time to include February or March because there might be a dry spell in the middle of February and one would be able to burn the land one wishes to burn.  We should go back to farmers' former practice of controlled burning.  At that time, Coillte helped farmers.  A farmer would notify Coillte that he or she wished to burn and it would assist the farmer to ensure that the fire did not spread to forestry or other land.  That can be done methodically and carefully by opening a fire vent such that the fire does not travel.  All farmers whose land is prone to burning or whose fire may spread to other land should open fire vents, which is not very expensive.  It could improve matters greatly if controlled burning was carried out and we should be aiming for that.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Bill, the cutting of roadside hedges will be allowed in August, which I very much welcome even though I have always maintained that the cutting of roadside hedges should be permitted all year round for the safety of all road users.  We are told that it is good for our health to walk but those doing so on country roads are in danger.  Some roads are so dangerous that one's eyes might be picked out if one tried to stay close to a hedge on a narrow road in order to avoid being knocked down.  Cyclists could be knocked off their bicycles by briars, etc.  It is imperative that roadside hedges are cut and that roads are safe for people to walk, cycle and drive on.  Many people regularly complain to me about hedges which need to be cut.  They have difficulty passing cars on narrow roads.  A new car costs money and one should not have to run the risk of one's property being scratched or damaged by hedging.  I also receive regular requests for hedges or branches to be cut in order to allow school buses pick up children on country roads.  That is one of the main issues with which local representatives deal.  It is important for the safety of children that a branch or briar does not break the windscreen or side window of a school bus and injure a child travelling on it.  Farmers regularly complain that they cannot get goods or milk lorries up or down the roads to their farms.  Wing mirrors, which may cost &euro;1,000, are often broken.  Parts of the Ring of Kerry are still unsafe for tour buses.  The road is only the width of one bus and buses cannot pass a car where hedges or briars extend into the road.<\/p>  <p>  It is ridiculous that people are stating that the Bill, if implemented, will lead to nesting birds being harmed.  As I put it to Kerry County Council, what bird would be so foolish as to make a nest on the side of the road where the wind from a lorry could blow the feathers off the bird and leave it standing naked in the middle of the road?  It does not make any sense.  I do not request permission to cut the field side of hedges but the side facing the road should be cut, and continually so, for the safety of all road users.  The next thing will be for someone to say that part of the road should be given over to wildlife as well as the side of the road.  The side of the road is part of the road network and should be treated as such.  Local authorities have previously refused to cut roadside hedges because of a law passed by the Oireachtas in approximately 1993, as a result of which the local authorities believe the cutting of hedges is none of their business.  However, if one were to take certain actions beyond the ditch forming the border between one's land and the road, the local authority would not be long in putting a stop to it.  The roadside is part of the local and national road network and should be treated as such.<\/p>  <p>  Another Bill progressing through the House will require motorists to give cyclists 1.5 m passing space.  However, if a cyclist is keeping out from briars, he or she will be closer to the centre of the road, which would mean there may be no space for a motorist to pass on a narrow road, particularly with, for example, a car and possibly a bicycle coming in the opposite direction.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Bill, which is designed to ensure that roadside hedges are cut in the month of August and that farmers be allowed to burn in the month of March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1530655800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I wish to address some points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  This is not a city-against-country scenario.  Last year, however, some farmers, particularly in Galway and Mayo, were accused of starting fires deliberately.  The individuals in question had nothing to do with those fires.  There are records available which prove that they, and others who were questioned, had nothing to do with the fire.  The Irish Wildlife Trust submitted a formal complaint about the fires to the European Commission, as a result of which the farmers were left without money in one of the worst winters in recent years.  Tourists and others expect to be able to hike up mountains in those areas, which is great and to be welcomed, but there should be a consideration of the farmers who were left penniless last winter as a result of the report that was submitted.<\/p><p>We have to work with people and not report them.<\/p> <p> We have to look at the green low carbon agri-environment scheme.  Deputy Smith spoke about the bees.  In that regard, there is an obligation on farmers in GLAS to put out sand.  I do contracting.  I bale for people and they have their sand out in the field, which has actually improved the number of bees.  The problem is that the badgers are coming out, eating the honey and killing some of the bees.  I have seen it.  Farmers will tell the Deputy what is going on but they are doing that.  They are putting up bat boxes.  In terms of the traditional hay meadow, they are cutting fields from the middle out to save wildlife.  All that is helping the biodiversity.  It is very important that we acknowledge the amount of work being done by farmers in all areas.<\/p> <p> In terms of burning, everyone should be clear that we are not asking to burn at this time of year.  Everyone is going on about the current fires but let us not talk about farmers doing that.  It is as a result of someone's carelessness.  No one condones fires or anyone doing anything like that.  We are talking about Connemara or mountain areas in February.  One would not start a fire because it would not take.  It is controlled burning.  It cannot be done willy-nilly.  As I said, the vegetation that grows back is very important.

Not very many were taken but they happen.  However, it is section 22 of the Wildlife Act which protects birds, their nests and eggs from mutilation and injury.  That is the section the Minister reminded Deputies of on Committee Stage in terms of its importance for the protection of our birds.  Since 2015, however, there have been zero prosecutions carried out.  The protection and the resources do not exist to protect our birds.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister has a hectic schedule so I was very interested to hear that she had time to meet a turf cutting delegation courtesy of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae because it is my understanding that BirdWatch Ireland requested a meeting with the Minister to discuss the impact of this devastating Bill and no such meeting was facilitated.  That is highly regrettable.  Since she had time to meet the turf cutters, did she have time to meet the members of the Environmental Pillar and the Irish Wildlife Trust?  I know that BirdWatch Ireland definitely asked her for a meeting and no such meeting was facilitated.  That is a shameful lack of consultation with a stakeholder such as that.<\/p>  <p>  On previous Stages of the Bill, the Minister justified this legislation's expansion of burning into March and Northern Ireland's burning period, which extends to 14 April.  However, what she did not mention is that this situation is currently an unmitigated disaster in Northern Ireland.  In 2017, there were 2,231 wildfires throughout Northern Ireland that the Northern Ireland Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service had to attend, and 511 of those occurred after 1 May.  The Minister kept making that comparison and said that this will be good and that it will stop things happening but despite having that longer burning season, out of control fires have continued to wreak havoc in Northern Ireland.  Changing the dates for burning will not stop out of control fires as controlled burning, as a management tool, is virtually non-existent in Ireland.

The question we must ask ourselves is whether they add to the protection to wildlife.  I do not believe the argument can be made that they do that.  They do the reverse.  We know that one third of the 98 bee species in Ireland are threatened with extinction.  We also know how important the bee population is in terms of pollenation of crops and plants.  I have a very small garden but I deliberately grew plants that attracted bees.  One can see that one can have a very positive impact in very small spaces in reversing the kind of damage that happens as a consequence of pollutants, pesticides, agri-chemicals and so on.  I believe most farmers appreciate the importance of wildlife on the health of land and agriculture but agriculture is having a direct impact on the threatening of the bee population.<\/p>  <p>  I thought I was seeing things when I saw birds' nests in trees close to where I live that are right beside a road.  I was thinking that the birds in Kildare must be terribly stupid.  They do not seem to be that stupid in Kerry where they can avoid making their nests on the side of the road.  To be perfectly honest, I never heard anything so ridiculous.  We should not lecture people about knowledge of the countryside.  One only has to drive along a road to see that birds do not pick and choose where the road system goes.

These are pilot initiatives subject to statutory instruments that will come before the Houses and there will be guidelines.  The Deputy also mentioned Ticknock.  Regrettably, the setting of those fires follows a pattern of fires in uplands close to large urban centres.  We only need look at Manchester this week.

May I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence for a few more moments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300062#KKK01000","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530657000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>The Minister has been begging it for the past five minutes.

In 2008, the Government of which he was a member stopped recruiting NPWS rangers.  This Government is now recruiting rangers.  I stress to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the positive effect of managed burning at the correct time of year is important.  Unmanaged burning results in extensive areas of upland burning for long periods and irreversible change to the habitat.  My Department's NPWS is constantly maintaining and counting species.  We spend millions per annum on our science programme and that is how we know about species in decline.  The reports the Deputy cited are NPWS reports.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae made an interesting point.  Approximately 455,000 ha or 6.4% of the country is covered by hedgerows, individual trees and woodlands.  The birds are still protected.  I assure Deputy Burton that the Bill will not result in the removal of a single hedgerow.  It will allow the trimming of a single year's growth on the road-facing side of roadside hedges.  I agree that our hedgerows need to be cared for and managed and the Bill seeks to allow for careful management of our hedges on roadsides.  The Labour Party supported the Heritage Bill 2016 when it was published and Deputy Burton was a member of the Government that approved the Bill.  We are not scalping hedges and to suggest that is a mistake.  The Deputy should know that we are prohibiting flails and grubbing, which is an improvement.  We also have provided for prosecutions under the Wildlife Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018070300063#LLL00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1530657000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>The majority of farmers in this country are broke.  Only a third of farmers have economically sustainable farms given the way the industry has gone.  Another third have to work outside the farm to make ends meet.  They are broke for a number of reasons.  The main one is that they are not getting paid enough for their produce.  Meat factories and supermarkets are squeezing them.  Another reason is that because of the way the CAP system is built, richer farmers are getting the bulk of the money and farmers are drowning in a sea of paperwork.
