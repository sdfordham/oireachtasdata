Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.

The development of health policy and legislation in this area is a complex undertaking and will, of necessity, take time and it is important that such proposals are built on the foundations of a clear, carefully considered, coherent and implementable policy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[47979\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if approval will be forthcoming for a request for additional funding of &euro;1.8 million for Letterkenny University Hospital in order to enable it to open an additional 20 bed ward and staff it appropriately to address an issue with persons having to wait on trolleys for hospital admission.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I  have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Languages Act 2003 Compliance","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[48193\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his policy in relation to provision of health services through Irish in Gaeltacht areas;

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of orphan medicines, with very small patient populations, and the price barriers for health systems in supplying them to patients, is world-wide.  Orphan product manufacturers have exclusive patents and are monopoly suppliers.  They can, and frequently do, seek very high prices for these products.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments. However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas.  In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 Framework Agreement with industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Criteria which must be considered include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. <\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs.  However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and in such cases this must be sought.  Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought by the company, lengthy price negotiations between the HSE and the manufacturer may be needed. These factors contribute significantly to the length of the reimbursement decision making process.<\/p>  <p>  With the potential costs involved and the competing demands across the health service, every effort must be made to secure the best outcome for the health service and the taxpayer.  This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Maternity Strategy","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[48092\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500068#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding staffing and facilities at the maternity ultrasound department at Galway University Hospital; the complement of staff necessary to provide the services; the vacancies which exist and the recruitment process underway; if women are not receiving scans as a result of staffing issues; if so, the number of women affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services, including anomaly scans.

As of 13 November,  HSE data shows that there was 1.2% or 1,025 less patients waiting on trolleys this year as compared to the same period last year, notwithstanding the increased demand. <\/p>  <p>  In addition several hospitals are showing significant improvement in terms of trolley numbers with HSE data to the end of September showing Mayo University Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and Beaumont Hospital showing reductions in trolley numbers ranging from 30% to 40% as compared to the same period in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Tackling overcrowding in Emergency Departments is a key commitment of this Government and I am happy to confirm that &euro;40 million in additional funding in 2017 has been made available as part of the 2018 Budget to address winter pressures and waiting lists over the rest of this year.  A further &euro;45 million has been allocated for measures to improve access to unscheduled care and other acute hospital priorities in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Some of this funding is already being utilised within the system, with an additional 45 homecare packages and 20 transitional care beds per week being provided for the duration of the winter period.  This funding will allow for patients to return home, or an appropriate community setting, when clinically appropriate, thus helping to alleviate some of the pressures our hospitals are currently experiencing.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding will also be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and moving forward, as part of service planning for 2018.  The Department of Health is also undertaking a Health Service Capacity review in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published before the end of the year, and which will provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm that all Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their locality focussed on planning and escalation preparedness, maintaining patient flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[48187\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action which will be taken to reduce the long waiting times for paediatric rheumatology appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[48095\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500069#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his strategy for the community hospitals in County Donegal and the future development of all community hospitals within the county; his plans for the long term bed accommodation of St Joseph's Hospital, Stranorlar, Lifford Community Hospital and Ramelton Community Hospital in view of the conflicting information provided by his predecessor on 26 January 2016 and the various HSE statements on that matter of long stay beds within these three community hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>While the care delivered to residents in our community hospitals is generally of a very high standard, many of theses services are delivered in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.

The Plan is stimulating job creation and job retention across the region by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, in conjunction with the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support regional enterprise development projects. <\/p>  <p>  The core objective of the Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. The Plan is also aiming to ensure that\u00a0the regional unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. <\/p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing\/engineering and tourism. The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of the Action Plan through an Implementation Committee.<\/p>  <p>  The second progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan, covering the period to June 2017, was published recently and shows that good progress was made. Over 96% of the actions due to be completed or progressed by June 2017 were on track. \u00a0The progress report is available at www.regionalapj.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Since this regional initiative was launched in January 2015, 6,000 jobs were created in the Border region. The unemployment rate in the region has also fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 6.6% in Q2 2017. \u00a0Furthermore, Live Register numbers have fallen in County Cavan by 16.4% and in County Monaghan by 14% in the past 12 months and by\u00a045% and 51% respectively since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. In the period 2014 -2016, Enterprise Ireland\u00a0provided\u00a0over &euro;11m to client companies in Cavan and &euro;8m to Monaghan and has funded six Community Enterprise Centres which provide important enterprise hubs to these counties. <\/p>  <p>  In May of this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a new competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund to assist counties and regions build enterprise capability and capacity.\u00a0 The Fund will support significant collaborative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan continue to provide\u00a0a range of supports for the micro and small business sector in 2017 and beyond through a partnership approach involving the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland. As a &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo;, the LEOs provide advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business.\u00a0A capital allocation of &euro;452,428 was made available to LEO Cavan and &euro;439,001 to LEO Monaghan in 2017 to fund investment in its clients by way of grants and a range of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports, such as training and mentoring. <\/p>  <p>  Progress has also been made by IDA Ireland towards achieving its target of increasing FDI in the North-East region by 30% to 40% by 2019.

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia\u00a0EU\/EEA\/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU\/EEA\/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. <\/p>  <p>  The student contribution charge\u00a0currently stands at &euro;3,000 and applies to all full-time students who benefit under the Free Fees Initiative. However, it is important to recognise that the State pays this contribution (or part of it) on behalf of approximately 43% of undergraduate students as they qualify on means-tested grounds for exemption from the contribution under the Student Grants Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost of the student contribution. In addition, higher education institutions have provisions in place to allow students to pay the contribution in at least two moieties.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department provides financial\u00a0support via the\u00a0student grant scheme which makes means-tested financial assistance available\u00a0to qualifying full-time registered students in higher education attending approved courses in the EU, EEA and the Swiss Confederation.\u00a0Under the terms of the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students on full-time courses who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.\u00a0In 2017 approximately &euro;380m will be invested in student grants. <\/p>  <p>  Higher education is a central part of our plan as a Government to support a strong economy and deliver a fair society. However, there is a significant cost to providing higher education opportunities and these costs have to be met.\u00a0The most appropriate means of meeting these costs was considered by the expert group on future funding which reported to me in 2016. The expert group's report sets out a number of options\u00a0for\u00a0a long term sustainable funding model for the higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  As\u00a0set out\u00a0in the Programme for Government, I\u00a0referred the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations which will\u00a0assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education. This\u00a0commitment is reflected in Budget 2018 in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total\u00a0investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018. This funding is on top of the\u00a0&euro;36.5m that I\u00a0secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018. In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 than in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This additional funding will allow for targeted\u00a0initiatives in higher education including skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the sector. It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500070#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500070#WRE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[48296\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500070#WRE04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a new school (details supplied) in County Cavan; if a timeframe for works has been set out; the date on which works are due to commence; the length of time these works will take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers is currently at tender stage.

Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided by the EU and its Member States reached &euro;75.5 billion in 2016, an 11% increase compared to 2015 levels and bringing it to the highest level to date. This increase took place in a context of worsening man-made and natural disasters, an unprecedented migration crisis in Europe, and a global refugee crisis of historic proportions, with the number of refugees and displaced people reaching 65 million world-wide - the largest number since World War II. These factors led to an increase in EU aid in order to respond to humanitarian disasters, to support refugees and to help developing countries to overcome poverty and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).In 2016, ODA provided through EU institutions, managed by the European Commission, amounted to US$ 15.7 billion, an increase of 14.3% over 2015. More than half of this was programmed with partner countries. Bilateral ODA from the European Commission focused primarily on Eastern Europe (30%) and Sub Saharan Africa (27%), with the Middle East and North Africa being allocated 15%, South and Central Asia 8%, Latin America and the Caribbean 7%, and other countries in Asia and Oceania 3%.<\/p><p>Ireland believes that this development assistance is delivering strong results. For example, because of assistance provided to developing countries by the EU Commission in 2015, over 400,000 people benefitted from programmes to support post-conflict peace building; 5 million women and children under 5 benefitted from nutrition-related programmes, helping to reduce child mortality; 2,600 KM of electricity transmission\/distribution lines were built or upgraded; 10.6 million children were enrolled in primary education and 7.6 million in secondary education; over 8 million births were attended by skilled health personnel, helping to reduce maternal mortality; 4 million hectares of protected areas were managed to ensure biological diversity and to preserve natural heritage, and; 10,000 firms gained access to credit to boost investment and avoid risk. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU development cooperation budget is assessed by the European Commission on an annual basis, and is calculated by attributing our percentage share of the overall EU budget as a Member State to the total EU expenditure on ODA. An increase in the size of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and thus our contribution to the EU generally therefore results in an increase in our assessed contributions. This in turn helps to fund the EU Development Cooperation Instrument, Humanitarian Aid, and the European Development Fund (EDF). In addition, Ireland also supports a number of specific EU Trust Funds, such as that on Africa.  <\/p><p>In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to EU-managed ODA amounted to &euro;182.26 million.Almost &euro;9.13 billion in ODA expenditure was allocated from the EU&rsquo;s general budget, of which Ireland&rsquo;s determined share was 1.613%, or &euro;147.25 million. This is a marked increase on the 2015 figures which show ODA eligible expenditure at &euro;7.41 billion and Ireland&rsquo;s share at 1.28%, or &euro;94.55 million. Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Development Fund in 2016 was &euro;32.76 million. Assessed contributions from Ireland to the EU will continue to rise in 2018, and though we do not know yet what the final figures will be we are expecting another increase. <\/p><p>EU development assistance is subject to various forms of rigorous monitoring and evaluation by a number of different and separate bodies: the European Court of Auditors; the EU&rsquo;s Results-Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system, an external, independent review system; the EU&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit; the European Parliament, and; contributing Member States, including Ireland.  <\/p><p>Ireland plays a full and active part in overseeing EU development assistance, and ensuring that there is effective oversight, accountability, and transparency. In addition, Ireland is a member of the European Development Fund Management Committee which manages this component.Reporting on this, and the other aspects of our official development assistance programme, Irish Aid, will continue to be done to the Oireachtas primarily through the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Public Accounts Committee. In addition, my officials are currently engaging with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade with regards to EU development financing. <\/p><p>In Europe, Ireland engages actively at the political and official levels in discussions with our EU partners and with the European Commission to ensure that our development policy priorities are reflected in EU programmes &ndash; including the targeting of aid to where it is needed most, and the tackling of problems at the root cause. Earlier this year Member States agreed a revised <i>EU Consensus on Development<\/i>which ensures that EU development policy is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and responding to new global challenges. <\/p><p>Discussions are currently underway between Member States on the successor arrangements to the Cotonou Agreement governing Europe&rsquo;s relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific states and Ireland is actively involved in these discussions &ndash; including through participation in the African Union and European Union Summit in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire later this month. We will continue to promote European core values of peace, security, sustainable development, poverty reduction, and human rights worldwide, with the aim of ensuring that no one is left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500071#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500071#WRF02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500071#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[48292\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500071#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the number of sergeants at a Garda station (details supplied) has gone from a total of 12 in 2007 to 2008 to six in 2017; if this number will be reviewed and increased in the interest of the supervision and assistance of junior members of the force which are needed in each district; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[48293\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500071#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an adequate number of sergeants will be provided in counties Cavan and Monaghan to prevent double jobbing occurring in certain stations and to ensure best possible practice for the welfare of persons involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the severe economic crisis in Ireland led to the closure of the Garda College in Templemore in 2010 when a moratorium of Garda recruitment was also imposed by the then Government.

The overall Health budget for 2018 is almost &euro;15.3 billion. The HSE is currently finalising the 2018 Service Plan and will allocate the additional posts in accordance with service demands. <\/p><p>The HSE has been focused on increasing the number of frontline staff over the past three years as the budgetary position has improved and progress has been made in growing the consultant, NCHD and nursing workforce. While there are difficulties in filling posts in certain specialties, including psychiatry, the number of consultants employed in the public health system continues to increase year on year. At the end of September 2017 there were 2,951 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 126 more than the end September 2016 figure and an increase of 666 in the past decade. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly.

The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017. The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts. The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th<\/sup>quarter, following registration.<\/p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident, including psychiatry. The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018.

Extra funding for home care packages and transitional care beds should also further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.<\/p><p><b><i>Shift to Primary Care<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The provision of a new primary care fund will enable a range of initiatives to be progressed in 2018 which will focus on disease prevention and early intervention, particularly through the further development and expansion of GP services, Community Intervention Teams and the recruitment of additional therapy posts and advanced nurse practitioners.  Throughout 2018 there will also be a continued focus on the development of primary care centres and primary care teams.<\/p><p><b><i>Expanding and developing Mental Health Services<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The provision of an additional &euro;35 million for 2018 will help build on the work commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of Community Teams for Children, Adults, Later Life and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services.

This is 103 more than the end September 2016 figure and an increase of over 650 (665) in the past decade.

The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017.  The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts. It is important to bear in mind however that most student nurses graduate in the autumn. The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th<\/sup>quarter, following registration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500073#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Beds Data","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500073#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[48441\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500073#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current bed shortfall throughout the public health system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>Work on the Health Service Capacity Review is continuing to progress.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience. AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. <\/p><p>Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional support is needed in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for a suite of targeted supports, namely:<\/p><p><i>Level 4: Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support<\/i><\/p><p>This level provides access to mentoring for early years practitioners from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.  <\/p><p><i>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grants<\/i><\/p><p>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or minor alterations capital grants for early years settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.<\/p><p><i>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention<\/i><\/p><p>This level provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile. The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE. The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.<\/p><p><i>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room<\/i><\/p><p>This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. It is estimated that pre-school providers may need Level 7 in the case of approximately 1% to 1.5% of all children. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. <\/p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016. The total funding allocated and outturn in 2016 and 2017 to levels 4, 5 and 7 of AIM by my Department is set out below. Funding for AIM Level 6 comes from the Department of Health Vote.<\/p><p>The Inter-Department Group, which developed AIM recognised that it would take approximately three years to fully develop and implement the Model. It is expected that demand for all levels of support under AIM will increase in years 2 and 3 and the budget available for AIM makes provision for this. <\/p><p><table><tr><th>Level <\/th><th>Element

Typically, these workers provide services in rural and less densely populated areas but larger urban centres may also have a cohort of part-time workers. <\/p>  <p>  I note the information the Deputy has supplied in relation to a particular individual and the difficulty that person has had in finding full time employment. <\/p>  <p>  Retained fire-fighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training, subject to the usual qualification conditions in relation to means or social insurance contributions.  They are, also required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of being available for and genuinely seeking full time work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 carried amendments to both jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis. These amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by this group, particularly in rural communities where the fire service is almost exclusively staffed by retained personnel. <\/p>  <p>  This legislation provided that when a retained fire fighter is on call this will not result in a disallowance for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment on grounds of availability.  It also provides that retained fire fighters are exempt from suffering a loss of a day of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for any day of firefighting employment.  Finally, the legislation also provides an exemption for retained fire fighters from having to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation and associated regulations outlined above allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the jobseeker schemes given the unique circumstances of the service they provide their communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500075#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health and Safety Regulations","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500075#WRK04300"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[48341\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500075#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the laws or guidelines which exist for employers in relation to the safety of their staff during a status red weather warning.","asker":"1333","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>Occupational Health and Safety is the policy responsibility of my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. <\/p><p>Policy responsibility for 12 pieces of employment legislation transferred to me pursuant to the <i>Labour Affairs and Labour Law (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2017 (S.I.

This includes undertaking overseas Peace Support Operations, and in this regard to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on all missions. <\/p><p>The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement directives, including the Directive on the procurement of Defensive and Security Equipment. Details of tender competitions can be accessed on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website <i>www.etenders.gov.ie . <\/i><\/p><p>Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions. In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.<\/p><p>The matter of barring companies or countries from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit. <\/p><p>Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. <\/p><p>The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargoes. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect. <\/p><p>As I outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question Number 62 of 17 May 2017 regarding the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) currently operated by the Defence Forces, 4 UAV Systems were procured between 2007 and 2009 from Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd based in Israel following a competitive tender process. An upgrade of the Defence Forces UAV systems was carried out by Aeronautic Defense Systems as the original equipment manufacturer in 2016.
