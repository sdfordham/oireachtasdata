Given the times we are living in, I understand why he is seeking an update, so I will outline my understanding of what is happening.  Arrangements have been made to dispose of the remaining approximately 50 acres of the Magee Barracks site by public auction on 11 February this year.  An auctioneer has been appointed to manage this disposal on behalf of the Department.  Given the strategic location of the barracks site, the sale and development of the site is very important to the long-term development and prosperity of Kildare town.  Part of the original site has already been redeveloped to provide a new school for the community and I understand that local development plans for the site have made provision for a wide-ranging use of the site, including substantial community amenities, thereby ensuring that the local community will benefit directly from the sale.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin Heydon and I met a number of people in the town who were concerned about the future of the site.  We had a long discussion about its disposal.  I understand that there was an idea that we would give a segment of the land for community use, but there was no real plan or understanding as to who would manage that and pay for it and as to why one would separate out ten acres and then sell the rest.  The best use of the site involves ensuring it is sold as an entire lot in the context of a local development plan as agreed by the local authority in order that we get a co-ordinated and balanced development in the heart of Kildare town which adds to it.  Given the dereliction of the site in recent years, it is now time to move on to ensure there is a positive new chapter for Kildare in terms of the use of these 50 acres.  I am glad we are able to help to move that process forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600004#B00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453817400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that it is certainly time to move on.

Will he honour the commitment that was given by successive predecessors of his since 1998 that ten acres or the value thereof would be given to the local community?  That was a written commitment made at the time of closure by the then Minister, Michael Smith.  It was supported by successive Ministers until the Minister's immediate predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, took over.  During the term of this Government, the Department of Defence has refused to concede the commitment that was made in writing to the community of ten acres or the value thereof.

I would ask the Deputy who is looking for ten acres in terms of taking ownership, paying for the running of it and ensuring the development of a proper amenity area or parkland or whatever the community may want.  Surely the sensible approach is to ensure any developer who wants to develop the site pays for that.  That is the whole point of having a local area plan.  Where one has a local area plan for the 50 acre site. setting aside ten acres and having a different management and financing structure for them will lead to a very unco-ordinated development of the site.  I have thought about this.  We are not looking to make a lot of money.  We are looking to ensure this is developed in a way that is consistent with what the community wants, which is determined by the local area plan of Kildare County Council.

It is not solely about a military response; it is also about diplomatic responses, education and understanding international humanitarian law and its consequences for conflict management, post-conflict management and so on.<\/p>  <p>  It also involves things like gender-based violence, where Ireland can develop niche capacity internationally and help others to build capacity.  Out of all of the recommendations in the White Paper, I am probably more excited about the establishment of a peace and leadership institute than anything else.

This will not be a western institution working on its own.  It will, I hope, ensure that we have inputs from different parts of the world, whether Christian, Islamic, European, African or Middle Eastern, so that there is genuine input in terms of an international peace and leadership training institute in Ireland on neutral ground, if one wants to call it that.<\/p>  <p>  So far, the engagement has involved universities at home and abroad.

In accordance with the framework for major emergency management, primary responsibility for responding to severe weather events, such as the recent storms and subsequent flooding, rests with the three designated principal response agencies: the relevant local authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  In accordance with agreed arrangements, all the available resources of the Defence Forces are made available on request to support the principal response agencies.  At national level, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are represented on the Government task force on emergency planning.  This ensures the fullest co-ordination and co-operation in the event of an emergency.  The major emergency plans that have been deployed by local and regional authorities identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.  The role of the Defence Forces in these circumstances depends on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested.  In November 2015, each local authority was reminded of the range of capabilities the Defence Forces can bring to emergency responses.  They were also advised of the local call-out arrangements.  The call-out procedure provides for contact with the Defence Forces 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  During the recent period of severe weather from 4 December 2015, the Defence Forces responded positively to all requests for support received from all three principal response agencies.  Most requests were received from local authorities, in line with their central role in the flood response.  The extent of the support provided was considerable.  The Defence Forces were deployed to multiple locations in counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Clare, Kilkenny, Wexford, Offaly, Tipperary, Westmeath, Limerick, Roscommon and Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600015#N01800","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1453822200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600015#N01900","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1453822200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will come back with the actual number of members of the Defence Forces who were out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600015#N02000","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1453822200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600015#N02100","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1453822200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>It was significant.

If we are learning lessons - there are always lessons to be learned from the kind of experiences we have had over the past two or three months - I would like to see local authorities calling for assistance from the Defence Forces earlier.  There were thousands of local authority workers out manning pumps and helping people to get water out of their premises.  One of the lessons learned is that we have significant capacity in the Defence Forces that is available to be deployed quickly and early.  It should not be seen as an admission of defeat by a local authority to work with significant Defence Force capacity earlier in a crisis.  The local authorities, on the whole, did a really good job given the extent of the flooding.

Lariam is not suitable for some people, so I ask how we ensure those people are not prescribed Lariam and do not go to certain missions that may be in a malaria zone but go instead to another mission that does not have malaria, such as Lebanon or the Golan Heights.

Health care staff, nurses and doctors are literally at the end of their tether trying to keep things together and patients are suffering.  Irrespective of what hospital one visits throughout the country - I was in Drogheda last week - one gets a clear illustration of this.  Waiting lists for routine operations are spiralling out of control and have been for some years now.  Waiting times are lengthening all the time and targets are being breached.  Despite the fact the Government changed the goalposts to make such times and targets more manageable, they are getting worse.  The Government undermined the National Treatment Purchase Fund which had been working very effectively to deal with elective surgeries and routine operations before it came into office.<\/p>  <p>  Our emergency departments simply cannot cope.  Talking to  people in and outside of the hospital in Drogheda where I was last week, this was the No. 1 topic of conversation.  Waiting times for minor operations and CT scans are now the worst in Europe and the same is true of waiting times for emergency departments.  There are 517 patients on trolleys in emergency departments today and operations are being cancelled in these hospitals as a result.  Whether it is the Mater hospital, Beaumont Hospital or Cork University Hospital, they are under enormous pressure.<\/p>  <p>  Most damning of all is that the Taoiseach and the Minister deliberately left the hospitals of this country short of at least &euro;100 million in the health service plan.  This is acknowledged by the HSE on page 90 of the 2016 service plan where it states there is a funding shortfall of &euro;100 million.  It had been &euro;150 million but some cash management shaved off &euro;50 million on a once-off basis, leaving &euro;100 million of a shortfall.  It uses the chilling phrase that one of the options which it can consider includes \"aligning activity levels to the funding\".  That means cuts in capacity in our acute hospitals for 2016.  It means fewer operations and more overcrowding in emergency departments, fewer discharges and so on.  It is incredible that the Taoiseach and the Minister would have approved of this plan, knowing in advance it has left the hospitals short of &euro;100 million.  Why did the Taoiseach deliberately approve this plan knowing that, at a minimum, it leaves our hospitals short of &euro;100 million for 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600017#P01100","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453823100,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for his question.

That is all the more reason that the impact of the spend that is in place should be examined and how capacity can be increased in an effective way to deal with the patients.  While capacity is up by 5% this year, so too is the number of visits and calls to accident and emergency units.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that 1,000 beds were taken out of the system.  There are 750 more nurses and 300 more consultants and doctors employed since 2011.  There is an increase of &euro;800 million in the spend for this year.  I was talking to the Minister this morning.  An increasing number of patients, both adults and children, are presenting with flu-like symptoms.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has reported that influenza-like illness rates for the second week of 2016 are equivalent to the rates reported in mid-February last year and that influenza is expected to circulate for a number of weeks.  There are 250,000 unused vaccines available at present.  People aged over 65 years and people who are vulnerable or who work in the health service should avail of the opportunity to get the flu jab - the Deputy may shake his head if he thinks it is funny - and attend their local pharmacist or GP where it will be made available to them.  There has been an increase of over 10% in the level of attendance by people over 65 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  I also pointed out to the Deputy on the previous occasion he raised this matter that in December 2014, the Minister for Health convened the emergency department task force to ensure that where overcrowding began to occur in accident and emergency units, it would be addressed in a proper, integrated and system-wide way by the hospital groups dealing with the issue in the various hospitals.  In April 2015, the HSE published the emergency department task force action plan with a range of actions that were time defined, such as getting the best out of the space available in hospitals and community capacity and developing internal extra capability and processes to deal with this.  In addition, a sum of &euro;170 million was allocated for that.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Martin knows, without effective reform one can always say there is never enough money.  He knows the process that applies here.  When a budget is struck and agreed by the Cabinet, the HSE submits its programme to the Minister of the day.  The Minister has 21 days to respond and either accepts it or makes amendments to it.  Naturally, the HSE, in addressing the scale of the challenges, will always seek the maximum amount it can get.  As I said, &euro;13.6 billion has been allocated for this year, which is &euro;800 million more than last year.  Capacity is up by 5% but the increased number of attendances obviously creates pressures in accident and emergency units.  This goes back to the point that to deal with these matters in a long-term way, the community and primary care system must be looked at as well as the capacity in hospitals, including the employment of consultants, doctors, nurses and other medical personnel down the line, and one must have the resources to be able to meet that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600018#Q00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1453823700,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has great difficulty answering the question he was asked.

Demographic changes will see the population increase by 1% in 2016, an increase of 32,000 people.  The over-65 age group is expected to increase by 3.1% or 19,400 people.  This is setting the scene for its revelation that it is &euro;100 million short.  It is a &euro;100 million shortfall before the plan even starts.  The plan goes on to outline the implications of that on page 91, that is, providing inpatient services and inpatient activity at 2015 levels.  This is at the start of 2016.

The Government promised that a minimum of 1,000 new social houses would be built in 2015.  While that would have been welcome, even though it is a paltry number, relatively speaking, given the gravity and depth of the housing crisis, the target is not going to be met.  Instead, the latest figures provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government show that a mere 28 local authority houses were constructed in the first nine months of 2015.  That is 28 homes when children are growing up in hotel rooms, more than 5,000 citizens are in homeless accommodation, including 600 children, and more than 100,000 applicants are on waiting lists for local authority housing, including 5,000 in my constituency.  Let us be straight about this.  It is the policy of the Government not to build social and affordable housing.  The Government's record is clear.

The Government has responded in a number of ways as I have pointed out to the Deputy before, including by providing proper accommodation for people in units that were neglected, closed up or uninhabitable, significant numbers of which have been brought back into use and allocated to families.  The social housing strategy for 2020 sets out clear and measurable targets to increase the supply of social housing to meet the housing needs of all householders on the social housing list.  The intention and the objective is to deliver 110,000 units through current and capital funding streams between now and 2020 to 2021.  In regard to putting together a strong house building programme, the Government has put &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money towards the social housing strategy out to 2021.  In 2015, 13,000 units were delivered across all the social housing programmes, representing an 86% increase on the 7,000 units delivered in 2014.  That is because of the total collapse of the construction sector over a number of years, of which Deputy Adams is very well aware.  The target for this year is to deliver 17,000 units.<\/p>  <p>  In the period 2011 to 2014, 26,000 new social housing units were delivered for families and people who needed them.  The Deputy is aware of the housing assistance programme and the tenancy supplementary scheme, which has helped another 10,000 people to stay in the houses they have been in.  The Government has sanctioned 400 additional local authority posts to help build capacity in order that local authorities can get back to building houses.  In that sense, we have also introduced a new one-stage approval process for projects up to &euro;2 million in value involving up to 15 new houses.  Ordinarily, new housing construction projects go through a very extensive multi-stage approval process.  This new opportunity allows for a much faster delivery between concept and construction.  The Government has also worked closely with the representative bodies for the approved housing bodies sector, the Irish Council for Social Housing, the National Association of Building Co-Operatives, SHS oversight and so on.  We have also approved the first bundle of public private partnership projects to deliver 500 units at six sites in the greater Dublin area.  These are all elements of the challenge.  There are quite a number of sites nationally at which work is going on at this very moment to deliver 926 social housing units, some of them in Deputy Adams's own constituency.  I see from the list that most counties and areas are covered and construction is actually under way now.  We need to get back to a point where local authorities use direct build methods to build these houses.  The Government has provided them with the money, targets and facilities to get on and do that.

An amazing array of launches and events is being held not just in Ireland, but also abroad, by a wide number of organisations.  A number of restorations are ongoing, for example, Kilmainham court and Pearse's cottage.<\/p>  <p>  It appears to me and others that this and previous Governments would have preferred it had the men and women involved been airlifted from the GPO to Richmond Barracks and Kilmainham Gaol, thereby bypassing Moore Street.  However, they did not bypass it and it is part of the evacuation route.  It was also witness to a number of events not just involving the leaders in Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, but the ordinary men and women who took part as well as citizens in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Shaffrey Associates conducted a wider assessment of the 1916 battlefield as part of the ministerial consent to carry out work.  I will cite parts of that assessment.  The block exactly matches the terrace into which the majority of the GPO garrison escaped.  The activities relating to the 1916 Rising that took place on Moore Street happened throughout the entire street, on adjacent lanes and within many of the buildings.  The assessment specifically mentions buildings other than Nos. 14-17.  Furthermore, Article 1 of the Venice Charter states: \"The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting.\"  Article 6 states: \"Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept.  No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and colour must be allowed.\"  To me, this means that the fabric of Moore Street and its area must be retained.<\/p>  <p>  If one walked into Kilmainham Gaol or Pearse's cottage or if one went to Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, one would immediately get a sense of what it was like to have been there at the time in question.  This is what we could have at Moore Street.  Last week or the week before, the Taoiseach launched a virtual reality tour of Easter 1916.  I do not want that to form part of what we will do for Moore Street when we have the opportunity to retain the authenticity of Moore Street now.  Westport House was withdrawn from NAMA.  Under section 4.1.1 of the NAMA Act, that was possible for legitimate reasons in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600020#S01200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1453824900,"counter":193,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600020#S01300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453824900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Government had the power to designate Nos. 14-17 Moore Street as a national monument.

As I understand it, the maps and other documents show clearly that buildings on either side were either non-existent or in a state of collapse before the Rising took place in 1916.  The Deputy is right that this was the centre of the end of the evacuation process from the side door of the GPO, in that the several hundred who evacuated the building were not in a position to go up Moore Street because of gunfire from the top of the Rotunda.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan knows that what the Government wants to do for the people here and for posterity is to take the buildings where the surrender was commissioned and preserve them as a national monument in respect of one of the first small countries to strike out for independence, politically and economically, at the start of the 20th century, but the Government does not own all of the streets and the buildings on either side of Nos. 14-17.  The Government does own, in respect of the people now, these buildings and the intention is to have these restored in a proper and fitting fashion.  It is not just a case of the vulture capitalists, venture capitalists or capitalists doing what they like in respect of the remainder of the surrounding area.

The occupation should never have happened, but what occurred that Monday was disrespectful, undignified and insensitive to what happened in Nos. 14-17.  It was cloak-and-dagger stuff and no conservation expert was on hand to oversee the work.  Someone happened to arrive along and heard workers using claw hammers.  I mean no disrespect to the workers, but they did not know where they were, what they were doing or the significance of the building.<\/p>  <p>  The reports contain many mistakes.

The work is based on a very specific and sensitive plan.  There are some elements inside the buildings that are genuinely authentic and that can be restored or reproduced to give a feeling for the colours and materials that were evident in the houses.  There are other elements that are not in this category.  I can arrange the meeting for the Deputy so that she may see for herself the professionalism of the proposal.  Perhaps she does not agree with me.  Believe me, it is not a case of a subcontractor moving in and saying he believes we should do this or that.

That meeting dealt with several issues of importance to the Union, with a particular focus on the complex challenge of migration.  Also discussed at the meeting were the report of the five presidents, Completing Europe&rsquo;s Economic and Monetary Union, and the UK plans for a referendum on its EU membership, and it was agreed in both instances to return to the issues in December.  The French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, made a presentation in advance of the global Conference of Parties on climate change in Paris, and the European Council noted the publication of the international and independent report into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  On Sunday, 29 November, EU Heads of State and Government held a meeting with the Prime Minister of Turkey.  Co-operation with Turkey is central to the European Union&rsquo;s overall approach to tackling the migration crisis, and the meeting agreed a joint statement along with the European Union-Turkey joint action plan which had been negotiated by the European Commission over the previous weeks.  The statement noted the European Union's agreement to provide an initial contribution of &euro;3 billion over two years in support of the 2.2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.  Member states including Ireland will contribute to this fund once the final arrangements have been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The statement also committed to strengthening relations between the European Union and Turkey, addressing common challenges through more structured, high-level dialogue and re-energising the accession process, on which the European Commission published its annual report on 10 November.  The issues of visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens and border security, both of which are mentioned in the statement, are for Schengen member states to consider in the first instance.  The action plan is intended to further support refugees and their host communities in Turkey and to strengthen co-operation in preventing irregular migration.  Both the European Union and Turkey have set out their intentions under the plan, which includes financial support, resettling of refugees from Turkey to the European Union, law enforcement co-operation on smuggling, joint return operations, an improved legal framework, and compulsory registration and integration measures.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the commitments made by Turkey and the European Union in the joint action plan will have to be fulfilled.  Progress on this is being very carefully monitored and will be reviewed by the European Council in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The shooting down of the Russian aircraft was not discussed at the European Council meeting in November.<\/p>  <p>  I had no scheduled bilateral meetings in the margins of the meeting of European Union Heads of State and Government with the Turkish Prime Minister on 29 November, although I did, of course, have informal exchanges with a number of colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  I last met Chancellor Merkel at the December European Council meeting.  While I engaged with the Chancellor in the course of the Council meeting, we did not have a formal bilateral meeting.  I did not raise retroactive recapitalisation of the Irish banks with her or with other counterparts at that meeting.  I last held a formal bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel during my visit to Berlin on 3 July 2014, following her own visit to Dublin in March 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government's proposals for EU membership were discussed most recently at the December European Council.  This provided a welcome opportunity to have a collective discussion of the issue with all 28 EU Heads of State and Government and the Presidents of the EU institutions, framed by the earlier exchange of letters between the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk.  At that meeting, Mr. Cameron opened the discussion by outlining the four broad areas where he is seeking change and by explaining the complex domestic politics around the issue in the United Kingdom.  I intervened in strong terms in the subsequent discussion to present the Irish point of view, which is, of course, well known to this House and in the United Kingdom and other member states.  I spoke about the importance of the issue to Ireland, given the uniquely close political, social, economic and cultural ties between our countries.  I also emphasised the significance of UK membership to the European Union as a whole and I stressed the importance of working together to find a mutually acceptable solution.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the proposals themselves, Ireland is supportive of moves aimed at delivering more for our citizens.  We share the United Kingdom&rsquo;s enthusiasm for sustained effort under the \"competitiveness\" heading.  The issues here are the drivers of long-term prosperity for the citizens of the European Union.  Under the &ldquo;economic governance&rdquo; and &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; headings, although the details of the proposals remain to be clarified, we can also see where solutions might lie.<\/p>  <p>  In the immigration and free movement area, we can more than likely support the proposals, subject to the details, in regard to addressing fraud and abuse and changing the way in which child benefit is paid abroad.  The idea of limiting access to in-work benefits is more difficult, and there is opposition to the proposal in its current form.  However, I am hopeful that, with willingness and determination, a workable solution in this area can also be found.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the debate itself, I was encouraged by the substantive and very constructive exchange of views about the four categories of reform proposed by Mr. Cameron, including the difficulties.  There can be little doubt that this is a challenging and sensitive issue, but the atmosphere at the European Council meeting was very positive and there was willingness to find a way forward.<\/p><p>Prime Minister Cameron, while not withdrawing his proposition about limiting access to in-work benefits, signalled his openness to alternative ideas that would have the same effect.  We agreed, therefore, to work closely together in the period ahead, with a view to reaching agreement on a package of measures at the February European Council meeting.  While the legal form and implications of the final package remain to be teased out, I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is not pressing for early treaty change.  We now await the emergence of detailed proposals from President Tusk, which are expected in early February.  These will allow all member states to develop further their responses under each of the four headings and participate in intensive and collective preparatory work at senior official level leading up to the next European Council meeting, which I understand will take place on 11 February.  The aim is to secure an agreement that is acceptable to all of us and will allow the Prime Minister to recommend and campaign vigorously for a vote to remain in the European Union.<\/p> <p> I met Prime Minister Cameron again in London yesterday and we had a further excellent discussion about the state of play.  He updated me on his recent contacts with colleagues and I confirmed our strong support for a positive result.<\/p> <p> This issue has implications for all parts of Government policy.  The whole of government has, therefore, been engaged in tracking the development of the debate and framing our contribution to the negotiations that are under way.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs have particular responsibilities in this respect, as do other Ministers in relevant sectors, supported by officials across Departments.<\/p> <p> In addition to the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union, the ongoing migration and refugee crisis was the main item of discussion at the December European Council.  Heads of State and Government took stock of what has been done so far and looked at further shaping and implementing a comprehensive EU approach.  There was consensus that, while important agreements were reached over the course of 2015 to establish a comprehensive response to the crisis, implementation of the measures, notably as regards the so-called hotspots, relocation and returns, has been far too slow.  The European Council agreed that member states and the EU institutions must work together urgently to address these deficiencies in the system.  Work on this is being progressed by the Presidency, the European Commission and the High Representative, who will report on progress at the February meeting of the European Council.  Regrettably, however, in the month since the December European Council, the position has not improved and the urgent need for progress is more marked than ever.  Building on earlier conferences and summits, the European Council also emphasised the importance of working with regional partners in the western Balkans and Africa.<\/p> <p> Ireland has consistently called for an approach which addresses the root causes as well as the humanitarian challenges at European level.  As I observed at the December meeting of the European Council, our immediate priority is to implement the resettlement and relocation proposals under which we have offered to accept 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees.  In this context 176 Syrian refugees have already arrived in Ireland under the resettlement programme, with an additional 120 refugees due to arrive soon.  While progress on relocation has been much slower, I am pleased that the first group of Syrian asylum seekers - a family of ten - arrived here recently under the relocation framework.<\/p> <p> Our decision to opt into the relocation and resettlement programme last year was in addition to the substantial additional financial support Ireland has provided towards assisting those affected by the Syrian crisis, the World Food Programme, to which we have agreed to double our allocation in the years ahead, and the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, as well as the support provided by the Naval Service to humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, of which Deputies are well aware.<\/p> <p> The migration crisis will be a major ongoing challenge for the foreseeable future.  I hope real progress will be made in the coming weeks and I look forward to discussing developments again with the other Heads of Government at the February European Council meeting.<\/p> <p> As I noted, much of the Council's time was spent on addressing the migration and refugee crisis and the EU-UK negotiations.  However, a number of other agenda items were also discussed.  Most notably, the European Council considered actions in the fight against terrorism, building on the decisions taken at its February meeting and in light of the appalling attacks in Paris and elsewhere.<\/p> <p> As outlined in my detailed statement to the House last week, there was also discussion of international developments, including the position in Syria, Ukraine and Libya, respectively, and a number of economic and financial issues, taking stock of discussions on the five presidents' report on economic and monetary union and developments in the Single Market following publication of the new strategy.  Energy union and a forward-looking climate policy were discussed, following the very successful COP21 summit in Paris last year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600021#T02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453826100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who is substituting for Deputy Gerry Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600022#U00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453826100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>As this is my first time substituting, I will need some guidance on timing and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600022#U00300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1453826100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>It is Question Time, which means Deputies should put questions.

I refer first to the proposed referendum on a British withdrawal from the European Union, also known as Brexit.  Following the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Cameron yesterday, he expressed the view that all of Britain's demands for reform of the EU could be solved and referred to a number of these demands in his response.  The next meeting of the European Council will take place on 18 and 19 February.  The December European Council set itself the explicit objective of securing an agreement on mutually satisfactory solutions.  The British Prime Minister indicated previously that he hoped to reach a deal on Britain's membership of the EU next month, which would clear the way for a referendum as early as this summer.  However, in his remarks yesterday, Mr. Cameron seemed less sure of this. <\/p>  <p>  It is not necessary for me to outline the consequences of a British exit from the European Union for Ireland, especially the North.  For eight decades, we have had a physical border between the two States and an economic, social, cultural and political border which has been the source of enormous dislocation and, at times, conflict.  The Good Friday Agreement transformed the position, however, and the physical Border has become all but invisible.  Nevertheless, much work remains to be done on the economic and political barriers between the Twenty-six Counties and Six Counties.  Any move towards Brexit would be a retrograde step as it would create the potential for a return to border controls, which would have a highly detrimental impact on the economy of the Border counties.  The adverse effects of a Brexit on the all-Ireland bodies established as part of the Good Friday Agreement also need to be taken into consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership should not determine the fate of the North in respect of these matters.  Has the Taoiseach sought an assurance from the British Government that the outcome of the referendum in the North alone will determine the relationship between this State and the Six Counties?  The Taoiseach referred to some of the areas on which he believes compromise could be reached.  Will he elaborate on these matters?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also referred to the refugee crisis and indicated that the discussions at the European Council meetings in Brussels in October, November and December, respectively, were very much focused on the issue of refugees.  <\/p><p>I take this opportunity to commend the work of the Naval Service, which successfully rescued a staggering 8,631 people during its humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015.  The extraordinary loss of life as refugees flee violence, war and poverty in the Middle East and north Africa has shocked and saddened all of us.  Last year, 3,770 men, women and children died trying to cross the Mediterranean.  We also saw the images of the three-year-old child on a Turkish beach.  I acknowledge the tremendous work that the naval vessels carried out.  There are no naval vessels in the region at the moment.  Traditionally, the winter months see fewer refugees trying to make the dangerous journey.  Unfortunately, some are still trying to make that journey.  At least 43 people, including 17 children, drowned only last Friday when their boat collapsed off the Greek islands.  According to the International Organization for Migration, over 100 refugees have drowned since the start of the year.  That is more than the combined totals for January 2014 and 2015.  It is estimated that almost 37,000 have arrived in Italy and Greece since the beginning of the year.  There is no doubt we are seeing an unprecedented growth in the number of refugees trying to cross the Mediterranean.  Are there any plans?  When is it planned to send Irish naval vessels back out on humanitarian missions?  I wish to come back in later, a Cheann Comhairle, because I have some other questions, but I know Deputy Martin is keen to get in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600022#U00500","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453826700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for his questions.  With regard to the Brexit business, I never understood why the title is as it is because British exit is not a positive term, if I can put it that way.  It is actually a choice being made by the British electorate.  I have heard some comments from the MP, Mr. Dodds, and the Northern Ireland First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, with regard to comments I made in London yesterday.  I am very much aware that the decision is one for the British electorate, for those in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.  However, it is not the same as the referendum on independence in Scotland because this country has an interest in it.  It is a critical decision to be made by the British electorate in respect of the European Union, Britain and Ireland in the context of our relations with Northern Ireland.  Deputy O'Brien has pointed out some of these details.<\/p><p>Far be it from me to try to direct the British electorate or the electorate of the United Kingdom as to what way they should vote; it is their choice and their decision.  However, it is important to note that there are significant numbers of Irish citizens living in Britain.  Owing to the common travel area, many of them have been there for many years.  Therefore, we have an interest in this.  It is also important to note that &euro;1 billion in trade is conducted across the Irish Sea every week.  Britain is the biggest purchaser of food from Ireland, as we are of their produce.  Many other issues arise from a common travel area.  While we cannot direct the electorate on what to do when they go to vote, it is important that we set out how critical is this issue.  I repeat that it is not for me to direct the British electorate, but it is important to state the importance of the decision to be made.  People should be properly and fully informed.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Brien pointed out a number of issues about cross-Border bodies and so on.  For instance, we agreed fully that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should give the Northern Ireland Executive the right to reduce corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland to something approaching or the same as the corporate tax rate here.  That would make the economic entity of Ireland, from a foreign direct investment point of view, an island attraction in its own right.<\/p><p>To be honest, following the discussion I had with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, yesterday, I am unsure whether it will be possible to conclude this set of agreements at the February meeting.  There is progress to be made on all of the four issues.  Progress can be made and I believe the matter can be concluded successfully.  The UK Prime Minister has made it clear that it is his call regarding when he chooses to have a referendum.  He said that if the deal is not clear enough or strong enough, he has time and can wait until some time before the end of 2017 to have a referendum.<\/p><p>The European Council is where leaders discuss concessions, changes or reforms.  We all support the Single Market, the digital market, getting rid of red tape in administration and the development of trade links with TTIP and other locations throughout the world where opportunities exist.  It is important that all of Europe would benefit from the changes and reforms that are being made here.  It is not a case of saying that we have considered all of this and we give particular concessions to any leader around the table.  We are members of the European Union.  I would like Britain to continue to remain a strong and central member of that because of the power and the opportunity that comes from having 500 million people in a trading bloc with enormous potential.<\/p><p>I cannot say to Deputy O'Brien that it will be finished by the February meeting.  Mr. Tusk, the President of the Council, will circulate his paper next week.  It will deal with the discussions that have taken place following the December meeting, at which the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, tabled his four baskets, as it were, the issues of sovereignty, competitiveness, welfare and so on.  In the meantime, we will continue to discuss the issue with colleagues in Brussels and Britain to see what progress might be made.<\/p><p>This is connected with the migration issue as well.  Let us suppose the current numbers were to continue and the UK held a referendum on continued British membership of the Union in June or July.  That is the time of year when numbers would be heaviest, if migration continued across the Mediterranean.  It is a matter for the British Prime Minister when he wants to call the referendum.<\/p><p>The refugee crisis is taking up practically all the time at the meetings.  It a really complicated and serious issue now.  We get reports from the EU High Representative, Ms Mogherini.  Some 1.2 million people have gone into south Lebanon, 25% of the Lebanese population is now Syrian and 1.2 million are in Jordan.  The Prime Minister held a special event for the King of Jordan in respect of the camps there.  The Union responded with a &euro;3 billion initial fund in respect of Turkey, which has a little over 2 million refugees.  Obviously, the numbers are exceptionally difficult to pin down.<\/p><p>A great deal of work needs to be done from a European point of view on these hotspots in respect of registration and what we do if people turn up to the hotspots where people are registered and identified.  Are they to stay there in camps that the countries concerned provide?  Are they to dissipate throughout the countries of the Schengen area?  These are extraordinary challenges.  Yet, as Deputy O'Brien has pointed out, when we see the pictures of grossly over-laden and overloaded dinghies, ribs and other craft, we can see for ourselves the scale of what is involved.  Let us imagine all of Connacht and all those right down through Munster to Cork walking to Dublin and trying to cross the Irish Sea in rickety boats or whatever.

He took 14 questions on the European Union together.  In his reply he said he had not raised the issue of retrospective recapitalisation with German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the European Council, despite the fact that in 2012 he and the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, were very clear that a game-changer of a meeting had occurred and that retrospective recapitalisation would apply to Ireland.  At the time, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, claimed they could get up to &euro;6 billion back for Ireland through retrospective recapitalisation.  Given that the Taoiseach did not raise the issue with Chancellor Merkel or at the Council meeting, is that the final confirmation that the issue is off the table as far as the Government is concerned?  Is it the case that the Government is no longer seeking a retrospective recapitalisation deal in respect of Ireland's bank debt?  Can he confirm that in a later reply to me?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the refugee crisis, it is accepted that the vast majority of refugees are leaving war-torn Syria and other locations because of conflict and war and because they want to seek a better life.  I refer to the strengthening of relationships between Turkey and the European Union, notwithstanding the curbs on press freedom and the emergence of a more authoritarian regime in Turkey.  What is the state of play in regard to the relationship between Turkey and the European Union in terms of its long-running application for membership, and the nature of the agreements that have been arrived at on the refugee crisis?<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that the most effective way of dealing with the refugee crisis in the short term, apart from dealing with the source of the conflict in Syria and resolving the issues there, is to provide substantial resources to the refugee camps?  The Taoiseach mentioned the major camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.  Improving the quality of life for those in the camps in terms of education, work and so on could potentially stem the flow of migration to Europe.  Nothing is available to assist in improving the quality of life for people in those camps.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said the refugee crisis had dominated the Council meetings.  The recent rapes of and attacks on women in Cologne caused a lot of concern and distress.  Was the issue raised at the meeting?  Did the Taoiseach have any briefing on this and the potential implications for the process of integration and fully teasing out and evaluating the immigration crisis as it hits Europe?  There are many far-reaching issues.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the proposed referendum on whether Britain should remain within the European Union.  The Taoiseach used a wonderful phrase, on which I commend the civil servants involved.  He said the Irish point of view was well known in terms of the importance of the issue and the significance of Britain.  I am not so sure it is well known, and I do not think the precise or specific details of the Government's view on the specific proposals that the British Government is putting on the table have ever been spelt out.  In his reply, the Taoiseach referred to competitiveness, governance and sovereignty, immigration and free movement, welfare, in-work benefits and so on.  What exactly is the British Government seeking in terms of welfare proposals?  Is it solely concerned about welfare fraud?  Is it looking for different rates of welfare to apply in host countries or for the welfare rates in one's own country to apply if one migrates to another EU country?  I refer to EU citizens.  What are the proposals around free movement across the European Union?  The Taoiseach mentioned that in-work benefits would prove to be a difficult issue to resolve.  Can he outline what exactly the British Government is looking for in that area?  What are the potential implications for Irish citizens working across the European Union if the British Government gets its way on that?  Can the Taoiseach outline specifically what it is looking for?<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach indicate specifically whether the British Government is seeking an accommodation for the City of London in terms of eurozone policy and access to the decision-making process within the eurozone area?  Is it seeking an input into decisions that the eurozone would quite properly take for the eurozone area?  The Taoiseach referred to his meeting with the British Prime Minister yesterday.  Did he discuss the issue with him?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said the Irish Government was in broad agreement with the British Government on competitiveness.  Have labour laws, labour market flexibilities and workers' rights featured in his discussions with the British Prime Minister, or is the British Government raising those issues on the agenda of the European Council and seeking changes to existing labour market rules and regulations?  That is probably enough for the Taoiseach to be getting on with at this stage. <\/p>  <p>  I note the Taoiseach's comment that the legal form of the agreement is to fall short of treaty change, which in itself has implications for what is ultimately agreed.  Notwithstanding the comments of Nigel Dodds, MP, and others, we are members of the European Union and therefore have every right to be involved in discussions when an existing member of the Union seeks to change the rules in order to maintain its membership.  We want Britain to remain part of the European Union; it is in our best interests and that of the European Union.  It is rather regrettable that Northern public representatives, in a very old-style way, seek to suggest that we be excluded from any discussions on the issue.  I hope there will be some reflection on that from those protagonists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600024#W00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453827300,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin.

Having delivered on all of the commitments and exceeded targets over the three years of the programme, it was and remains a key priority of the Government to ease the bank burden on Irish taxpayers and clean up our banks as we make our way to economic recovery.  In that sense, banks have been recapitalised and restructured.  IBRC was liquidated and the promissory notes replaced with long-term bonds in order to dramatically reduce our market funding requirements.  Interest rate reductions on our loans were achieved, not just here but in other places.  Agreement was reached with our eurozone partners for the repayment of our EFSM and ESF loans to be extended by seven years.  Those steps have had the effect of stabilising our financial system and reversing the outflows of deposits and other funds that have crippled this economy for quite a number of years. <\/p>  <p>  As regards recapitalisation, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, a direct recapitalisation instrument, was agreed in principle in 2012.  There is a limit of &euro;60 billion on the total amount of ESM resources available for direct recapitalisation of institutions.  Should the ESM use its direct recapitalisation instrument, it would, as a rule, acquire common shares in the beneficiary institution.<\/p><p>Circumstances have improved dramatically since then, and the ESM is not the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.

Clearly, the European Union and Turkey must work together. The joint action plan agreed on 29 November is designed to assist Turkey in providing for refugees in its own territory and to prevent uncontrolled migration from there to the European Union.  We are committed to working with Turkey on the &euro;3 billion fund for supporting refugees from Syria based there.  Implementation of this will be critical.  Insufficient progress has been made and there is no question about this.  When we spoke to other countries, Jordan and Lebanon stated they also need support.  They raised a valid point on the camps.  Some of them are enormous, as the Deputy is aware, and children's education, maternity facilities, hygiene facilities, food and nutrition are enormously complicated.  We have no sense of the scale of what is happening in those camps.<\/p>  <p>  There have been some positive moves since 29 November.  The Deputy mentioned pre-accession.  Chapter 17 of the accession negotiations is about economic and monetary policy, and this has been opened with Turkey.  The participation of the Turkish Foreign Minister in a good discussion with EU Foreign Ministers at the December Foreign Affairs Council was the start of this.  Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President of the Commission, recently met the Turkish Ministers of Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Justice to emphasise the need to speed up implementation of the joint action plan.  Vice-President Mogherini and Commissioner Hahn also met the Turkish side, where the same need for implementation was underlined.  Further close monitoring of this will be critical.  As the Deputy understands, these are complicated discussions.<\/p>  <p>  The internal situation in Turkey is of a serious nature.  The conflict between the Turkish Government and the Kurdistan Workers' Party restarted in July 2015, with 180 civilians killed in violence since then.  There are clearly human rights concerns.  Ireland strongly condemns the horrific suicide terrorist attacks which took place, the twin suicide bombings in Ankara on 10 October, which killed 102 people, and in Istanbul on 12 January, which killed ten people, including eight German tourists.  The latest Commission progress report on the EU accession process noted a number of concerns, including with regard to significant shortcomings affecting the independence of the judiciary, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and we continue to raise these concerns, including most recently at the Council meeting in December.  We and our European partners will continue this dialogue with Turkey.<\/p>  <p>  We did not have a detailed briefing on the incidents of sexual assault and abuse in Cologne, but they were of a very serious nature.  I discussed this with the Minister-President of Bavaria, Mr. Seehofer, when I had occasion to meet him in recent weeks.  This is regarded as a very serious issue in Germany, and the police authorities there are on a very clear alert.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the issues raised about the UK Prime Minister and the case being put for the referendum, as I said to Deputy O'Brien, the paper in response has not yet been circulated by President Tusk.  It is due early next week.  We will see the detail of how he intends to respond and what input the European Commission might have.  At the December meeting, President Juncker stated the Commission had views on a number of the elements attached to the four issues and he would like to make an input.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental question is not about the restructuring of freedom of movement, although there are concerns about the Schengen Agreement and whether countries are in a position to police their borders, and the issue of the Dublin Convention is being reviewed in regard to where people might be sent back if they are to be sent back for whatever reason.  This is an issue that is of some concern at present to countries.  In regard to the issue of welfare, in Britain there appears to be a very strong view among people that for persons to draw benefit or benefit in work, they should make a contribution before they draw to make that a workable situation.  This is a central issue that comes up very often in Britain, and it is an issue that is of concern to the Prime Minister.  He has said on a number of occasions that he would like to see a number of options he has tabled being considered and that an outcome could be agreed on this.  I do not know the detail of this yet because I assume President Tusk will respond to this in his paper.<\/p>  <p>  There will be very strong objections to any restriction on the free movement of people, and the opportunity to move from place to place comes with the Internal Market.  In our case in Ireland, the common travel area between here and Britain and Northern Ireland allows for ease of doing business, commerce, trade and other activities.  I believe the issue regarding the eurozone and other countries in the European Union which are not members of the eurozone is one that can be resolved.  There are two currencies.  In Britain there is sterling, we have the euro and there are various currencies in other countries outside the eurozone.  This is an issue that can be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's final comments, we have been very forthright about being as open and generous as Fianna F&aacute;il was to the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  We have had joint trade missions to Singapore.  We had personnel from Northern Ireland in Brussels during our Presidency in order that they would be fully informed on the advantages of what might be going through regarding the Common Agricultural Policy or Cohesion Fund money.  In this regard, the practical arrangements on which we have worked so hard to get cross-Border activities in a range of sectors are ones on which we can build for the future.  The referendum is a matter for the electorate in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, but we are all members of the European Union.  Yesterday, when I spoke to more than 120 or 130 people in McCann FitzGerald in London, I made it perfectly clear that we have a real interest in this because the decision is so critical.  McCann FitzGerald is one of the big Irish law firms and has been established in London for 30 years.  These people are Irish citizens who will vote in the referendum.  They understand the parallel, in that when we had to vote on the fiscal stability treaty people voted 60:40 in favour of the euro, the eurozone and the European Union.<\/p><p>Essentially, it is a matter for those who go to vote in the United Kingdom to make their choice.  We want to see Britain remain a central and strong member of the Union in the time ahead.  It is of interest to Britain, it is of interest to Europe and it is certainly of interest to Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600025#X01800","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453828500,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Much as the Government wishes to trumpet its success, stability and the so-called turnaround of the economy, the issue of the odious debt heaped on the back of this country and its citizens, the terrible cost that has imposed on our economy and people and the threat it represents to the economy continues to return.  Has the Taoiseach read the most recent report from the European Commission, which points to the risks of our very high debt levels which it says are high in the medium term and are very sensitive to any significant shocks in economic growth?  Such shocks are, of course, being widely predicted.  Has the Taoiseach read the European Commission's report?  It is extremely concerned about our debt and our vulnerability to economic shocks.  I just came from the finance committee, where Philip Lane, the Governor of the Central Bank, made precisely the same point as the European Commission is making.  He said, when asked about the growth projections of this Government and the so-called \"fiscal space\", that we need to have a \"we may be wrong\" scenario.  Those were his words.  He talked in particular about the problem of our high level of debt and the risk that poses to us if we are wrong.  Given the gathering clouds of possible international recession, are we not pursuing a very dangerous strategy, given our high levels of debt?<\/p>  <p>  That brings me to the last, linked question.  This morning, the European Court of Auditors produced a report on the European Commission's handling of the Irish bailout.  It is a very damning report because it says the European Commission got it badly wrong.  It was charged with monitoring and giving warnings if there were problems in terms of people's budgets.  The report quotes, for example, the very misguided and utterly wrong judgment of the European Commission in March 2008, when it said of the Irish economy, \"the risks attached to the budgetary projections are broadly neutral for 2008\".  My God, did they get that wrong.  The report from the auditors goes on to say the European Commission estimated the country's budgets to be much stronger than they turned out to be, and so on.  They all said the European Commission was extremely bad at keeping records.  They said there was no proper record-keeping of the post-crash programme teams, that there was no proper oversight of those programme teams and that alternative scenarios were not properly looked at in terms of burden-sharing on debt.<\/p>  <p>  This is the point and the question.  What the auditors are now confirming is something that some of us have been saying since the very beginning, namely, that the EU itself was very significantly responsible for the failures that led to the crash and that it should have shared the burden.  The Taoiseach promised before the last election that he would make it share the burden.  He promised that we would burn the bondholders and that there would be burden-sharing.  Now we have the European Court of Auditors saying Europe was asleep at the wheel months before the crash was about to hit and engulf the economy.

He said he did not.  In his reply, he is now saying that the investment in AIB and Bank of Ireland and so on, which the previous Government made, was effective.  It was always understood that the retrospective debt forgiveness was outside of those; it was in respect of losses in other banks.  In 2012, when the game changer meeting was announced with Mario Monti and the then Commissioner and so on, it was understood that the option of selling AIB and Bank of Ireland was always there.  The non-recoupable debt that was entered into was always the key point.  The Taoiseach promised to burn the bondholders.  The former T&aacute;naiste did it in more graphic terms when he said it was \"Frankfurt's way or Labour's way\".  We know Jean-Claude Trichet said a bomb would go off and that it would be in Dublin that it would go off.  He said that to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  The Minister confirmed that to the banking inquiry.  The European Union's position that banks must not be allowed to fail, after Lehmann's, and that the bondholders must not be burned was, therefore, very clear.  That was made clear to the previous Government and to this Government.<\/p>  <p>  On the debt issue, there was a decision in 2012 by the European Council.  We were led by the Taoiseach and the former T&aacute;naiste that this was a game changer of a decision, which would lead to a retrospective debt deal.  The Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, had a press conference about it and said we could expect about &euro;6 billion.  We cannot dress it up or camouflage all of that by identifying AIB as the new route.  That was always there as a route.  Bank of Ireland was always there as a route, before any mention of a game changer.  Is it now the Government's position that it is no longer seeking a retrospective debt deal?  I just want a simple yes or no response to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600026#Y02800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453828500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600026#Y02900","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453828500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Given the lack of time, I will let the Taoiseach respond to the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600026#Y03000","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1453828500,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the European Court of Auditors report and the Commission's response.<\/p><p>This is 120 pages long and obviously it will require some reading.

At the same time, the Court of Auditors noted specifically the unprecedented nature and extent of the financial crisis.  In that context, it stated that the assistance programmes were mostly soundly based and that the Commission's capacities for dealing with the programmes improved over time.  We were first out of that gap, as Deputy Martin will be well aware.  It is fine and true to say that was always there in terms of the banks, but when the banks were deemed to be worthless one had no other option but to ask, \"How will we be able to recoup what the Irish taxpayer put into this?\"  That is why &euro;60 billion was put aside as an option under that facility.

It would require unanimity from around the table.  The reflection of other countries on the progress made by Ireland, being the fastest growing economy for the past two years with our deficit to be wiped out by 2017-2018 and our debt falling towards European norms, puts us in a very different position from where we were only a few years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the fiscal space.  That is the sum of money that is available up to 2021.  It is the amount of money the Department of Finance estimates will be available for expenditure increases and tax reductions in each budget.  That is based, as Deputy Boyd Barrett will be aware, on an assessment of Ireland's compliance with the benchmarks that have been set for expenditure.  It is a very important figure because, in the absence of measures to offset this, expenditure and tax commitments must be accommodated within the available fiscal space.<\/p>  <p>  At budget time, the Department of Finance estimated that there would be gross fiscal space over the next five budgets of &euro;10.9 billion.  In addition, the Department set out that if a decision is taken not to index the tax system, as was the case in 2016, an additional &euro;2 billion in fiscal space would be available.  That means that if one introduces a tax and raises money from it, one is entitled to spend that money.

In addition, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimates that an average of &euro;400 million of that fiscal space in each year - &euro;2 billion over the next five budgets - is required to meet demographic and other costs that will arise.  Taking those factors into account, the net fiscal space that was estimated at budget time was &euro;8.6 billion.  In line with the fiscal rules, the European Commission updates each member state's minimum medium-term objectives every three years and the updated medium-term objective to cover the period 2017-2019 is expected in the next week or two.  Given the decline in the Irish debt ratio and other factors, it is likely that the minimum medium-term objective proposed by the Commission for Ireland might be slightly less stringent than was previously the case.  The Department of Finance has estimated that a structural deficit of -0.5% of GDP rather than the current 0% of GDP is more likely but we will have to await the outcome of all those technical discussions as to what that actually will be.  While there are many moving parts to it, a decision to adopt a less stringent medium-term objective would add an estimated &euro;1.5 billion to the indicative fiscal space in total over the period 2017 to 2021 and that would increase the gross fiscal space from &euro;10.9 billion to approximately &euro;12.5 billion and the net fiscal space from &euro;8.6 billion to &euro;10 billion, all other things being equal.  The Minister for Finance will spell out further details of that when he is given the updated review by the European Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600027#Z00700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1453829100,"counter":292,"content":"<p>That is getting ready for the manifesto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600027#Z00800","speaker":"992"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453829100,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1453829100,"counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600027#Z00950"},{"type":"speech","time":1453829100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 13, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 (section 44) (Variation of Indemnity Amount) Order 2016; No. 13a, Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 [Seanad] &ndash; Motion to Instruct the Committee; No. 13b, Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 [Seanad] - Financial Resolution; and No. 33, Technological Universities Bill 2015 - Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.

I want to know whether a special case has been made in that regard and about the timeframe involved.  Thankfully, those involved with the airport are developing new transatlantic flights and trying to open that market.  For that reason, they need capital investment immediately.  The apron and the runway need to be extended to cater for the traffic at the airport.  All of this needs to be done to put the airport on a self-financing footing.  The airport is of strategic importance because it serves the west and north west regions and caters for approximately 700,000 passengers each year.  In recent years, the authorities at the airport have been explaining the case for the expansion of the airport so that it can grow further.  Passenger numbers have been maintained at 700,000.  The airport would need to have more than1 million passengers in order to become self-financing.  It wants to grow.  It is always on the lookout for more business.  It is very dynamic and efficient.<\/p>  <p>  The west is the only region in the country that is not serviced by motorways, high-speed trains, or developed cargo and passenger deep-water ports.  It is a peripheral region in Ireland and in Europe.  Ireland West Airport Knock is not like any other regional airport.  Most of the other regional airports, with the exception of Donegal Airport, are located in the shadows of the State airports - Cork Airport, Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport.  Above all, with pride we know and declare that Ireland West Airport Knock is the people's airport and, in this regard, is a different creature from any of the other airports in the State.  It is very dear to the people of the west of Ireland, who have personally invested a lot in it.  The airport is run by a not-for-profit trust which was asked some time ago to take responsibility for running the airport while stimulating enterprise and jobs.  It has a very broad remit.  Its broad objective is to bring economic activity and growth into the region.  To tell the truth, the region would be lost without the airport.<\/p><p>It is key to our future development.  More than two and half years ago, a joint study group involving Ireland West Airport Knock and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport completed its in-depth review of the strategic options for the airport.  In terms of capital investment, a commitment was given to Knock that 90% funding would be made available for it to carry out these crucial works.  It does not want to look for money from the State forever; it wants to be self-financing after 2024.  On that occasion last summer, we were told that the regional airports programme had been approved by the European Commission.  That is very welcome, but it will only give Knock 75% funding when it needs 90% funding.  We were told at that juncture that a further business case would have to be made for Knock.  As I have outlined before, this investment is critical to the growth and development of the airport and its future sustainability.  I would like to know what progress has been made, because time is of the essence.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the &euro;600,000 OPEX funding that was announced before Christmas.  This will help Knock balance its books for last year and cover operational losses for the year; its operational losses will remain until it can become self-financing.  I will briefly restate that Ireland West Airport Knock should not have to compete with other regional airports for funding from the same pot.  Knock is in an entirely different league and needs to be recognised.  I also suggest that in our national aviation policy, Knock should be given recognition for its strategic importance and should not be treated the same as other regional airports, because it is most definitely not the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600029#BB10700","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453830900,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who apologises for being unable to attend this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  The Exchequer provides funding supports to the four regional airports in Donegal, Kerry, Waterford and Knock under the regional airports programme operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Over the past decade, Knock has received almost &euro;21 million in Exchequer support in operational and capital grants under the OPEX and CAPEX funding schemes administered by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  In August last year, the European Commission gave its approval for the Department's new regional airports programme, which takes account of the recommendations of the Knock study group and the subsequent decision by Government to continue funding supports to the four regional airports.  That decision recognised that the regional airports should be given the opportunity beyond 2014 to grow to a viable, self-sustaining position, particularly considering the contribution that they make to their respective regional and local economies.  This was also acknowledged in the new national aviation policy that was published last August.  The Deputy will be aware that, under new EU state aid guidelines of 2014, the maximum level of aid permissible for capital projects at airports with fewer than 1 million passengers per annum is 75%.  The EU guidelines recognise, however, that airports in this category may face difficulties in sourcing the balance of at least 25%.  Subject to a case-by-case assessment, an aid rate in excess of 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances.  In such a scenario, the Commission has indicated that a business case justifying any proposed higher aid rate would have to be approved by it and must be able to demonstrate the airport's inability to proceed with the proposed investment at the 75% aid rate.  Under a new aspect of the regional airports programme called the public policy remit, all of the regional airports, including Knock, are eligible for grant assistance up to 90% towards the cost of capital investments in the areas of safety and security.  There is also a PPR scheme which assists with grants of up to 100% of the operational costs of the airports in these two areas.  Last year, under the first year of the new programme, Knock received almost &euro;1.2 million in grant supports from the Department and the latter has already begun engaging again with all four airports on their future requirements for capital grant assistance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is, of course, aware that Knock has indicated that it will require a higher grant rate than the maximum 75% permitted under the EU guidelines for certain major capital projects that are planned at the airport over the coming years.

I cannot believe the Department has not made an application for 90% funding for Knock airport at this stage.  A commitment was made two and a half years ago under the Ireland West Airport Knock-Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport study group, chaired by Deputy John O'Mahony, to give 90% funding.  Last August, I was somewhat disappointed when we were told that the funding was actually 75% on approval of the regional airports programme by the European Commission with the opportunity to make a special case to seek 90%.  I am now told that the conversation is ongoing.  There is an idea that the ongoing engagement with Knock continues to address this issue, but it is not being addressed.  This is two and a half years down the line.  Last summer we were told that a 90% application was required, and the board at Knock airport is ready, willing and able to do whatever is required, including bending over backwards, to get such an application before the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  What is going on in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  I can never seem to get any answers.  I have submitted parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests to find out what communication there has been between the Department and the Commission on Knock.  It seems there has been very little.  I am sad to say that the Minister of State has given another standard-issue answer.  Knock is being treated like every other regional airport, but it is not the same.  I mean no disrespect to every other regional airport in the country.  Ours is the only region that does not have another State airport.  It seems to me that this has been going against Knock in terms of its treatment by the Department and has been happening since its inception or conception, whatever one wants to call it.  Will the report and agreement signed up to by the Department be honoured?  The Department signed up to the 90% at the time.

I am raising this for them because of their extreme frustration.  The residents there want a 3.5 tonne weight restriction limit imposed on the above cell group of roads for the following reasons.  First, all the roads concerned are residential roads not suited to large heavy vehicles.  Some are on a hill, especially Kennelsfort Road, which adds to the noise made by large vehicles.  Second, a significant number of trucks come off the R148, which becomes the N4 west of the M50, on to Kennelsfort Road in particular.  However, the other roads need to be included in the restriction area, because if it only applied to Kennelsfort Road, truck drivers might use the other roads as an alternative and come in off the area called \"The Oval.\"  Third, a 3.5 tonne restriction limit would be in line with the 3.5 tonne restriction limit on Ballyfermot Road, Dublin 10, which is, in reality, a continuation of Kennelsfort Road.  The only difference is that Ballyfermot Road is in the Dublin City Council area, as opposed to Kennelsfort Road which is under the domain of South Dublin County Council.  Fourth, currently Kennelsfort Road has a 7.5 tonne restriction limit which is widely ignored.  A 3.5 tonne restriction limit would respect the residential nature of the area.  There is one industrial estate up this road but this can be accessed by non-residential roads, such as off the N4 at Liffey Valley shopping centre, along the Fonthill and Coldcut Roads.  There are also industrial estates and a prison between Palmerstown and Clondalkin, which are often accessed from Kennelsfort Road.  These can also be accessed from the same Liffey Valley N4 exit.<\/p> <p> I am raising this because of the extreme frustration of residents at the failure to make progress.  For example, in July 2015, South Dublin County Council overwhelmingly adopted a motion in favour of a 3.5 tonne restriction limit at this point.  In spite of that, officialdom stands in the way.  Officials in South Dublin County Council show no inclination to be of assistance.  In addition, Mr. Kieran Kenny, assistant Garda Commissioner, in a letter to one of the residents on 6 January 2016, stated that the 7.5 tonne restriction limit should remain.  Even back as far as 1995, a motion calling for a 3.5 tonne restriction limit was passed by South Dublin County Council.  Since that time there have been EU directives on noise and trucks.  Can the Minister ensure that those directives are not being broken on Kennelsfort Road and the surrounding cell roads in Palmerstown?<\/p> <p> Also, it would seem from a parliamentary question I asked that there are no, or almost no, convictions of truck drivers who break the current 7.5 tonne restriction ban.  The roads in question were built in the 1950s and 1960s, before the time when traffic calming was considered necessary.  What Palmerstown residents have to put up with would not be inflicted on residents in more modern estates.  Can the Minister of State please ask the senior Minister to deal with these issues?  Otherwise, the residents will be left in continuous frustration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600030#CC01000","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453831500,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  I understand that Deputy Dowds has been very proactive on this issue for quite some time and I thank him for raising the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the background to this issue arises from the concerns of local residents living in the immediate area in relation to the use of surrounding residential roads by heavy goods vehicles and their wish to see a 3.5 tonne vehicle weight restriction applied to Kennelsfort Road for traffic management purposes.  While I cannot comment on the specifics of any weight restriction currently applying to the Kennelsfort Road, decisions in respect of the application of such weight restrictions are entirely a matter for the relevant local authority.  In this instance, and based on the intervention of Deputy Dowds, that would appear to be South Dublin County Council, though my script states it is Dublin City Council.  The Minister does not have any role to play in such decisions.<\/p>  <p>  However, should South Dublin County Council decide to apply such a weight restriction on Kennelsfort Road, this would be indicated by the use of the appropriate vehicle weight limit sign.  The legislative basis underpinning the erection of such regulatory signage is provided for under road traffic legislation with which all local authorities must comply.  Also, further details relating to regulatory vehicle weights signage are set out for local authorities in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's 2010 traffic signs manual.<\/p>  <p>  The Road Traffic (Signs) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, SI 331 of 2012, and the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2012, SI 332 of 2012, provide the legislative basis for weight restrictions on vehicles entering a road and associated signage.  Relevant signage in this regard includes regulatory upright sign RUS 015, which is used in traffic management and road safety issues such as prohibiting heavy vehicles from using residential roads, and RUS 053, which is used in cases of entry restrictions relating to the structural integrity of the road network, including bridges.  Sign RUS 015, giving maximum design gross vehicle weight, is used at the entrance of a road and provides that drivers of vehicles whose design gross vehicle weight exceeds the weight specified on the sign are prohibited from proceeding beyond that point except where it is necessary for a vehicle to gain access to, or egress from, premises accessible only from that road.  RUS 053 indicates that the driver of a vehicle exceeding the design gross vehicle weight displayed on the sign shall not proceed beyond it.  There are no exceptions to this regulation.  The entry restrictions associated with traffic signs RUS 015 and RUS 053 apply to all vehicles, including buses, which exceed the design gross vehicle weight specified on either sign.  Any decision by a local authority to apply such restrictions would have to take account of whether the road in question is used as part of a bus route.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, individual local authorities are best placed to assess the particular local vehicle weight requirements, based on either road safety or traffic management grounds, which should apply to a particular individual road.  However, as previously mentioned, if such weight limit controls are applied, local authorities must erect signage that is in full compliance with regulations.  The enforcement of road traffic regulations governing vehicle weight limits on any particular public road is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600031#DD00200","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1453831500,"counter":455,"content":"<p>As expected, I am very frustrated by the reply.

However, I assure the Deputy that I will raise this directly with the Minister, who is currently in the Seanad dealing with the Road Traffic Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the great work of Deputy Dowds and the fastidious and meticulous way in which he has always dealt with issues relating to his constituents.  We all hope we will be back in the House.  Deputy Dowds has made an outstanding contribution to this House and to the Parliamentary Labour Party.

I was honoured to serve with him on the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  He was a fine member of that committee, to which he brought to bear his experience in the education sector.  Indeed, he also brought his experience in life and in the community to bear in terms of his role in, and contribution to, the D&aacute;il.  He will be a loss to the Parliament.  We come from different perspectives politically and challenged each other at times, but he has been an exceptional parliamentarian and I wish well with whatever he does next.  Likewise, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish you well after a very distinguished career in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, will be hoping to have more opportunities to address the House in the future.  However, none of us knows whether that will be the case, and we will be battling hard over the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this Topical Issue and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, for coming to the House to respond to it.  I will address the issue of farm assist from two perspectives.  The first relates to the impact the Government has had through implementing several cuts to farm assist payments over the past three or four years, most notably through the removal of the income disregard.  When this Government took office, 70% of what a farmer earns was calculated for the purposes of assessing means for a farm assist payment.  Over two years the Government removed that income disregard.  Now, every euro a farm family earns is deducted directly from their farm assist payment, thus removing any incentive for production and to work hard.  Despite the approach taken by the Government, farm families across the country continue to work hard, because that is their ethic and tradition.  They are proud to be hard-working farm families.  I represent a part of the country that has a higher number of people on farm assist than probably any other part of the country.  There are 1,500 farm families in County Donegal availing of farm assist out of 10,000 nationally.  I have seen grown men and women sit across a table from me in very distressed states.  They are proud people who have worked hard all their lives but have seen their farm assist payment cut as a result of the changes the Government has introduced, thus putting their families in a situation of penury in which they are wondering how they can continue to operate their family farms.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside this, over recent weeks the approach of the Government has led many farm families to believe that the Government does not want them to continue to operate as farm families and to be assisted in doing that.  That approach can be seen in the review forms that have been issued over the last couple of weeks to many farm families in Donegal.  Every year review forms have been issued to farm families which basically ask them if there has been a change in their circumstances and, if so, advising them to notify the Department.  On this occasion the families have received comprehensive forms asking them to outline all income for the last year.  It is a periodic review that is akin to a total review.  I worked hard with a number of families to appeal reductions in their farm assist payments in recent months.  Having succeeded with those appeals, over the last period of time they have once again received another review form.  In this review form they are asked to indicate all income for the previous year, but they are not asked for their expenditure.  At the bottom of each page it is stated in big, bold print that the penalty for a false statement is a fine or imprisonment or both.  In addition, it is stated at the top of the form that the form must be returned with all documentation within 14 days as otherwise the payment will cease.  These farm families feel they are being harassed by the Government and that the Government does not want them to continue availing of the farm assist payment.  Will the Minister ensure that all of the farm families who have received these forms will be allowed appropriate time to return the documentation that is sought from them, as much of it will take time to collect?  Second, will the Minister acknowledge that these farm families must be supported and reverse the very damaging cuts that have been implemented by the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600032#EE00600","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1453832100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I do not wish to be too early in wishing you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the very best, as I believe the election is not to be held until the spring.  I am still working out what the interpretation of the Irish spring is, but the daffodils are up in my garden so perhaps the spring is very close.  However, I do not wish to make light of the issue the Deputy raises as it is very important.<\/p>  <p>  This Government supports farming families.  The farm assist scheme provides support for farmers on low incomes and is similar to the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme, with approximately 8,800 individuals receiving a weekly payment under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Changes introduced in the budgets of 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed persons.  However, it should be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the agri-environment options scheme or special area of conservation schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income, the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded, with the balance being assessed as means.  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming.<\/p><p>Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.   I outline in the formal written reply items with regard to the recent flooding, humanitarian grounds and the emergency fodder scheme.<\/p> <p> The farm assist scheme must be kept under ongoing review by my officials from a policy and administration point of view.  It is important to note that the farm assist scheme remains a flexible payment and that any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cashflow issues, due, for example, to the recent bad weather, may ask his or her local Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his or her claim.  The Deputy mentioned in particular the forms for review of the payment and the provision of an appropriate period to allow people to fill in the forms.  As the Deputy has raised it with me, I will look at the forms and see if it is necessary to extend the time for review.  I will talk to my officials tomorrow about that to see exactly where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600032#EE00700","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453832700,"counter":465,"content":"<p>It is exceptionally important that the Minister of State talk to the T&aacute;naiste about the deadline being imposed on farmers for the return of the forms.  For example, they are being asked for the first time for a total list of all livestock sold and bought over the last year, bank statements for the last 12 months and also final subsidy tallies from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which do not come out until February.  Naturally, many farmers have been left feeling they have been asked to do something with which it will be extremely difficult to comply.  That is on top of the fact that they feel they are constantly getting a message from the Government that it would prefer if they were not availing of the farm assist scheme, which it would like to remove entirely.<\/p>  <p>  As I pointed out, the removal of the income disregard with the change from 70% to 100% has meant that many farm families struggle now to make a living of any description on the family farm.  They have to work day in and day out.  In some cases, they have to work 50 or 60 hours per week in order to make an income, only to have every euro they make deducted from their social welfare payments, payments that would bring them up to what they would get on unemployment assistance if they were not making any income on the farm at all.  It is a scandalous cut that the Government has introduced and its impact is that 41% of farm families have experienced a reduction in their farm assist payments.  The cut must be reversed.  I ask the Minister of State to go back and discuss it with his Department.  It is certainly a commitment my party is making.  It is something on which the Department must carry out an impact assessment.  Simply put, the Government and, in particular, the T&aacute;naiste do not realise the impact of this cut on so many families.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue and I urge the Minister of State to ensure that all families who have received application forms are written to and given appropriate time to allow them to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600033#FF00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1453832700,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Last week, however, they were shocked to receive letters from Revenue reversing this decision.  Can the Minister for Finance explain why?  At the core of the issue are families and individuals who have done nothing wrong but find themselves living in homes that are dangerous.  The fact is that the homes are valueless at this point in time.  The Revenue Commissioners appeared to have seen sense and adopted a sensible, humane approach by reducing the LPT to the lowest level.  Frankly, it was obscene that these families were asked to pay anything, but the Revenue Commissioners at least showed some willingness to use common sense and the flexibility permitted to them to reduce the band.  However, the bureaucratic wheels turned and a second letter was sent only this week to the residents.<\/p><p>The language in that letter is shocking.  According to it, the letter of 20 November \"incorrectly indicated that the declared valuation for your property could be reduced and I wish to apologise for any inconvenience caused\".  This bureaucratic reply does not address the issue at hand.  It is unfair to ask these families or those in similarly affected complexes, such as Riverwalk Court, to pay the local property tax, LPT.  To tell them that their bills would be reduced was a welcome step, but that has been taken away by the Revenue letter.  This incompetence is stunning.<\/p> <p> Leaving all of that aside, we must address the core issue, that is, why people who have been through so much are still being asked to pay a tax that is clearly not set at the value of their homes.  There are probably only a few days left in which to fix this problem if the Minister insists that it is a legal issue.  Will he confirm that, due to the cynical postponement of the next valuation date for LPT, the residents are stuck in their current band for a further three years?  Can the Longboat Quay complex or other addresses be added to the list of estates that are exempt from LPT?<\/p> <p> After much campaigning last year on the residents' plight, we have come to this.  That they are being asked to pay the full LPT is mad.  There should be exemptions in such cases.  Previously, there were exemptions.  At first, the residents were given the indication that exceptions would be made, but it now appears that this leeway has been reversed.  Will the Minister explain the reasons?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600033#FF00500","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453833300,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this issue.  The introduction of the LPT formed part of a broader approach to the taxation of property that aims to replace some of the revenues from transaction-based taxes, which proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience had shown to be a stable source of funding.  Stability needs to be at the core of our public finances now and in the years ahead.  LPT enables us to achieve the goal of stability in a way that does not directly impact on employment.  From the start of its term, the Government has been unwavering in its determination to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  Job creation has been the Government's top priority.  The LPT, which is a tax on assets rather than employment, will not adversely affect job creation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the LPT should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity and that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exceptions.  Limiting the exceptions available allows the rate to be kept to a minimum for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  Deputies will appreciate that reliefs and exemptions have costs that must be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy that needs to be addressed.  Even with the limited number of exemptions available under the legislation, I understand that exemptions were claimed in respect of some 42,000 properties for the 2014 LPT.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that any property that is in use as, or that is suitable for use as, a dwelling house is subject to LPT.<\/p>  <p>  The current valuation period is 1 May 2013 until 31 October 2019.  The period was recently extended from 31 October 2016 on foot of legislative amendment via the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015.  This amendment was introduced to give property owners certainty in regard to valuations and to remove concerns that LPT liabilities could rise significantly, particularly in urban areas, as the property market recovered.<\/p>  <p>  The 1 May 2013 declared valuation of any residential property is not affected by subsequent repairs or improvements made to a property or by any increase or decrease in property prices that might occur over the course of the valuation period.  The LPT due for any residential property is based on the market value at 1 May 2013.  Where structural defects are detected two years later, as happened in the Longboat Quay complex, they may affect the current valuation of the properties.  However, they do not change the valuation retrospectively.  Therefore, there is no basis in law to reduce the valuation during the LPT valuation period.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, due to the error to which the Deputy referred, a small number of property owners in the Longboat Quay complex received letters from Revenue indicating that a reduction in valuation was possible.  On discovering the error, Revenue immediately wrote to the persons involved apologising for the incorrect information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600034#GG00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1453833300,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I accept that the LPT was set in May 2013, but that valuation was high and many of the residents in Longboat Quay did not fully understand the problems or know what was about to happen.  A large number of them are in a serious situation, have needed to spend money and are going through the inconvenience caused by what has happened at the estate, but the Minister is sticking by the mantra that the LPT is virtually set in stone.  Previously, however, there were exemptions.  At one stage, for example, houses that were in NAMA or had not been properly taken in charge were exempted.  There is a precedent.  It would be a small gesture if we were to make exemptions in cases like this one.  Simply being told that a letter was issued in error has been a blow to the residents, who believed that there was some hope of relief.  Turning around now is very unfair to them.<\/p>  <p>  Come 2019, when the property tax is valued at a new rate, there will be a major change for everyone, not just those in Longboat Quay, because of rising values in the city.  This issue will have to be addressed.  Previously, the Minister stated that he would consider it when it arose, but that assumed he would be in power.  This issue will affect many people because their valuations will be at higher rates than is the case currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600034#GG00300","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1453833300,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy further information.

On discovering the error, Revenue immediately wrote to the original persons involved apologising for the incorrect information.  Revenue also wrote to the other property owners who were seeking similar reductions to confirm that the valuations could not be reduced.

I know she will argue in her rebuttal that this would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill, but I ask her to hear me out.  As she is aware, we are in favour of the introduction of technological universities, but not in the way she is proposing and the way the Department has brought forward this legislation.  As she said in her opening contribution, this is very complex legislation.  Despite her claim that there has been ongoing engagement with the trade unions and staff on this, I do not believe, having spoken to members of the TUI, that this is the case.  The TUI has informed me that it has had three meetings in the past year with the Department and that it was very clear at those meetings that they were briefings rather than engagements.  In the TUI's opinion, none of the significant concerns raised has been taken on board.<\/p><p>In the absence of an allocation of proper funding for the merger process, it is difficult to regard this Bill as anything other than the bandying about of the word &quot;university.&quot;  Many staff members feel it is just a smoke screen for rationalisation, which would have severe detrimental effects not only on staff but also on students in terms of both access to third level education and the quality of service therein.  That there is no guarantee that the technological university designation will be conferred on a merged institute of technology entity, and that the provisions of the Bill apply to both merged and non-merged institutes of technology and technological universities, are of concern.<\/p><p>We still have concerns over the potential consequences of the Bill, given the current crisis owing to under-funding, under-staffing and precarious employment in the institutions, which we believe has still not been addressed.  Between 2008 and 2015, funding for the sector was cut by a massive 35%, or nearly &euro;190 million.  Over the same period, lecturer numbers fell by almost 10%, or by 535, while student numbers rose by a staggering 32%, or in excess of 21,000.  There is no guarantee that the mergers, if they were to proceed, would not result in a reduced number of courses.<\/p><p>As a result of the massive cuts in funding, the resulting loss of lecturers and the staggering increase in the number of students, many institutes are just keeping their heads above water.  The intention to effect such considerable additional change without appropriate resourcing in an era of significantly damaging cutbacks to the sector is, at best, ill-advised.  We believe the requirement that institutes of technology must merge before they can apply for technological university status is more related to a programme of rationalisation than to any academic considerations based on the various missions, values and ethos of particular institutes.<\/p><p>Those mergers that are envisaged must be appropriately funded, and the regional mission, including multiple programmes, which is central to the institute of technology ethos, must be retained.  Institutes have a proven track record of excellence in programme development and content, in addition to a significant commitment to regional equality and equity of access.  They provide multiple programmes from National Framework of Qualifications level 6 to level 10, ranging from apprenticeships to doctorates.  The mission of the sector is distinct, with a strong focus on meeting local and regional needs.<\/p><p>A rationalisation agenda will lead to a dramatic reduction in the provision of some of the programmes, in my opinion and that of many of the academics.  There are serious justified concerns about a risk of geographical inequity in respect of access to higher education as a result of this Bill.  Towns and communities with an existing institute that is being coerced or forced to merge under the requirements of the Bill have real cause to worry.  As matters stand, an invaluable part of a local economy may effectively be downgraded or asset-stripped as a result of this Bill.  Throughout the whole process, there has been in some institutes a consistent failure to properly consult the real experts, the academic staff.<\/p><p>The Bill, despite the changes and additions the Minister has proposed regarding the social and cultural objectives, is still excessively focused on the concerns of business and enterprise.  It would be a grave mistake to prioritise the short-term needs of employers over the long-term needs of students and society.  An appropriate balance is required.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the threat the Bill poses to national collective bargaining and the terms and conditions of staff members.  Other concerns related to the Bill include the weakening of staff and local representation on governing bodies and the weakening of the academic voice.

The discussion of the Bill in the Select Sub-Committee on Education and Skills was very useful and the engagement on the part of the Department was good.  There is no rationale for the decision to rush the Bill in recent weeks.  The Minister did not engage in any real consultation in advance of Committee Stage and Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Academics and staff in various institutes of technology are concerned about the contents of the Bill and the impact some of the proposals will have, specifically the requirement that mergers must take place in advance of approval being given for technological university status.  This issue must be revisited.  Mergers should not be a prerequisite for technological university status being granted, especially as there is no guaranteed outcome for institutions that proceed with a merger.  Naturally, the institutes of technology have genuine and well-founded concerns about what the merger process may mean for their individual identities and ability to continue to serve their local regions, as they have done so well until now.  <\/p>  <p>  Since their development, the regional technical colleges and, subsequently, the institutes of technology have played a major role in their regions in seeking to ensure participation in education as well as integration with the local business community.  They have done so by serving the needs of the local economy and the educational needs of the communities they serve.  There are genuine concerns that this function will be eroded by the merger process required of institutes of technology seeking to advance to technological university status and that mergers will create a gravitational pull towards the centre. <\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, the Minister must further consult trade unions and institutes of technology staff on her proposal.

With regard to the issue of time, the Second Stage debate was not guillotined and we had a long and good debate on Committee Stage.  We also left sufficient time between Committee Stage and Report Stage to allow a significant number of amendments to be submitted by Opposition Deputies and a smaller number to be submitted by me in response to the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  The Report Stage debate will not be guillotined either.  As the schedule for the week indicates, we will have time to discuss the Bill today, tomorrow morning and on Thursday morning.  If we do not conclude the debate, so be it.  We have provided considerable parliamentary time for the debate, nor do I intend to rush the Bill in the Seanad should it reach the Upper House.  I do not know what will be the arrangements in the Seanad as they will depend on what happens in this House in the near future.  I want to ensure we have sufficient time to debate the issues and I hope that will be the case.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the national strategy for higher education for the period until 2030 recommended significant reforms to position the institutes of technology sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the strategy recommended consolidation in the sector and a pathway of evolution for consolidated institutes of technology, should they so wish, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.  I stress again that there is no obligation on institutes of technology to take this route.  The Bill, in providing that applications for technological university status can be made only by merged institutes of technology, simply reflects this long-standing policy.<\/p>  <p>  The technological university process is not a rebranding process for the institutes of technology sector.  We will continue to have institutes of technology after groups of institutes proceed to technological university status.  We very much value the institutes of technology and are offering an opportunity, should institutions so wish, to start on the path of becoming technology universities.  Each group will be given an indication, when it moves from stage of the process to the next, as to whether it is on the right path to ensure it is aware of what bar it must reach to become a technological university.  Technological university status can be achieved only by merged institutes of technology.  This policy has been in place for some time and was included in the criteria from the outset.  <\/p>  <p>  The technological university process will require a step change in the performance of the institutes in question in order that they can meet the robust performance criteria, details of which have been in the public domain since 2012.  By merging, institutes of technology can achieve greater scale and an increased capacity to provide the quality of education and research which will allow the new institutions to provide an exceptional service to their students and the regions in which they are situated and to compete at an international level.  They must reach bars that have been set with regard to research, quality of teaching and so forth if they are to be granted technological university status.  <\/p>  <p>  For the reasons I have outlined I cannot support amendments Nos. 3, 18 and 60 to 79, inclusive, in so far as they provide that applications for technological university status can be made by unmerged institutes of technology.  It has been clear since 2012 that mergers would be part of the conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of institutes of technology merging and then somehow failing to achieve technological university status, the Bill provides that this is a possibility.  This returns me to the earlier point that this proposal is not simply a rebranding exercise.  What is being created through designation as a technology university is a new type of university in Ireland.  To gain credibility nationally and internationally, the bar that has been set must be achieved.  The objective criteria for redesignation as a technological university, which are set out in section 38, were first published in 2012 and the consortiums concerned have had ample opportunity to assess their progress against these criteria.  The Dublin and Munster consortiums have both been positively assessed by an international expert panel as being on a clear trajectory to meet the criteria.  I expect, therefore, that any consortium seeking to merge under the Bill would assess current performance and develop its own trajectory to achieve the level required by the technological university criteria before it applies to merge.  As such, institutes of technology which have not yet proceeded to that point should ensure they are comfortable with the criteria they must achieve.  These have been set out in respect of every step of the process.  That is the purpose of providing this information.  <\/p><p>Reference has been made to the argument that the merging of institutes of technology is simply a ruse to allow for rationalisation and cost saving.  That is absolutely not the case.<\/p> <p> I wish to touch on the issue of geographical equality or inequality raised by Deputy O'Brien.  Merged institutes will be multi-campus entities which will continue to provide a broad range of programmes of education and training in each of their campuses.  Indeed, by creating institutions of greater scale and strength, high-quality multi-campus technological universities will be able to bring greater social and economic benefits to their respective regions.<\/p> <p> I have had discussions with TUI representatives as well as public representatives in areas where there are merging institutions.  Like Deputy O'Brien, they have raised the point around certain young people from a given area.  For example, perhaps no one from the family has gone on to higher education, yet these people may have done so because there was an institute of technology in their local area.  I am very conscious of that and I have no wish to put anything in the way of people in those areas to prevent them from continuing to look at their campus as their campus in their community.  There is no intention to water that down in any way.  The regional focus of the technological universities is clearly set out in the Bill.  In particular, section 22 sets out the overall functions of a technological university.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 60, proposed by Deputy O'Brien, seeks additional amendments to the criteria over and above the deletion of the word \"merged\".  Firstly, the amendment includes a reference to \"community development organisations\" and \"learners\" in the proposed section 38(1)(k)(iv).  This criterion reflects the function of a technological university to develop programmes with the involvement of business, enterprise, the professions and other related stakeholders, which is part of the distinctive mission of a technological university.  This is specifically about the programmes.  We will be addressing the issues of community later, but this particular subsection is about the programmes they are developing.  Similarly, the proposal to delete subsection (2)(b) from the criteria, which relates to this involvement, would go against the mission of a technological university.  The amendment also seeks to amend the same subsection and include a reference to programmes being developed in a time and place to suit their needs.  I note that the functions of a technological university at section 22(1)(b) provide that technological universities will provide programmes that reflect the needs of citizens and other stakeholders in the region in which the campuses of the technological university are located as well as facilitating learning by flexible means.  Having given this issue careful consideration, I believe that the existing provision addresses the concerns raised by Deputy O'Brien, and I cannot support amendment No. 60 for that reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600036#JJ00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453835100,"counter":490,"content":"<p>This is Report Stage and therefore each Member can speak twice.

However, by bringing in this Bill the Minister is going from a two-tier system involving universities and institutes of technology to a three-tier system involving universities, technological universities and institutes of technology that will not be part of the process, such as the institute in the Minister's constituency.  That institute has decided to opt out and remain as an IOT, yet it will be governed by many of the issues relevant to this Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister said that the Bill would allow technological universities to operate on a greater scale and allow them the capacity to compete at an international level.  In itself, that may be the case, but the organisations cannot compete at an international level or operate with a greater scale and capacity unless they have the resources to match.  We can merge institutes, but unless we actually put the funding in place to enable them to increase their capacity and operate at a greater scale, then I do not believe the policy can work.  In my opening contribution I went through the cuts to the sector.  Funding was cut by &euro;190 million over seven years.  There was a reduction in the number of staff by almost 6% and a reduction of 20,000 students.  We can only imagine the additional resource implications for a merged institute with no guarantee of obtaining technological university status.<\/p><p>The Minister said this was not a rebranding exercise.  However, the question being asked is whether it is an exercise in rationalisation.  I have not heard any convincing argument from the Minister to the effect that this is not simply about rationalisation.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the Munster technological university consortium.  I am familiar with the MTU consortium.  There are major issues around the process in this case.  If the Bill passes in its current form, we could end up with a merged institute applying for technological university status while still having industrial relations disputes involving members of staff.  There is industrial action on the way in the Cork and Kerry case.  To the best of my knowledge and on the basis of my discussions with members of the TUI in Cork and Kerry, there has been a significant lack of meaningful consultation and engagement.  Those involved are seriously disappointed with the level of consultation provided.  Despite the Minister's engagements with the TUI at a national level, those involved believe the process has involved providing information rather than actually listening to most of their concerns.<\/p><p>I made reference to multi-campus organisations and set out the fears among some communities that assets may be stripped.  I do not believe the Minister's answer on the suggestion that the merged institutes of technology would be multi-campus organisations.  Let us consider the Cork and Kerry example.  A new entity could retain many of the assets and the buildings in Tralee as well as Cork.  However, there is an issue with the criteria for the duplication of courses.  To the best of my recollection, there is a specific reference to the effect that the duplication of courses should be eradicated.  Let us consider a scenario whereby someone from Cork is currently able to access a course in Cork Institute of Technology.  Then, when the merged institutes form a technological university, what happens if that particular course is also being provided in Tralee Institute of Technology?  Under this Bill, there would be an argument to the effect that the new entity would have to do away with at least one of those courses in one of the campuses.  We could have a situation whereby someone who is currently able to access a course in Cork may no longer be able to access that course and would have to travel to Tralee or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The multi-campus argument does not add up in respect of the point about the provision of courses.  That is one of the reasons for the concerns around the reduction in the number of courses.<\/p><p>I have tabled amendment No. 60 because we are proposing to remove the word &quot;merged&quot; or &quot;merger&quot; and, therefore, we would need entirely new eligibility criteria.  This is what we have provided in our amendment.  We have set out new eligibility criteria based on the requirement for institutes to have merged before they can obtain technological university status.  It is not simply about tinkering with one or two subsections; it is about creating altogether new criteria.<\/p><p>The Minister will argue that we cannot make such a change at this stage because the criteria have been laid out and some of the proposed technological universities are so far down the line that it would be unfair on them to change the criteria in mid-stream.  I imagine that is the Minister's opinion.  However, if the criteria are flawed, they are flawed.  Whether the necessary changes take place mid-stream or at the beginning, we need to get the criteria right, and I do not believe the Minister has got the criteria right in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600037#KK00300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1453835100,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We agree on the value of the institutes of technology.

Their connections with PLC colleges were invaluable.  <\/p> <p> The concerns are that those IOTs that do not merge will be at a disadvantage.  As Deputy O'Brien said, certain colleges offer the same courses.  If a particular college no longer offers a course it means that students will have to move from one campus to another, which undermines the regional basis of IOTs.  It also creates a funding issue and affects SUSI grants.  Students in Cork IT may not receive a grant that would enable them to attend Tralee IT and stay there because of the grant situation.<\/p> <p> There is another issue regarding those working on PhDs.  Doing a PhD requires considerable finances and time.  I do not think that issue has been taken into account.

How can she ensure that when there is a requirement on IOTs to merge that part of their achievements, namely, increasing participation levels within their regions, will not be eroded by the consolidation of courses?  It is a real concern of those in the regions and individual institutes of technology.  When they see the structure of the Bill and the erosion of local input into their IOTs within the wider merged technological universities, there is inevitable concern that courses will be consolidated away from local campuses and, as a result, there will be a reduction in the participation levels of local students, something into which great inroads have been made in recent years.

I refer to the general point on access.  On ensuring that students who currently attend institutes of technologies in the region and the concern that somehow the numbers might decline or less encouragement would be given, I wish to categorically state that is not the intention of the Bill.  In fact, the Department is planning for consistent increases in the number of students that will attend higher and further education over the next decade.  It is policy to provide those options.  Obviously, it is also policy to provide other options, like apprenticeships and so on, but that choice should be available to students.<\/p>  <p>  In my previous contribution I said we committed, as per section 22 of the Bill, to retaining the regional element.  Just because institutions are merged does not mean the focus on individual campuses is in any way deleted.  Separate individual campuses will be retained in the merged institutions with, I expect, increased numbers of students for individual campuses, whether they are individual IOTs that remain separate or are merged and subsequently become technological universities in conjunction with other institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to repeat what I said.  It would not be fair to change the criteria mid-stream, when it was very clear to anybody who was involved in, or stayed out, of the process that mergers were one of the criteria.  It remains one of the criteria and, therefore, we cannot say that an IOT does not need to merge in order to meet the criteria.  It is one of the criteria that was very clearly explained at the time; it was not hidden.<\/p>  <p>  We have already provided extra resources this year to facilitate the process.  There is no intention of using this as a way to cut down on the resources available to the sector.  There were some resource elements to the process, but they mainly involved ensuring there was proper consultation.  For example, the institutes in the Munster region have agreed to free up four trade union representatives on a full-time basis.  There is a problem with that because I understand the TUI does not trust the process.  We have asked the institutions to free up the staff members concerned and they have agreed.  The Department, the Higher Education Authority and I have reiterated time and again to the institutions concerned that they need to consult properly with their staff, academic and otherwise.  We will reiterate the point if there is some doubt that is not actually happening.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to SUSI.  We will address the issue.  She suggested students would not receive the non-adjacent rate if, for example, they lived in Cork and attended Tralee because they were adjacent to the Cork campus.  That issue will be dealt with by SUSI to ensure that if the campus in which students' courses are situated are far away enough from their homes to qualify under the current system for the non-adjacent rate that they will qualify for the correct rate.  I would not want any students to be disadvantaged in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012600038#LL00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1453835700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>We will not reach agreement on this.  That is the reality of Government and Opposition.  Genuine concerns have not been addressed and that has led to a situation whereby industrial action is taking place, such as those involved in the Munster technological university proposal.

Ultimately, these are the people that will be asked to deliver the high-quality education the Minister stated will be the result of merging institutes to form technological universities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has not addressed the issue of the duplication of courses.  From reading the documentation, I understand that one of the objectives is to remove course duplication.  If the Minister said today that is not the case, perhaps she could be clearer.  My understanding is that it is one of the major concern.  For instance, if Tralee and Cork both provide the same course and are merged into a technological university, specific campuses would focus on specific areas.  Tralee might focus on catering, food and beverage courses and Cork might focus more on metalwork and engineering.  Therefore, the courses which are currently provided in both institutes would be eradicated. <\/p>  <p>  We would end up with campuses focusing on particular areas of excellence or expertise.  If that is the case, the issue raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, namely, SUSI grants and the ability of students to travel comes into play.  Those living in Cork can do practically every course they want in CIT, but under a merged entity, that is, a technological university, there is no guarantee that will remain the case.
