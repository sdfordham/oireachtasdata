This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. To date, 671 cases have been submitted by lenders. Of these, 332 are currently being processed, and 181 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender. Sales have been agreed on 16 properties, and 8 of these have now been completed.

It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[5077\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to divide the proposed new legal regime for climate policy into two pieces of legislation, namely the Low Carbon Bill and the Climate Change Bill as referenced by the Taoiseach on 22 January 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Prior ity Question No. 132 on today&rsquo;s order paper.

This proved to be a very complex investigation and, on foot of its initial findings and in the context of the Department&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that RDP funding is delivered in an efficient and effective way, a decision was made to suspend project approvals by the Partnership on 7 March 2012.

The deadline for householders to register was 1 February. At the passing of that deadline, applications in respect of the on-site wastewater treatment systems of 373,954 owners, who have registered online, by post or in person at their local authority offices, had bee n processed and approximately 25,000 additional registration applications were awaiting processing by the bureau operated by the Local Government Management Agency.  I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of the number of processed registrations for each County and City Council by 1 February 2013.<\/p><p>The 2012 Act also provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems. I expect that the National Inspection Plan will be published shortly, and that inspections will commence in the middle of this year. Inspections will be carried out by appropriately qualified local authority staff who will be appointed as inspectors. A training course for inspectors is currently being finalised and it will be rolled out to all local authorities in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The extent and cost of the remediation works that may be required will depend on the condition of the individual system and the extent of the risk to public health and the environment. Inspections carried out by Cavan County Council, based on bye-laws adopted by that authority in 2004, revealed an initial failure rate of approximately 25% of on-site systems, with remediation costs averaging &euro;2,500. However, the enactment of the bye-laws and the related public information campaigns by Cavan County Council have increased householders&rsquo; awareness of the necessity to operate and maintain their systems correctly and the failure rate has, over the intervening years, decreased to approximately 15%. At this stage it is not possible to indicate how many systems will require remediation. However, t he remedial action required on foot of an inspection of a septic tank will, in many cases, only involve householders having to de-sludge their tanks more frequently.<\/p><p>I recently announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following inspection. The scheme will apply to treatment systems which have been registered by the due date of 1 February 2013 and which are deemed to require remediation having failed an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act. The grant payable will depend on the cost of the work necessary and the income of the household concerned , and t he scheme will provide a higher level of support to households on lower incomes.  Full details of the scheme will be defined in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing this year.<\/p><p>Registrations processed as of 4 February

The Walks Scheme was launched\u00a0in March 2008 on the recommendation of Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council). It represents an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails. The Scheme brings in landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the selected trails, in line with agreed work plans. It is currently operating on 40 trails supported by 1,811 landowners.<\/p><p>  My Department chairs regular meetings of Comhairle Na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) where matters are discussed   relating to rural recreation\/activity tourism and furthering the implementation of the priorities of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS). Comhairle Na Tuaithe was established in February 2004 with a primary focus on the following priority areas; access to the countryside, developing a countryside code and developing a countryside recreation strategy. It comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside.<\/p><p>  My Department is continuing negotiations with a number of State Agencies to agree a National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland . It is intended to put in place a structure to ensure coordinated and appropriate development of State lands for recreation and activity tourism purposes. Over 15% of the lands and waters in the State are under the control of various Agencies and Departments and offer significant potential for further development. A coordinated approach will facilitate greater efficiency in the use of existing resources and support professional development of those working in the sector. In addition, my Department is a main funding partner of Leave No Trace Ireland which promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors. It encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act responsibl y in the outdoors and to do their part to protect those lands used by the public for the benefit of the environment and for future generations.<\/p><p>  A Mountain Access scheme is under development. It is intended to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities. A pilot scheme has be en   initiated at Mount Gable in Connemara and discussions are ongoing for a similar type scheme at Carrauntuohil , Co. Kerry, with the possibility of being extended to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks.Discussions with local landowners have been initiated and it is intended to progress consideration of the most appropriate management structures and funding mechanisms during the first half of 2013. To support the ongoing development of Mountain Access areas and to facilitate access to the countryside for other recreational pursuits, my Department is currently negotiating the implementation of a National Indemnity Scheme which would indemnify private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property. The Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim can be difficult. Perceptions regarding potential liability for claims from recreational users, due to injury or damage to personal property, have made access agreements more challenging . The proposed National Indemnity Scheme has the potential to address these perceptions and to unlock the latent potential of our countryside for recreation and activity tourism. This will support the economic development of rural communities and enhance employment capacity in those areas.<\/p><p>  The State Claims Agency , with the cooperation and support of my Department and other key State Agencies, has established an Irish branch of the Visitor Safety in the Countryside Group (VSCG). It will use and further develop best practice to achieve a safe and pleasant experience for outdoor enthusiasts and visitors to the countryside.  Discussions are ongoing with other key stakeholders and partners such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Trails Office regarding the development of greenways and cycleways and to secure better coordination and oversight of future proposed developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Panel Report Implementation","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04550"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[5083\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the basis on which the National Standards Authority of Ireland has been asked to report to his Department on the subject of pyrite testing; when this will be published; the consensus amongst stakeholders regarding the funding for testing for pyrite in properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[5069\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of recommendations of the report of the Pyrite Panel that have been implemented to date; the timeline for the implementation of the remaining recommendations; the legal mechanism through which the pyrite levy scheme will be established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[5079\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when a levy on the construction industry will be introduced as indicated following the publication of the pyrite panel report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[5578\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04850","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the timeframe for the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 158, 161 and 192 together.<\/p><p>  The report of the independent Pyrite Panel contains twenty four inter-related recommendations covering a broad range of issues. The recommendations can be broken into two categories, those dealing with the delivery of solutions to homeowners whose homes are affected by pyrite and who have no other option for redress, and recommendations to limit the occurrence of similar problems in the future and to enhance consumer protection. The implementation of many of the recommendations in the pyrite report requires the involvement and co-operation of a number of parties, and implementation will be on a progressive basis. Given their particular impact on affected homeowners, priority is being given to the recommendations around the delivery of a remediation process for affected homeowner , including funding for a remediation scheme, the establishment of a Pyrite Resolution Board , and the development of standards for the testing and categorisation of dwellings and for a remediation method statement.<\/p><p>  I have recently received Government approval for the imposition of a levy on both the quarrying and insurance sectors as a mechanism to provide the necessary funding for a remediation scheme. The imposition of these levies will require primary legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible. The Government also approved the establishment of a Resolution Board as recommended in the pyrite report. I am currently finalising membership of the Board. I have previously announced the appointment of the Chairman and I will announce the full Board membership shortly. The role of the Board will be to oversee the operation of the remediation scheme and to ensure that the public interest, and the interest of the affected homeowners, is well served.<\/p><p>  Reflecting the approach recommended in the report for the engagement of stakeholders in processes to provide a solution to the pyrite problem, my Department and I have been involved in on-going discussions with key stakeholders and in particular with representatives from the Construction Industry Federation, Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, and the Irish Banking Federation since July 2012. The Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation and HomeBond have agreed to establish an entity for the purposes of operating the remediation scheme in respect of those homes affected by pyrite. A number of financial institutions have agreed in principle to make initial loan funding available to facilitate the early commencement of pyrite remediation work and it is intended that the entity will engage with those institutions in relation to the loan facility.<\/p><p> In July 2012, shortly after receiving the pyrite report, I asked the National Standards Authority of I eland (NSAI) to undertake the development of protocols for the testing and categorisation of dwellings and for a remediation statement as recommended in the report. I am pleased that the NSAI fast-tracked this work and the two new standards were published on 29 January 2013. Their publication represents another important step in the advancement and implementation of solutions for homeowners. In October 2012, the NSAI announced the review and development of the existing specification for unbound granular fill (hardcore) for use under concrete floors and sought submissions from the public. This work will now progress and I look forward to its completion which will represent an important safeguard for consumers in the future. The new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, currently being finalised, require the submission of compliance documentation to Local Authorities and inspection and certification of building works by registered professionals providing an added level of consumer protection. This is in line with recommendations in the pyrite report. Work is underway on the scope and the terms and conditions of the remediation scheme and the cost of testing will be dealt with in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":66,"content":"<p>Question No. 152 answered with Question No. 142.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Housing Sector","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA05050"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[5555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500052#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the measures he is taking to support voluntary housing bodies to develop their housing stock to meet rising demand and the increased difficulties in sourcing finance.","asker":"981","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>Approved housing bodies (AHBs) are identified in the Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement as key partners in the delivery of social housing.

In distributing Local Property Tax income to local authorities through the Local Government Fund, I will seek to ensure that a significant element of the tax is retained in the local authority area in which it is collected in order to fund essential local services in our communities.   <\/p><p>Currently, general purpose grants from the local government fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time: that is , a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.    Local authority cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.   <\/p><p>In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability .   <\/p><p>In time, local authorities may vary the local rate of the Local Property Tax. This function will improve the governance of local authorities by strengthening their accountability to local taxpayers. The tax will alter the relationship between the citizen and his or her local authority in a way which will be altogether beneficial for good governance. As noted in the Action Plan for Effective Local Government, Putting People First, if local elected members have relatively little responsibility for raising revenue, their rigorousness in prioritising its allocation, overseeing its efficient use and stewardship, and oversight in relation to the performance and management of local authority operations generally, is likely to be diminished.   <\/p><p>Currently, different local authorities vary in their degree of dependence on the local government fund. Differences in population densities and settlement patterns will, of course, have an impact on the extent to which a given local authority will be funded by the Local Property Tax.

In this context and on the basis of extrapolations from the annual levels of expenditure to date it is estimated that the final programme complement will be approximately &euro;370 million.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>   RDP Measure<\/div><\/th><th><div>Current Project Allocation           (&#8364;314  Complement)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Estimated final  Project Allocation             (&#8364;370  Complement)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Commitments<\/div><\/th><th><div>Expenditure<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>311 - Diversification<\/td><td><div>&#8364;12,265,335.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;14,387,209.71<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,373,944.36<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;5,362,320.07<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>312 - Business creation<\/td><td><div>&#8364;35,529,718.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;41,676,274.94<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;26,142,749.89<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;13,072,341.54<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>313 - Tourism<\/td><td><div>&#8364;33,424,144.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;39,206,441.83<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;28,586,519.79<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;11,192,613.34<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>321 - Basic Services<\/td><td><div>&#8364;36,523,608.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;42,842,105.26<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;42,066,027.83<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;17,491,311.71<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>322 - Village renewal<\/td><td><div>&#8364;39,902,833.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;46,805,928.35<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;32,365,436.04<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;19,054,932.96<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>323 - Conservation and upgrading<\/td><td><div>&#8364;39,645,158.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;46,503,676.04<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;18,984,266.07<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;9,188,798.90<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>331 - Training<\/td><td><div>&#8364;21,681,521.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;25,432,372.51<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;16,162,343.49<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;5,074,824.32<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>341 - Skills acquisition, animation<\/td><td><div>&#8364;25,495,113.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;29,905,706.62<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;6,843,665.21<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;894,170.35<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>421 - Co-operation<\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,877,496.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;9,240,284.75<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;4,488,603.22<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;762,369.70<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>&#8364;252,344,926.00<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;296,000,000.01<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;183,013,555.90<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;82,093,682.89<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Presidency Agenda","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[5573\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his priorities for the EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s EU Presidency priorities fall under three broad headings &ndash; strategy, legislation and the international agenda.   <\/p><p>On strategy, my main focus is on the 7 Environment Action Programme which sets out the priority objectives for EU environment policy for the next ten years.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, the projected outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.\u00a0However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.  <\/p><p>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.

These powers include the power to refuse to allocate, or to refuse to sell, a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour and the power to seek a court order excluding a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from entering a local authority dwelling or estate for a period of up to 3 years. Each housing authority also has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute;, who have a range of measures in place to deal with allegations of such behaviour generally.   <\/p><p>I intend to commence section 29 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 this year and to make the necessary regulations to give effect to the Programme for Government   commitment to introduce a 12-month probationary tenancy for all new social housing tenants, which will include provision for termination in the event of anti-social behaviour. <\/p><p>Proposals for new housing legislation currently being developed in my Department will include a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which will be designed to enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households engaged in anti-social behaviour. I am also   examining the scope for making the excluding order powers of housing authorities   more effective in tackling anti-social behaviour without having to evict entire families from their homes. I n the context of the new legislation, I am giving particular consideration to the issue of anti-social behaviour in the arrangements to be made for transferring responsibility for rent supplement households with an established long-term housing need from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.   <\/p><p>While action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of private residential estates and complexes, under Section 15 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 a landlord of a dwelling owes a duty to enforce the obligations of the tenant to each person who could be potentially affected by the breach of those obligations.   <\/p><p>The Act specifically prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour. This termination is subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.   <\/p><p>Section 77 of the Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party who is directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. It also allows the PRTB to furnish the name and address of the landlord concerned to a person who proposes to make such a complaint. However, the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned before referring the complaint to the PRTB.   <\/p><p>The effectiveness of these provisions was clearly demonstrated in a recent case taken in Cork against the landlord of two properties the tenants of which were found to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. A group of 13 residents took a case to the PRTB and were awarded combined damages of just under &euro;30,000 against the landlord for his failure to address the behaviour of his tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Security of the Elderly","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB04950"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[5589\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500053#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the funding being provided for the seniors alert scheme in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>The Seniors Alert Scheme provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of equipment to enable older persons, without sufficient means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

Most local authorities have now prepared watermains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair, and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years. The primary objective of this programme of work is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water. Over time, this investment coupled with ongoing active leakage control should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and improve service to customers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The proposed water metering programme will complement the continuing programme of investment in water mains rehabilitation and replacement. The installation of water meters will encourage households to conserve water, reduce consumption and ensure that customer side leaks can be identified and fixed.

The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas (particularly in Britain and the United States), reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.  <\/p><p>  Under the ESP grants are allocated to a range of non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and encourage closer links between these communities and Ireland. <\/p><p>  These grants are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to developing strong and meaningful links with Irish communities overseas and to securing the long term future of these communities. In recent years, as the demographic profile of our overseas communities has changed, there has also been an increased focus on funding community, heritage and capital projects. As part of this, grants have been approved for strategic capital projects.   <\/p><p>  Since 2004, the total budget for the Department of Foreign Affair&rsquo;s ESP, which supports Irish welfare, culture and heritage organisations abroad, has been in excess of &euro;104 million.

Funding is not provided to cover salaries, overseas travel, events which have already taken place, or for capital costs. <\/p><p>  Approximately 140 grants are awarded per year to support projects which best fit the eligibility criteria of the Funds.

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  <\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election. The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.<\/p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary   of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   I will also hold a series of telephone discussions with key US Senators over the coming days.    The Taoiseach also discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election and wrote to him on 30 January to thank him for the priority being attached by the US Administration to the issue. <\/p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.

Sanctions have been placed on some Iranian financial institutions because of their involvement in supporting the nuclear and military programmes, or their involvement in evading sanctions or money-laundering. While this has meant some inconvenience for non-sanctioned commerce, there are specific exemptions in place in the financial sanctions in both the EU and the US for transactions relating to medicines.   There have been anecdotal reports in some media about possible shortages of some medicines in Iran. I would indeed be deeply concerned if I felt this was due to sanctions, but no real grounds have been advanced for concluding thus. There has been, and continues to be, considerable discussion and work within the EU on monitoring and fine-tuning the sanctions to ensure this does not occur, and both in the EU and the US the details of sanctions and controls have been adjusted to avoid possible problems which were foreseen. This process will continue, and Ireland will continue to play an active role in these discussions, based on ensuring that all legitimate trade with Iran is facilitated and all necessary humanitarian exemptions are provided. <\/p><p>  There are a number of very important points which also need to be remembered in relation to this issue.  The sole purpose of sanctions is to persuade Iran to negotiate seriously on the issues of concern in relation to its nuclear programme.

The ADF assists development in the poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific by providing low-interest loans and grants to fight poverty.

Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013) which is published on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie  ) includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.<\/p><p>This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p>Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organized crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.<\/p><p>Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade. Details of the quantities of cigarettes seized each year since 2005 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Quantity of cigarettes seized (millions)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>51.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>52.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>74.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>135.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>218.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>178.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>109.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>95.6<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures. For example, the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2009 includes one seizure of some 120 million cigarettes that were uncovered on a vessel at Greenore, Co. Louth. This was the largest seizure of cigarettes ever recorded by any EU country, and it would be unrealistic to gauge the numbers of seizures in subsequent years by reference to this exceptional event.<\/p><p>Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit products are achieved on an ongoing basis and will ensure that this work continues to have the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.<\/p><p>There has been considerable success also in detecting and prosecuting those involved in the illicit trade. In 2012, there were 57 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in fines of &euro;93,550 and 26 custodial sentences, 7 of which were suspended. There were, in addition, 75 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in fines of &euro;153,050 and 21 custodial sentences, 14 of which were suspended.<\/p><p>Revenue is conscious that those involved in the illegal trade in tobacco are constantly striving to avoid detection by seeking out new ways of smuggling the illicit product and putting it on the market, and that its own response needs to be agile and adaptive in combating this criminal activity to take account of this.<\/p><p>In relation to staff numbers I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on customs work or on policing illegal cigarette smuggling. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.  Revenue&rsquo;s overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581(FTE) at the end of  2008 to its current level of 5,745 (FTE).  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade and they are committed to ensuring that despite the staff reductions that this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500055#WRD05400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-IMF Agreement","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500055#WRD05450"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[5100\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500055#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is any evidence that the formal programme of assistance with the EU\/ECB\/IMF of December 2010 or any of the supporting documents included a condition by the Troika or a commitment from the Government that all remaining unguaranteed senior bondholders in the covered institutions will be repaid in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>There is no specific reference to this in the programme documentation.

However, the Government decided that while the NPPR will be collected in 2013 when a half-year LPT will apply, it should be discontinued thereafter.  There is no exemption from the LPT for those who are liable for the NPPR.<\/p><p>  As set out in the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, liability to pay the NPPR is determined on the basis of ownership of the property in question on the &quot;liability date&quot; which is 31 March for 2013.  The LPT does not come into effect until 1 July 2013. The Government decided to extend the NPPR into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities pending the introduction of the full LPT.<\/p><p>  Residential properties rented by landlords will be subject to Local Property Tax from 1 July 2013, with the owners of the property &ndash; in those cases, the landlord &ndash; being the liable person for payment of the tax. The Thornhill Group, the inter-departmental group, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill, established to consider the structures and modalities of a property tax, recommended that owners and not occupiers be the liable persons for the Local Property Tax.  This was also the view of the 2009 Commission on Taxation.  Given that some rental properties have high tenant turnover, which would present significant difficulties in determining liability and collecting taxes, as well as increasing the cost of collecting the tax, the Government accepted this recommendation.  Occupier liability may also give rise to perceptions of unfairness if the occupier on the valuation date (i.e. the date at which occupation of the property is deemed by law to create the tax liability) is no longer the occupier on the date at which payment of the tax becomes due.  <\/p><p>  The Local Property Tax is not an allowable deduction from rental profit for tax purposes.  This is the same treatment which applied to the Household Charge and the NPPR Charge.  It is, however, proposed to phase in deductibility of the Local Property Tax.<\/p><p>  Water charges are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500056#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500056#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[5290\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500056#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"following a news report on Sunday 27 January that a company (details supplied) paid no tax here despite &euro;57 million in revenues in its most recent financial year and a net profit, because of a series of facilitating tax allowances, if he will list the number of companies by name which are currently operational or headquartered here but are paying no tax to the Irish Exchequer.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>The tax affairs of individual companies are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the companies concerned.

Chaired by Revenue, it is a multilateral group comprising of representatives of IBEC, SFA, CIF, ICTU and SIPTU, Government agencies, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency.  Its terms of reference are to provide a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Agency and representative bodies of employers, unions and industry, and to prepare a brief report on its activities each year for presentation to the Department of an Taoiseach.<\/p><p>  The group met three or four times a year between 1990 and 2011 and contributed to the establishment of multi-agency investigation units, producing a &quot;Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&quot;, and in 2007 sponsored legislation which provided for the exchange of employment information on the earned income of individuals between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, the first steps into information exchange.  Under its terms of reference, the Group prepares a written annual report that is presented to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 2011 the Group reviewed its own effectiveness and ability to deliver, in accordance with its terms of reference, and reached the conclusion that its would be better served by operating at a more local level, utilising resources more familiar with the difficulties that were being experienced by small and medium sized enterprises and unions locally and using local Government agency resources to arrive at workable solutions.<\/p><p>  In November 2011, the full HEMG devolved its terms of reference to four regionally based liaison groups, namely the Border Midlands West, Dublin, East &amp; South East and South West Hidden Economy Monitoring Liaison Groups, with a requirement that all groups meet regularly and provide reports as required to the HEMG.  The constituent members of the Regional Liaison Groups nominated were locally based members of the original attendee representative bodies and agencies, with the meetings organised and chaired by Revenue officials.  The four Regional Liaison Groups met a total of 11 times during 2012.  The 2012 report of the HEMG is currently being prepared.  On 30 January 2013 the full HEMG met to review the effectiveness of the first year of operations of the Regional Liaison Groups and to see what supports could be put in place to achieve and sustain improved outcomes from the work of the Groups.  In order to make the HEMG more representative it was expanded to include a number of other interested representative bodies such as ISME and Retail Ireland.

I understand that most of the various bodies that comprise the voluntary and co-operative sector in respect of the provision of social housing would have been approved for charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners.

Such groups also provide general needs housing in the same way as a local authority provides such housing.

The Chapter imposes a limit or ceiling on the total capital value of pension benefits that an individual can draw upon in their lifetime from tax-relieved pension products where those benefits come into payment for the first time on or after 7 December 2005. This limit is known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) and is set at &euro;2.3 million as on and from 7 December 2010. In certain circumstances, a higher threshold called a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) may apply.   Section 787Q deals with the concept of the &ldquo;chargeable excess&rdquo; and, among other things, with the arrangements for the recovery of tax paid upfront on a chargeable excess by a pension administrator in the public service. The SFT was introduced as a deterrent to prevent over-funding of supplementary pension provision from tax-relieved sources and there are penal tax consequences where benefits are taken from pension funds which exceed the SFT or a PFT, where applicable. There is an immediate ring-fenced tax charge of 41% on the &ldquo;chargeable excess&rdquo; over the value of the SFT or PFT. Furthermore, the remaining amount is taxed again at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate when taken as retirement benefits.<\/p><p>  The SFT regime operates as it is intended to do in the private sector to deter over-funding of pensions, as individuals have the flexibility (which they generally exercise) to cease contributing to or accruing benefits under pension arrangements in order to avoid exceeding the SFT or the PFT, if applicable.<\/p><p>  The situation is different for individuals in public service pension schemes who cannot opt-out of the schemes and have no control over their accrual of public service pension entitlements (other than to leave their jobs). Simply by continuing in their posts, a significant chargeable excess and tax liability could arise for certain individuals at the point at which they retire from the public service pension scheme. This situation is unlikely to arise in the private sector. It should also be borne in mind that in public service schemes there is generally no actual pension fund available out of which the tax liability can be met. For these various reasons, section 787Q sets out arrangements for the reimbursement of the administrator for tax paid on a chargeable excess in respect of a retiree in a public service context. This reimbursement can be effected by a reduction in the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual from the public service scheme, by recoupment directly from the individual, by recovery from the gross public service pension over a period or by a combination of these approaches.<\/p><p>  I have not been made aware of similar difficulties to those that I have described above in a public service context arising in the private sector. If such difficulties exist and are outlined to me, I will examine the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500058#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500058#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[5431\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500058#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review the decision of the Revenue Commissioners not to reduce a tax interest liability for late payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim.","asker":"1082","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of a range of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer. Revenue has a clear focus on making sure that every person and business complies with the requirement to file the relevant returns and to pay the appropriate tax or duty on a timely basis. That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due, adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses. In instances where taxpayers or businesses pay their taxes late then interest on late payment, which is a statutory charge is applied. This is designed to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue suffered as a result of the late payment and to encourage timely payments in future. Revenue applies a balanced approach to the imposition of interest on late payment and ensures that customers are made fully aware that by paying late they risk being charged interest.   I am informed by Revenue that the interest on late payment charge in question relates to the 2010 tax year and that the person was obliged under self assessment rules to pay preliminary tax for that year at an amount equal to either 100% of his final 2009 liability or 90% of his eventual 2010 liability on or before 31 October 2010.  The person did not make the required payment within the statutory timeframe but did eventually make the payments on a phased basis between 17 November 2011 and 8 February 2012. Because the payments were made well outside of the statutory timeframe the person was charged interest on late payment of &#8364;7,701.28. <\/p><p><br \/>  Unfortunately the person also breached preliminary tax payment rules in 2005 and 2009 and on those occasions suffered interest on late payment charges of &#8364;6,320.86 and &#8364;1,580.17 respectively. It is also noted that the person has again failed to adhere to preliminary tax rules for 2011 and has paid no preliminary tax for 2012 to date.<\/p><p>The Collector General&#8217;s Division of the Revenue Commissioners recently reviewed the application of interest on late payment against the 2010 tax year at the request of the person in question but found no grounds to mitigate the charge given the person&#8217;s track record of late payment. However if payment of the debt in one lump sum creates an undue burden on the person, then Revenue would be prepared to consider payment by way of an agreed phased payment plan.

The common budgetary timeline also foresees that the final budget should be adopted or fixed upon annually by 31 December.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, much of our existing budgetary process, which is currently completed in the first week of December, will have to be finalised earlier in the year. <\/p><p>  As the two-pack has not yet been adopted, this requirement has not yet come into force but I can assure the Deputy that we will take the necessary actions to ensure that Ireland will comply with the new requirements once they have been agreed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":423,"content":"<p>Question Nos. 286 to 288, inclusive, answered with Question No. 234.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH00450"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[5951\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an increase in the standard variable rate mortgages by .25% by a bank (details supplied); if his Department consulted with this bank on the matter and the effect this increase will have on mortgage holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in the setting of the standard variable mortgage interest rates charged by regulated financial institutions.

There is no specific exemption from the Local Property Tax for the type of cases outlined in the question from the Deputy.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessment tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property and the impact of serious and regular flooding on a property would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property. <\/p><p>  In addition, one of the advantages of the banding system of values provided for in the legislation is to remove the need for precision in relation to the market value, except for properties worth over &euro;1million.

Therefore, if there has been a major increase in claims in a particular area, then this will be reflected in an increase in premiums.   Competition in the market place acts as a constraint in such circumstances, however insurance companies have always to be conscious of their prudential obligations and are required by the Central Bank of Ireland to meet their capital requirements on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the sustainability of their business.  In these circumstances when they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is inevitable that their capital position will suffer and put pressure on prices. <\/p><p>  It is worth noting that past initiatives, in particular the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety which has reduced accidents significantly still continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level. <\/p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that the ability of the Government to influence the competitiveness of insurance costs is limited as neither I as Minister for neither Finance nor the Central Bank can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Grants","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[5286\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500059#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of money disbursed in grant aid in each of the years 2000 to 2012 by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences and the Irish Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology, and to detail such disbursements by scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>The position is that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available at this stage.

It is also worth pointing out that, as part of last years budgetary measures, my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.My Department does not have the information sought by the Deputy. The day to day management of how teaching resources are used in schools is done at local school level. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.

The Plan included 48 rationalisation measures to be implemented by the end of 2012, as well as a further 46 critical reviews to take place by the end of June 2012, details of which are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>With regard to the 48 agency rationalisation measures outlined in Appendix IIa of the Public Service Reform Plan, significant progress has been made by the responsible parent Departments on the implementation of these measures.  The latest position on these measures to reflect progress to end Q4 2012 is included in the table in Appendix 1.  Further detail or queries on this progress should be sought from the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will see from the table, the Commission on Public Service Appointments merger with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office, both of which are under the aegis of my Department, was completed and is legislated for in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.<\/p><p>Other rationalisation measures may also have occurred outside or prior to the Public Service Reform Plan, these rationalisation measures are a matter for the individual Departments and should be directed to the relevant Ministers.<\/p><p>With regard to further rationalisation measures to be introduced, I refer the Deputy to my answer to PQ 2813\/13 answered on Wednesday 23rd January, 2013, which outlines the results of the critical review process and further rationalisation measures to be implemented by end 2013.<\/p><p>Regarding savings, from the outset, I have maintained that the real benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  This will be of real and lasting benefit to all citizens, regardless of any headline figure on savings.<\/p><p>Specifically, the Public Service Reform Plan aimed to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the State Bodies affected.  This rationalisation programme is just one of the reform measures announced in the PSR plan and the Programme for Government which facilitates the Government in ensuring delivery of critical services while still being able to reduce public service numbers.<\/p><p>There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the number of State Bodies that still exist, as I have stated before in previous PQs, there are three broad categories of State Bodies.<\/p><p>Firstly, there are a number of Offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group.  A list of these bodies is set out in Appendix 2.<\/p><p>Secondly there are non-commercial State Bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department.  Details of such bodies are set out in the Detailed Expenditure Information on Non-Commercial State Agencies included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012, which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/per.gov.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/REV-2012-Final.pdf<\/i><\/p><p>Beyond that within each Department there are many other executive offices, divisions and directorates, operational or consultative groupings, task groups or forums that exist for various purposes that might or might not meet the definition of &lsquo;entity&rsquo;.  Many of these groups are transient in nature in response to the needs and business pressures of particular Departments and sectors and details of which would not be held centrally.  Questions on such bodies should be directed to the relevant Ministers.

The Campus Incubators are particularly important in providing a halfway house for academics who are transitioning towards launching a research spin-out, as well as providing initial incubation space for the entrepreneurs emerging successfully from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers entrepreneur development programme.<\/p><p>At present, there are 330 companies in campus incubation units across the country, employing about 1,500 people.  These start-ups are operating across a range of areas including software, environmental technologies and digital media.<\/p><p>EI has invested &euro;50m to date in the provision of campus incubation facilities across the state.  At this stage, all Universities and Institutes of Technology have on-campus incubators already built and operational, with the exception of the National University of Ireland Maynooth where an incubation facility is at the design stage, and DIT, who plan to build a facility on the Grangegorman campus.<\/p><p>In total in 2013 &euro;1m is expected to paid in respect of campus incubation activities.<\/p><p><b>IDA Ireland<\/b><\/p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Capital allocation for 2013 provides funding towards IDA&rsquo;s property function and grant payments.<\/p><p>The grant payments provided for in 2013 are in relation to projects which have been approved in previous years.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   <\/p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  <\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Review did not analyse the economic contribution generally of the self-employed, or indeed any other group, vis a vis their entitlements to benefits under the social insurance scheme as these benefits are linked to the level of contributions made.  The report of the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  Therefore in terms of the pension entitlements, the report concludes that the self-employed achieve very good value for money in terms of the PRSI contributions paid.   <\/p><p>  The Review also addressed the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The Review found that an incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  Self-employed workers whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand or who do not have constant or continuous employment, may access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.

The appeals process <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers and are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed <\/font>(54% in 2012<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">) is evidence of the <\/font>independence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. There was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012 and processing times have been reduced by an 7.8 weeks overall in 2012 with time for an oral hearing time down by 18.2 weeks and the time for summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.

In that regard<\/p><p>-  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012;<\/p><p>- There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals;<\/p><p>-  It is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013 which will assist in reducing the time taken for appeals where a medical assessment is required.<\/p><p> All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.<\/p><p><br \/>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings.

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest poverty rates (at 0.9%)  and are least likely to be at risk of poverty (pointing to the adequacy of the State pension), nonetheless significant reform of our pensions systems are necessary to safeguard future sustainability and adequacy. <\/p><p>  A number of significant reforms to pensions have been introduced in recent years. In 2014, the State pension age will be standardised at 66 which will see the abolition of the State pension transition.  Thereafter State pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  In September 2012, a number of changes to the State pension rate bands came into effect for new customers.  A move to a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; for determining eligibility for the State pension is planned in 2020 to replace the current averaging system.  <\/p><p>  These reforms will ensure that the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over the working life.  Aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p><p>  Discussions on long term pension policy have identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of pensions policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system.  In this regard, the OECD has been commissioned by the Department of Social Protection to review long term pension policy in Ireland.  The review will take account of the Programme for Government commitments in the pensions area, including universal coverage, and is being informed by developments at EU level in relation to both pensions and increasing the labour market participation of older workers. <\/p><p>  The particular aspects being considered by the OECD include;<\/p><p>  - the sustainability of the pension system in the light of demographic and investment challenges;<\/p><p>  - the adequacy and coverage levels, in order to ensure adequate income in retirement with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group;<\/p><p>  - the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working;<\/p><p>  - equity within the pension system.<\/p><p>  The review is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2013. <\/p><p>  Significant developments have taken place in relation to defined benefit supplementary pensions.  Legislation enacted in 2012 strengthened the Funding Standard by introducing a requirement for schemes to develop a risk reserve from 2016 and to meet the reserve requirement in 2023.  In August 2012, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced details of the sale of over &euro;1billion of Irish Amortising Bonds which were purchased by pension schemes and welcomed pension funds into the economy.  Providers have also been introduced into the sovereign annuity market.   The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer. <\/p><p>  Last October, the Department of Social Protection, working with the Central Bank and the Pensions Board, published a report on pension charges which looked at whether charges are reasonable and transparent to members.  I invited interested parties to submit comments and observations regarding the report in the period to the end of January 2013.  Comments and observations submitted will inform considerations in relation to any further policy or regulatory action that may be required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500063#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[5226\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current waiting time for an application for jobseeker's benefit; the number of applicants currently waiting for their jobseeker's benefit application to be processed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[5227\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current waiting time for an application for jobseeker's allowance; the number of applicants are currently waiting for their jobseeker's allowance application to be processed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[5231\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current waiting time for an application for one parent family payment; the number of applicants currently waiting for their one parent family payment application to be processed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":786,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410, 411 and 415 together.<\/p><p>In 2012, a total of 432,557 claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and one-parent family payment were received in my Department&rsquo;s Local Offices.

Estimates at that time indicated that the gross estimated savings in 2014 were expected to be in the region of  &euro;33 million with a full year savings in 2015 of approximately &euro;65 million. These savings take into account claimants who would instead receive various other social welfare payments, including jobseeker benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":817,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN02650"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[5264\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500064#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on a domiciliary care scheme review will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":819,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 25 July 2012.

However, the steady increase in the numbers availing of illness and disability related income supports is clearly a matter for concern, in view of the fact that my Department will spend over &euro;2.5 billion in this area in 2013.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that there is little basis for suggesting that the rise in the numbers can be attributed to any easing of access to illness and disability-related income support schemes - beyond some minor changes to the means-test associated with disability allowance scheme and the extension of entitlement to that payment to persons resident in institutions, the medical criteria governing entitlement to illness and disability related schemes have not been changed - but it has been evident to me since coming into office that a greater focus is required on addressing the drift from short-term illness into long-term disability.  <\/p><p>  The capping of entitlement to Illness Benefit to a maximum of two years, a measure introduced in 2009, was an important step in this regard.  The impact of this measure is not reflected in the data cited in the article referred to by the Deputy which relies largely on data from 2010.  Measures such as the Renaissance project, which provides for intervention by the Medical Assessors in my Department in cases of lower back pain, are also proving effective at encouraging people to return to work and this approach has been extended to claimants presenting with mild anxiety and depression. <\/p><p>  More generally, it is my belief that for all claimants, the welfare system must always have a strong focus on activation and employment where that is a feasible option.  The partial capacity benefit scheme, which I introduced in 2012, enables claimants of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take up some work while continuing to receive income support from the State. Similarly, the earnings disregard available under the disability allowance scheme is designed to facilitate claimants of that payment to avail of employment opportunities. My Department also funds the EmployAbility service, which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities as well as providing a range of supports to employers who employ people with disabilities. Finally, I should mention also that I was pleased to announce recently the allocation of over &euro;7 million to 14 projects across the Border Midlands and West (BMW) region as part of the Disability Activation Project (DACT). These projects will run until early 2015. The DACT Project is jointly funded by the European Social Fund and my Department and addresses four strands: (i) Improving Access to Employment, (ii) Progression Programmes for Young People, (iii) Support for Progression and Retention of People with an Acquired Disability&rsquo; and (iv) Innovative Employer Initiatives. These projects will, I am confident, provide invaluable guidance and learning on how best to ensure that the untapped potential of people with disabilities is allowed to flourish and that they are enabled to participate fully in the labour market. They reflect also my key objectives as Minister for Social Protection which are to ensure that those in most need of the support of the Department are protected and that we do everything possible to get people back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":863,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 440 and 441 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Schemes","counter":864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO01150"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[5436\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the application for a place on a momentum course by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 1 will be reconsidered, taking into account that they have been unemployed since December 2010, apart from March to October 2012, when they received illness benefit, and in view of the fact that their eligibility would not be in doubt if they had not been sick for several months","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":866,"content":"<p>To qualify for the Momentum scheme, a customer must<\/p><p>- Be unemployed and on the Live Register for 12 months (312days) or longer, <i>and<\/i><\/p><p>- Be in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance\/Benefit or credited contributions for 12 months or longer, <i>and<\/i><\/p><p>- Be actively seeking work.<\/p><p><br \/>  Periods spent on JobBridge, Back to Education Allowance, VTOS, full time F&Aacute;S\/F&aacute;ilte Ireland Training courses, Youthreach, Community Employment Schemes, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme, Back to Work Scheme, Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, Job Initiative or Job Assist may count towards meeting the eligibility for MOMENTUM, provided the customer  has  completed the Scheme\/Programme in question and returned to the Live Register.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.<\/p><p>  Issues relating to changes in taxation policy are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However I can confirm that the Government has not announced any plans to implement means-testing or taxing child benefit at this time. Neither taxing child benefit nor means testing the payment are simple solutions as there is a range of policy, legal and operational issues that would have to be addressed if a decision was made to proceed along the lines of either approach. In terms of means testing there would be a need to ensure that systems are in place to ensure that households only claimed benefits to which they were entitled, as the scale of means testing approximately 600,000 families would be significantly greater than anything required by the current social protection system in terms of means tested payment. In terms of taxing the payment there are questions relating to the ownership of the benefit and the effects of taxing the payments in the context of the treatment of married and co-habiting couples. Both approaches would also require major development work to enhance Department of Social Protection and Revenue systems.<\/p><p>  On a more general level, achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established in 2011 an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will be published in the near future. Given that the issues involved in this area are quite complex further consideration will be required as to how reform in this area might be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO02650"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[5728\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500065#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total number of persons in receipt of jobseeker's benefit in 2010, 2011 and currently;

The scheme is available to approximately 400,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;211 million in 2013.<\/p><p>I am aware that any reduction in social welfare payments or benefits is difficult.  I also appreciate the important role that the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme play in promoting social inclusion and preventing isolation of older people and people with disabilities. However, to allow the Government to protect the core payments which people receive such as pensions, disability payments and carer&rsquo;s allowance, we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package.<\/p><p>It should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s older population has the lowest rate of consistent poverty and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.<\/p><p>The Government committed itself in the Programme for Government to protect welfare rates. These weekly welfare rates were maintained in Budgets 2012 and 2013. All of the schemes operated by my Department, including the household benefits package and fuel allowance are kept under review given the on-going need for savings and to target expenditure at those most in need.<\/p><p>The following changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme since January 2010 starting with the most recent changes introduced in Budget 2013:<\/p><p><i>Budget 2013<\/i><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  Electricity allowance restructured and now based on the average best rate (minus the PSO) available for 150 units per month from Electric Ireland, Bord Gais Eireann and Airtricity. The new rate for both the electricity and gas allowances is &euro;35 per month. The change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &euro;37.6 million in a full year.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  Telephone allowance reduced from &euro;22.50 to &euro;9.50 per month. This change is effective from January 2013 and will generate savings of approximately &euro;61 million in a full year.<\/div><\/p><p><i>Budget 2012 <\/i><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  New applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, who are not living with the person for whom they are providing care, are not be entitled to household benefits. The person receiving care may be entitled to household benefits in their own right.  This change was effective from April 2012.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  Duration of the fuel season reduced by six weeks, from 32 to 26 weeks for fuel allowance recipients.<\/div><\/p><p><i>Budget 2011<\/i><\/p><p>Changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel allowance scheme during 2011. These changes were provided for in Budget 2011 but not specified at the time.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  The telephone allowance was reduced to &euro;22.22 per month (from &euro;25.91 per month). However customers would continue to receive &euro;26.86 of value on their bills, at a cost to the State of &euro;22.22 per month. This change was effective from September 2011.<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">-  The smokeless allowance (additional &euro;3.90 per week) payable to some recipients was abolished and one standardised fuel allowance (&euro;20 per week) was available for all qualifying customers. This change was effective from September 2011.<\/div><\/p><p><i>Budget 2010<\/i><\/p><p>There were no changes to the household benefits package or fuel allowance scheme in 2010.<\/p><p>The change to the electricity and gas elements of the household benefits package in Budget 2013 will bring significant savings while aiming to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility.  The cost of the electricity and gas allowances has risen from &euro;110 million in 2005 to an estimated outturn of &euro;201 million in 2012, an increase of 83% over seven years.  In the current economic climate these increases were unsustainable.<\/p><p>The Affordable Energy Strategy drew attention to the fact that customers in receipt of household benefits were much less likely than other customers to switch energy supplier to obtain better value. Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  There will also be some administrative efficiency through simplification of the scheme with one payment rate instead of five.<\/p><p>The change to the telephone allowance is a cost saving measure. The numbers in receipt of the telephone allowance has also increased significantly in recent years, while the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals available, for example, it is possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &euro;19.99 in large retailers.<\/p><p>The smokeless fuel allowance of &euro;3.90 per week was abolished from September 2011. This allowance was first introduced to lessen opposition to a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal and to compensate people in receipt of fuel allowance who were living in coal ban areas for the anticipated higher cost of smokeless fuel.  The ban applied in sixteen towns and cities around the country (Dublin from 1990, Cork 1995, Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford 1998, Celbridge, Galway, Leixlip, Naas and Waterford 2000, Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee 2003).<\/p><p>The rationale for paying this allowance to customers in smokeless areas could not be maintained as the price differential between smoky and smokeless coal has dropped considerably over the years and is now as low as 2%, significantly less than the 20% supplement which the smokeless allowance represented.  Smokeless fuel is also much more energy efficient than conventional coal, more than offsetting any increase in cost. Research indicates that the efficiency gain can be up to 50%.  People were being compensated unnecessarily. Therefore, the smokeless allowance was abolished with a standardised fuel allowance &euro;20 per week for all recipients.<\/p><p>In 2005 there were 265,000 customers in receipt of Fuel Allowance; in 2011 there were 390,000, an increase of almost 50% over six years.  Of these, 147,000 recipients (38%) qualified for the additional smokeless allowance at a cost of &euro;18.7 million for 32 weeks.<\/p><p>The fuel allowance scheme was envisaged as a way of providing some additional support for those on long-term welfare payments during the winter season. Budget 2012 reduced the duration of the fuel allowance by 6 weeks from 32 weeks to 26. However, in paying the allowance for 26 weeks my Department is still providing a fuel support for half of the year and is covering the coldest months of the year from October to April.<\/p><p>The tables below outline the impact of the changes to the household benefits scheme and fuel allowance at an individual level.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Impact of Budget Changes 2011 &ndash; 2013 &ndash; Household Benefits Package<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Electricity Allowance<\/th><th>Gas Allowance<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>From 1 September 2011 &#8211; allowance on bills adjusted from 400 units every two months to 300 units every two months.

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7 March 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  The proposed approach to the development of the National Plan is available on my Department&#8217;s website at   . The Plan will provide for the long-term protection of Ireland&#8217;s raised bog SACs, will address the needs of turf-cutters and can unlock the flexibility available for dealing with the most difficult of bogs, within the terms of the Habitats Directive. <\/p><p><br \/>  Following a request for tenders, my Department is currently assessing proposals from prospective teams of consultants who will undertake the necessary scientific work to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs.  Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected land-owners as part of this process. <\/p><p><br \/>  The detailed exploration of relocation sites is a key element in progressing the National Plan. In collaboration with the Peatlands Council, and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is actively engaging with turf cutting communities to consider how relocation can be progressed. <\/p><p><br \/>  Some 766 applicants for compensation to my Department have indicated an interest in relocation.  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been finalised, or are close to finalisation, for groups from 4 raised bog SACs. Out of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 31 SACs and work is ongoing on investigating these sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 15 raised bog SACs due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites. Options for the remaining sites are also being investigated.<\/p><p><br \/>  If, following an in-depth examination, there are a small number of SACs where there are genuinely no alternatives in terms of relocation, the National Plan may be able to provide some flexibility in this regard.  I hope that the Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. The engagement and agreement of turf-cutting communities to its proposed approaches will be essential to meeting this timeline and to unlocking the potential flexibility it offers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Officials of my Department have been in continuous contact with the organisation referred to by the Deputy over the past year and have met with members of the organisation on several occasions.

The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.<\/p><p>  The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters, which are established in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound &amp; Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted.<\/p><p>  Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content.<\/p><p>  It is also important, of course, that any changes to the system of funding should take account of the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and services and the pervasiveness of such content in today&rsquo;s society. <\/p><p>  Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices (radio, television, smart phone, pc, laptop and many other devices) and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.  That said, I would like to make clear at this point that, while the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a &ldquo;content licence system&rdquo;, the charge will not relate to the amount or type of content accessed by any one individual: it will be a charge that will be applied across all eligible households and businesses, the proceeds of which will be used to fund public service broadcasting and content.<\/p><p>  The replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and much of the detail has yet to be worked out.<\/p><p>  This includes identifying the most appropriate method for collecting the charge and the manner in which issues such as exemptions and enforcement should be dealt with. In this regard, my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money Policy Review conducted by an independently chaired group on the proposed policy.  I would expect to receive a copy of the group&rsquo;s recommendations and report for my consideration by the end of quarter 1 2013.<\/p><p>  At this point, however, I can state that it is my intention that the charge, which will be device independent, will replace the current licence fee and all households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those that are specifically exempted.<\/p><p>  In regard to the issue of exemptions under any new system, this will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRR04200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRR04250"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":531,"qnumall":"[5240\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRR04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if correspondence (details supplied) in relation to the national broadband scheme is an example of an isolated incident or if it is common place; if he will engage with the provider in question and Comreg to ascertain if the provider's obligations are being met and if not, the reason for same; the action that will be taken to address the situation and when it will be taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>The broadband service contracted under National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme.

The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.<\/p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are matters to be addressed in the coming year, and ahead of signing a potential Inter-Governmental Agreement, which would have to ensure no financial cost or risk to the Irish State or consumer.<\/p><p>  Since taking up my position as Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, I have been meeting with companies and individuals involved in the development of renewable energy on an on-going basis.

In terms of our negotiations with the UK, we have not yet determined or agreed the selection process for potential joint projects, which will be a further matter to be discussed and negotiated in the coming year.  Any such selection process will, of course, be open and transparent.  Any new wind turbines that may be built will be subject to the Planning Acts, including the requirements for public consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":1091,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[5932\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the percentage of Irish domestic users receive their electricity from wind farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1092,"content":"<p><b><\/b><font color=\"#212100\">The integration of wind generation in Ireland has increased steadily in recent years.

This was part of a climate and energy package, aimed at responding to the detrimental effects of climate change as well as improving energy sustainability and security.  Following on from this, a series of Directives were negotiated, including a specific Renewable Energy Directive, which assigned individual legally binding targets to each Member State in order that the EU target for 20% renewable energy in consumption by 2020 could be attained.  All member states in the EU agreed that in order to improve energy security of supply and to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, in addition to reducing greenhouse gases in energy production, it was necessary to make a significant shift towards renewable energy.<\/p><p>  Under the Directive, Ireland is required to increase renewable energy from 3.1% in 2005 to 16% in 2020, with a minimum target of 10% in the transport sector.  Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  At end 2012, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources.  Our intention is to reach our overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding target.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.

My Department continues to be responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas in society.\u00a0 The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and is delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies (LDCs). Some &euro;49 million will be invested in our communities through the Programme in 2013.  LDCs promote and actively pursue social inclusion policies, through which all people within a community can be supported and encouraged to participate in the life of their community.  Sustainable social, economic and cultural development for all members of the community is more likely to be achieved by fostering social inclusion and equality.<\/p><p>  The focus of the work of the LDCs is on marginalised groups and\/or disadvantaged areas, groups and individuals who live in geographical communities, or communities of interest, experiencing high levels of poverty and social exclusion.  The LCDP identifies Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People (LGBT) as a group experiencing inequality and discrimination, and recognises that where this combines with other factors it can result in multiple disadvantage and social exclusion.  While the LCDP is not specifically aimed at this group, the Programme works to achieve full equality and inclusion for LGBT in Ireland, and protection from all forms of discrimination.  In 2009, the Local and Community Development Division collaborated, in conjunction with the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN), the Family Support Agency and Pobal, on the development of a Code of Practice for Community Development Projects, Family Resource Centres and Urban Partnership\/Integrated Companies supporting LGBT Communities.  Funding was also provided towards the launch and publication of the Code of Practice.  This Code of Practice went a long way towards promoting awareness and understanding of LGBT through the LCDP and other social inclusion programmes.\u00a0 Furthermore, as examples of assistance provided under the LCDP:<\/p><p>- County Kildare Leader Partnership supported the establishment of a LGBT Group in Kildare, and the opening of a drop-in service;<\/p><p>- An inter-agency action supports the delivery of an LGBT Youth Drop-in Project located in Wexford and Gorey - this is a long-term preventative action, aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of homophobic bullying in post-primary schools thereby reducing early school leaving and\/or poor educational attainment; and the<\/p><p>- Galway Rural Development Company was involved in research with GLEN which identified the need for supports for LGBT groups in County Galway.

In its management of capital programmes, my Department deals with applications for recoupment of expenditure as they are received from local authorities and other bodies, and makes the associated payments as they arise in the course of the year.  Capital expenditure on the relevant progammes has, however, tended to be incurred more towards the end of the year; this has been associated with, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the timing of the completion of work by contractors and of the certification of that work; use of annual planning processes in respect of some programmes; the timing of submission of applications for recoupment to the Department; and the need to address any issues arising on applications before payment is made.  In addition, adverse weather conditions in any year can delay progress and subsequent payment applications on many projects, particularly where groundworks and external finishing works are concerned.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. <\/p><p>  I am aware of the Small Business Rate Relief Scheme in Northern Ireland. Within this jurisdiction, the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes. Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as nister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a temporary levy on large out of town retail operations.  In terms of planning policy, I published new Development Contribution Guidelines on 21 January 2012.  The new guidelines build on the experience gained in recent years and also align development contribution policy with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of employment creation, investment and sustainable development.

The Environmental Protection Agency, in its Code of Practice: Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses, advises that regular de-sludging of a septic tank is required to ensure that the system continues to operate effectively.   <\/p><p><br \/>  On 19 December 2012, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgment against Ireland in the Case C-374\/11 which imposed a lump sum fine of &#8364;2 million and daily fines of &#8364;12,000 for failure to comply with the ECJ judgment C-188\/08 in which the Court found that Ireland had failed to transpose into domestic legislation the requirements of the Waste Directive regarding the disposal of domestic waste water from septic tanks and other individual treatment systems.  The European Commission has yet to write formally to the Irish authorities regarding the fines imposed by the ECJ and so there has been no payment or settlement of these fines yet.\u00a0  It is understood that formal letters will issue from the Commission shortly.  My Department is liaising closely with the Commission on these matters.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The EPA, in its report Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009, has identified on-site waste water treatment systems as one of a number of potential sources of micro-biological contamination of groundwater sources.  The EPA recommends that vulnerable groundwater sources may require special protection measures and that the design and location of abstractions wells is essential to protect against organic inputs.     <\/p><p><br \/>  The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public wastewater infrastructure is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i><\/i>2010-2013<i>. <\/i> The programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;1 billion in relation to wastewater infrastructure. <\/p><p><br \/>  The EPA is responsible for carrying out Ireland&#8217;s national groundwater monitoring programme which consists of a network of some 350 monitoring points.\u00a0  The network has been designed to be representative of the variations in hydrogeology and anthropogenic pressures across a groundwater body and is subject to ongoing review as circumstances change.  Threshold values for mandatory substances under the Priority and Dangerous Substances Directives have been established in the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 and they apply to all groundwater bodies nationally.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the above, the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010 contain provisions aimed at protecting ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.\u00a0  Such measures include a limit on the level of livestock manure which may be applied to land each year, the capacity levels of storage vessels necessary for livestock manure and periods when the land application of certain types of fertiliser is prohibited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme Issues","counter":1228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRU01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1229,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[5799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRU02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 72 and 718 of 16 January 2013 in relation to the proposed Pyrite Resolution Board, if he will confirm that in the event that an estate known to have heave-inducing levels of pyrite in the underfloor fill, where a house which in the opinion of a chartered engineer, has physical damage associated with proven heave-inducing levels of pyrite, that this house will be remediated, if the initial ten year Homebond structural guarantee has lapsed.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1230,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[5800\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 718 of 16 January 2013, if he will explain what is meant by Homebond will provide indirect funding for the remediation process by making technical and administrative services available at lower than market cost, in particular what is meant by market cost.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1231,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 593 and 594   together.   <\/p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board will, in conjunction with my Department, draw up the terms and conditions for a pyrite remediation scheme, including the eligibility criteria that will be applied.

This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation. <\/p><p><br \/>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage.  For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &#8211; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission.  Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road.  Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. <\/p><p><br \/>  The site notice must contain the date on which the notice is erected, state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the five weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application.  The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b><\/b>two weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application.  Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose.  Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on their approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The bulk of the reduction has been applied to the main local authority capital programme which has come down from &#8364;1.029 billion in 2008 to a total of &#8364;115 million in 2012.  Clearly, the financial parameters in which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.  Accordingly, the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Delivery of social housing will be facilitated primarily through more flexible funding models.  The social housing leasing initiative and, in particular, the Rental Accommodation Scheme will each play their part as long term social housing supports.  The Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease, and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A three year programme of new local authority construction starts, covering the 2012- 14 period, is in train.  While there will be limited funding for this initiative, the intention will be to maximise the outputs that can be achieved from what will be a targeted programme. <\/p><p><br \/>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.\u00a0  However, it is provisionally estimated that in excess of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.  This will include:<\/p><p>-350 units for people with special housing needs;<\/p><p>-150 units specifically for people leaving institutional care;<\/p><p>-an additional 400 permanent homes delivered through capital expenditure under the Social Housing Investment Programme;<\/p><p>-300 transfers under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme;<\/p><p>-some 4,000 units will be delivered under social leasing, including property transfers from NAMA, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and mortgage to lease.   <\/p><p>Final details regarding the level of funding which can be allocated to these projects during the year will be determined as part of the Estimates process.

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i> 2010-2013.<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure.  This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services, undertaken by each water services authority, which were subsequently appraised by my Department.  In preparing their assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.  The development of the Programme was strongly influenced by reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality, and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs.  There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.<\/p><p><br \/>  The series of reforms being advanced in the water sector by the Government is designed to support additional investment in the sector.  An implementation strategy is now in place to deliver on these reforms.  This strategy is available on the Department&#8217;s website.  As part of this strategy, a specific work-stream is considering the matters arising in the proposed transfer of the responsibility for capital programme delivery from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water.

There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions; an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated and two new Taxing-Masters have already been appointed in anticipation of this reform.  Determinations of costs made by the Adjudicator will be made public and the Adjudicator may also publish legal costs guidelines.  Separately, the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles.  It also imposes greater obligations on legal practitioners to disclose the actual or potential costs of legal proceedings to their clients; a framework for Alternative Business Models.  The Bill facilitates new forms of legal services provision that take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business technology.  These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be optional alongside current forms of practise and their availability will address a growing competitive disadvantage for our legal services sector.<\/p><p>    In relation to the specific point raised by the Deputy about a single legal profession, Section 30 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides for a report and recommendations to be prepared by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, within two years of its establishment, on whether the professions of barrister and solicitor in the State should be unified.  That Section of the Bill sets out, in some detail, how the relevant recommendations should be made having regard, among other things, to the public interest, the need for competition, the interest of consumers, the proper administration of justice and other matters as may be considered appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Council Legislation","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[5214\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is currently preparing legislation for the introduction of a Judicial Council; the timetable for the introduction of the Judicial Council legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1324,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government undertakes to &#8220;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges<\/i>&#8221; and this commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.<\/p><p><br \/>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012.  These observations were duly considered at my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy.  Following this consideration, I conveyed the relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  Work on the drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and I very much appreciate the ongoing support being given to this initiative by the Chief Justice and her judicial colleagues.  Under the Government's Legislation Programme for the Spring Session, announced by the Chief Whip on 15<sup>th<\/sup> January 2013, publication of the Bill is expected later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1326,"qnumday":631,"qnumall":"[5215\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRV04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on the status of the Coroner's Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1327,"content":"<p>The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.

The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State.<\/p><p>  The key elements of the Bill include: enhancing inquiry and inquest processes; establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters; providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service; moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners; statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process; clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.<\/p><p>  It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill this year.

The Commission prioritises funding for activities that provide direct supports to victims of crime.  A substantial amount of the funding it provides is awarded to voluntary sector groups who provide an accompaniment service to victims of crime when attending court.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Commission advertises its funding scheme each year.  It invites applications from registered charities, voluntary\/community groups and other bodies.  Applicants must be either a registered charity and\/or a limited company.  The Commission&#8217;s funding Scheme for 2013 was advertised on the 5<sup>th<\/sup> October, 2012.  The closing date for receipt of applications was the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>   November, 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There are no minimum or maximum limits on the amounts an applicant can apply for.  However, as every effort is made by the Commission to provide funding to services throughout the country, the full amount sought by a service may not always be granted.<\/p><p><b><\/b><b><i>Cosc<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, operates a grant scheme which provides funding to support groups at local, regional and national level for awareness raising campaigns that increase understanding and recognition of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and provide information of the services available to victims.  Cosc strives to support the improvement of awareness raising through the implementation of a clear communications strategy and through transparent and fair funding procedures.<\/p><p><br \/>  As in previous years, it is anticipated that this year&#8217;s grant scheme will be initiated in mid-to-late March with a public announcement and call for applications via national press media as well as notification on the Cosc website (www.cosc.ie) and E-zine.  The closing date for the receipt of applications is normally 5 weeks later, i.e. mid-to-late April. <\/p><p><br \/>  There is no minimum or maximum limit on the amount an applicant group may apply for.  However, as Cosc makes every effort to provide funding to services in all regions of the country, the full amount sought by a service may not always be granted.  Cosc supports collaboration between groups in raising awareness as an effective and cost saving tool of communication in that it gives groups an opportunity to reach a wider target audience to reinforce a common message.  All successful grant recipients are subject to audit by Cosc and may also be audited by the Internal Audit Unit of my Department.  <\/p><p><b><i>Equality for Women Measure (EWM) 2008 - 2013<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Equality for Women Measure (EWM) 2008-2013 is a positive action measure to promote equality of opportunity for women, supported by the European Social Fund, making funding available to community based not for profit organisations to provide developmental training to enhance labour market opportunities for disadvantaged women.  The Measure is not currently open to receive applications.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p><b><\/b><b><i>Equality Mainstreaming<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Equality Authority does not operate a specific funding programme for community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  The Equality Mainstreaming Unit (EMU) programme, operated by the Equality Authority, is part-funded by the European Social Fund 2007-2013.  As part of its work programme, the EMU periodically funds projects to promote equality mainstreaming in the labour market and by further and vocational education providers.  In such instances, calls for proposals are issued which set out the terms of the particular initiative, including the opening and closing dates and amount of funding available.  Projects for funding are selected on a competitive basis.  Depending on the initiative, calls for proposals may be open to applications from community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  No calls for proposals are currently issued.<\/p><p><b><\/b><b><i>Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration within my Department is responsible for the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.  The first-mentioned of these Funds provides grants for reception measures for refugees and asylum seekers and integration measures for refugees.  The European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals assists with integration actions in respect of persons who are not among the target groups of the Refugee Fund.  Currently, the contribution of the Funds to supported projects is 50% of the total cost and this may be increased to 75 % for projects addressing specific priorities identified in the strategic guidelines drawn up by the European Commission.  These co-financing rates are to increase by 20 percentage points for States, such as Ireland, which are in a rescue package, under a proposal currently before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  The national matching funding has to be sourced by the promoters of the project.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Two calls for applications under these Funds have taken place since their inception, which was 2008 in the case of the Refugee Fund and 2007 in the case of the Integration Fund.  Projects selected under the more recent call commenced in the second half of 2010.  This call specified a minimum grant of &#8364;70,000 and a maximum of &#8364;300,000 and projects could range in duration from 18 months to three years.  As projects selected are now coming to an end or have already ended, consideration is being given to conducting a further call for applications.  The conditions to be specified in such a call would not necessarily be the same as previously, particularly in regard to duration because the proposed EU Asylum and Migration Fund is due to replace the existing Funds from 2014 although the eligibility periods of the new Fund and the existing Funds will overlap for a period.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has also made grants available to national organisations, including national sporting bodies, for the promotion of migrant integration.  This funding is continuing but on a limited scale because their resources are reduced in line with public expenditure generally.

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p><br \/>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom. Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23 December, 2010, to &quot;take back&quot; the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the &quot;take back&quot; request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p><br \/>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.

In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him.  Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time.  The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15 June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request.  As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status.

For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.  <\/p><p>In 2011 a new  Food Information for the Consumer Regulation (1169\/2011\/ EC) provided a framework for extending  explicit compulsory  origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission. The Department of Health (DOH) is the lead department on labelling, but, my Department  has played  an important role in ensuring that Ireland was a strong proponent of extending compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under current rules the origin of processed products which undergo a &quot;substantial transformation&quot; may be regarded as the country in which that processing activity took place. <\/p><p>The Food Information for the Consumer Regulation also provides a framework for adopting  rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as that of its primary ingredient.  The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment, and  detailed rules are to be adopted in implementing acts by the end of this year. It is intended that the legislation will come into effect<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  in 2014. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the free movement of goods within the European Union provides that once goods (including meat) are produced in approved establishments in a Member State, which are  under the supervision of authorities in that  Member State, those goods are free to move within the Union without further official checks at borders within the Union. It would of course be entirely inconsistent with Single Market rules for a State to oblige processors to obtain raw materials from  particular member states, and the application of such strictures to processors in other member states could potentially  have an extremely detrimental effect on the agri-food industry in Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  The principle underpinning the Single Market, which is a critical success factor for the agri food and other sectors in an export oriented economy like Ireland&#8217;s,  is that horizontal public health and hygiene standards apply across the European Union  and that each member state is responsible for ensuring that approved food premises within its jurisdiction comply with the relevant EU regulations.  This system operates on the basis of a common application of the rules by veterinary authorities across the European Union, and is overseen by the Irish based European Food and Veterinary Office, which also conducts audits and inspections to ensure that the system is functioning correctly. <\/p><p><br \/>  On the other hand, meat products imported from outside the EU must come from plants approved under the European Union veterinary inspection regime and having equivalent standards as that within the EU. Meat products entering the EU from a third country are subject to documentary, identity and (if considered necessary) physical checks to ensure compliance with the requirements. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department&#8217;s Veterinary Inspectors conduct audits on approved premises in Ireland. Audits on imported meat include physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and traceability checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. The Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these visits is determined by an annual risk assessment which is conducted for each plant. Checks are also conducted at retail level by the HSE, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRZ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRZ03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1542,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[5268\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRZ04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of his Department&rsquo;s &euro;187 million capital spending for 2013 that will go towards construction projects; the projects involved; the details of these projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1543,"content":"<p>A substantial proportion of the Department&rsquo;s capital budget relates covers the payment of capital grants under various demand led schemes on projects which include construction work undertaken by individuals or corporate entities in the agriculture, forestry, fishery and food processing sectors.

The Rates and Charges Order of 2012 is the legal instrument that provides for parking charges in the Fishery Harbour Centres, and that order provides for maximum charges. The specific elements of any possible scheme that might be introduced are currently being worked on and I will be deciding in due course on the matter, including the detail of how any scheme would apply, and the amount of charges for parking.  <\/p><p>  In order to improve traffic management, enabling works and upgrading works to the car parks within the Fishery Harbour, including lining of parking spaces, have been taking place over a number of months.<\/p><p>  Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour.  It has a number of business customers, including business tenants, vessel owners and crew, etc and, full access is required for commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and the various ancillary enterprises, with appropriate parking arrangements.  It is acknowledged that there are, and have always been, a wide range of recreational users of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre also, including the yacht club, walkers, sightseers and other social users.  A significant number of parking spaces in Howth Fishery Harbour are currently being taken up by commuters using the DART service during the working week.  <\/p><p>  Traffic and parking management within the Fishery Harbour Centre itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The introduction of pay parking is one (and only one) of a number of measures being introduced to address those concerns.<\/p><p>  The introduction of parking charges at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in great detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  There was widespread public consultation at that time but that project did not subsequently proceed.  The outcomes of that public consultation as well as more recent correspondence from a wide range of harbour users, contact between my officials and harbour business tenants and general concerns about the possible effect that the introduction of pay parking might have will be taken into account in arriving at a final pay parking scheme at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.<\/p><p>  Fishery Harbour Centres are financed from the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund.  All income generated in the Fishery Harbours is lodged to this ring-fenced Fund, and it is the only funding available for the operation and management of the Fishery Harbours, of which Howth is one of 6 in the State.  <\/p><p>  Any additional revenue that is generated from pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible given the current financial constraints.  This will, if anything, help to attract inward investments into the Fishery Harbour Centres, and ultimately provide more employment opportunities, not less.  <\/p><p>  Fingal Council has also been consulted about the current plans and in relation to issues of traffic management at both formal and informal meetings with my officials over the past year.<\/p><p>  There are approx 500 parking spaces in the Fishery Harbour Centre at present.  These spaces, although only recently lined and marked, have been in place for a considerable number of years and so it is not considered that a formal planning application should be required.  However, in November 2012, my Department wrote to Fingal Council in order to establish whether or not planning permission is required for the installation of pay and display machines, and a reply is awaited.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the deputies that the new parking arrangements will be designed as far as possible to be fair to all users, while ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of the cost of upkeep of the facility.  <\/p><p>  Pay parking was introduced into the Fishery Harbour Centre in Ros an Mh&iacute;l in June 2012, pay parking has been in operation at Dingle since before it was designated as a Fishery Harbour Centre in 2007 and there are currently no plans to introduce pay parking at the other fishery Harbour Centres (Castletownbere, Killybegs, and Dunmore East).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1570,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[5376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRAA01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details of all funding programmes in his Department that community, voluntary and sporting organisations may apply to for funding; if he will provide a brief overview of each programme; the opening and closing dates of each programme; the minimum and maximum amounts of funding that may be applied for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1571,"content":"<p>   Since 1995, my Department has made ex-gratia payments to a number of organisations directly involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement. This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit on the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>  It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. <\/p><p><br \/>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p><br \/>  DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes.

As the Deputy may be aware, EU Heads of State and Government tried unsuccessfully at the European Council last November to agree the MFF, and a further attempt will be made later this week. From an Irish perspective, the CAP remains our over-riding financial priority. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of direct payments and rural development funding. <\/p><p>  The priority issues supplied by the Deputy relate more particularly to the reform of the CAP for the period post-2013. As President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an interinstitutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. Bearing this in mind, the position is broadly as follows:<\/p><p>  Two of the most difficult issues in the negotiations arise in relation to the administration of the single farm payment. These are internal convergence and greening. As regards internal convergence, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to move to a system of flat-rate national or regional payments would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers. These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact and this is an issue on which Ireland too played a leading role. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while still others are happy with the flat rate system. I hope to be able to navigate a course through these diverging positions in the coming weeks and settle on a compromise acceptable to all Member States. <\/p><p>  As regards greening, all Member States (including Ireland), support further greening of the CAP, as it is consistent with the need to develop the agriculture sector in a sustainable manner. However, there are concerns about the separate and distinct nature of the greening payment, and the fact that it is to be paid on a flat-rate basis. Member States also have issues with the three greening criteria (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas) and favour flexibility to implement these in a simpler manner that is also more relevant to local conditions. Again, I hope to bring forward proposals on these issues in the coming weeks that will strike a balance between the different approaches favoured by Member States.<\/p><p>  On the other direct payments issues raised by the Deputy, the main point outstanding, according to the Cyprus Presidency&rsquo;s Progress Report, is the question of the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, and whether it will be voluntary or mandatory for Member States. I have stated my preference for a mandatory scheme, but can live with a voluntary scheme in the interests of securing agreement with my colleagues around the Council table. I would also like to see eligibility criteria applied in order to avoid potential abuse.<\/p><p>  On rural development, apart from the question of funding, the main issues in the context of the CAP reform package are the effect of the greening of direct payments on the baseline for rural development payments, the delimitation of areas with natural constraints and the structure of risk management and income stabilisation tools. In addition, the Commission is pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives are consistent with EU 2020 strategy priorities, which raises administrative difficulties for Member States. Some of these issues will again prove difficult to resolve, but I hope to make rapid progress over the coming weeks, <\/p><p>  As regards the common organisation of the market, I agree that adequate funding is an important prerequisite for the effective functioning of the various elements of the safety net mechanism. Particularly difficult issues in this dossier will be control measures in the form of sugar quotas and vine planting rights. Member States are pretty evenly divided on the question of whether sugar quotas should be abolished or extended, although the European Parliament generally favours extension. On vine planting rights, the report of the High Level Group will inform the next phase of the discussions, but again the question will be whether to extend the regime or allow the planned expiry in 2015 to proceed. Compensation for reduced milk supply, as proposed by the European Parliament, will also be a difficult issue as it too touches on the organisation of the market, on which there are contrasting views. On producer organisations, some progress has been achieved, with the Special Agriculture Committee this week reaching agreement on the issue of recognition. On exceptional measures and the crisis reserve, the key requirement is that funding is available to deal with whatever emergency situations might arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRBB02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":1662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRBB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[5257\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1477 of 18 September 2012, if capital funding will be made available from her Department for 2013 to fund a maintenance programme for childcare facilities, the aim of which is to provide support to childcare settings to address medial, maintenance and renovation work or to purchase equipment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1664,"content":"<p>In Budget 2012 the Government provided &euro;6 million for remedial, maintenance, and renovation work in established childcare facilities and to assist these facilities to purchase equipment for early education and childcare services.

There will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer and the Health Service Executive must prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope.     <\/p><p>  I requested that the HSE accelerate the projects in both Wexford and in Kilkenny and for very good reasons.  At Wexford General Hospital the admissions lounge is in a portakabin-style building, as is the medical assessment unit at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.<\/p><p>  The new Wexford project comprises an emergency department, a maternity delivery suite and theatre and the necessary equipping.  A main entrance \/ new concourse will also be provided.   The project is under construction and is making good progress.  It is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.<\/p><p>  The new Kilkenny project comprises an emergency department, a medical assessment unit and a day services unit including endoscopy. Construction commenced in 2012 and the project is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.<\/p><p>  Both projects were approved for inclusion in the HSE capital programme in 2008 and have been included in all of the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual Capital Plans since then. <\/p><p>  My decisions fully supported the Government priority which is to improve conditions for patients and reduce overcrowding in Emergency Departments through the delivery of improved accommodation including medical assessment units.  <\/p><p>  As you will be aware, one of the concerns over many years has been capacity issues in the Emergency Departments. Since 2006 capital funding has been made available for an A&amp;E Initiative to provide a series of admission lounges and medical assessment units in order to relieve pressure on A&amp;E departments.   Continuing to address these capacity issues has always been a fundamental aspect of HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plans. The 2008 Capital Plan contained funding to complete developments underway, deliver new A&amp;Es and to upgrade and extend existing departments.   The Wexford and Kilkenny projects were part of this initiative to address capacity.  <\/p><p>  Following the 2009 Budget and Supplementary Budget the HSE&rsquo;s capital allocation was reduced by about 32%. As a consequence, certain projects were paused or deferred.  Those projects which were in construction or at the equipping stage were completed, whereas those which were at earlier stages of development such as appraisal or design were paused \/ deferred once those stages were completed.  The projects deferred included the Wexford and St Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny projects.<\/p><p>  Both projects had advanced sufficiently by 2011 which enabled me to make my decision to accelerate them. Planning permission was in place and both had undergone the design phase.  No projects were delayed, held or omitted from the capital programme to accommodate these projects.<\/p><p>  I was delighted to receive an additional &euro;12 million from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to expedite the sorely needed facility in Wexford General Hospital.   Given that savings were achieved in the construction area due to reduced costs associated with the economic downturn it was also possible to expedite the St Luke&rsquo;s project.<\/p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the 2011 Capital Plan which included these much needed projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRBB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Authority Investigations","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":759,"qnumall":"[5109\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which his Department was first informed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that positive tests showed the presence of horse meat in beef burgers for human consumption; the actions he initiated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1700,"qnumday":760,"qnumall":"[5110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which his Department was first alerted that positive tests indicated that beef burgers for human consumption were adulterated with horsemeat; the action he took in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1701,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 759 and 760 together.<\/p><p>  On 14th January 2013, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) confirmed to my Department that test results from one beef burger sample taken from Silvercrest Foods was found to contain horsemeat.

The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance.

On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).  <\/p><p>  A key stepping stone to the new system will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. <\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. <\/p><p>  The provision of services at any hospital site will primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.<\/p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of persons with expertise in key competencies such as clinical \/ business \/ legal \/ medical academic \/ patient advocacy, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.  <\/p><p>  In June 2012 I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria to assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. <\/p><p>  Work is nearing completion on the draft report on the wider issue of hospital groups: Prof. John Higgins will submit that report to me in early February, I will then bring it to Cabinet for decision. The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. As such I cannot comment at this time on the final composition of the new Hospital Groups.<\/p><p>  The Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group was established on a pilot basis in January 2012, consisting of University College Hospital, Galway, Merlin Park Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon Hospital.  This was in response to budgetary and service issues in relation to Galway and the movement of services between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospital in line with the principles of the smaller hospitals framework, that service should be delivered as close to a person&rsquo;s home as possible. This is commensurate with the need to ensure quality and safety in service delivery such that more complex work generally needs to be carried out in larger hospitals. <\/p><p>  The Galway \/ Roscommon University Hospital Group has gone some way towards realising the governance arrangement which will be recommended by the Report with the appointment of Mr. Noel Daly as chairperson of the Board in May 2012.  Mr. Daly is former Chief Executive of An Bord Altranais and he has also served in senior management posts in the health services in Ireland and in the UK.   In January 2013 the HSE established an interim Board on an administrative non-statutory basis, pending the establishment of Hospital Trusts to manage public hospitals in line with the Governments programme for reform of the health service. The competencies of the individuals appointed are the key to better management of hospitals and it was on this basis that the Board appointments were made.  The administrative Board will be replaced in due course by a Trust Board on a statutory basis and may be dissolved and reconstituted at any time to facilitate the development of Hospital Trusts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1789,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[5254\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the future of the Sacred Heart Hospital Castlebar, County Mayo; the time-frame expected in attaining these goals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1790,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1791,"content":"<p>Question No. 789 answered with Question No. 779.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1792,"content":"<p>Question No. 790 answered with Question No. 772.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1793,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1794,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[5259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1795,"content":"<p>Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government.

Insurance will be provided under a multi-payer insurance model with no distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; patients. Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. <\/p><p><br \/>  In moving to a system of UHI,  there are  a number of key stepping stones  that are necessary to pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance.

The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish in the near future. <\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, the Deputy has asked about a forum in which  private health insurers may engage in relation to plans on UHI.  Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum. The Forum comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The Forum provides a  platform for identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. In addition, it also gives a voice to insurers in raising issues relating to the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1804,"content":"<p>Question No. 795 answered with Question No. 779.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Funding","counter":1805,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1806,"qnumday":796,"qnumall":"[5305\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total amount of money allocated to St. Foundation, Charleville, County Cork in 2012","asker":"1056","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1807,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1809,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[5320\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Offaly may expect a out patient appointment","asker":"1101","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1810,"content":"<p>Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government.

It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations. Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far, and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres. <\/p><p>  Regarding the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont, these when open will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme. Patients at these units will require 24\/7 care and the staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support the service development. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited and I am informed that this is being prioritised. The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WREE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":1857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WREE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1858,"qnumday":819,"qnumall":"[5441\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WREE02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive has incurred any costs in sending epilepsy patients abroad for treatment; the extent of any such costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1859,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has confirmed that the following figures relate to the number of patients with Epilepsy who have availed of treatment under the provisions of the Treatment Abroad Scheme.

This report is based on a comprehensive consultation process, as well as a significant number of submissions from stakeholders and individual citizens. These recommendations have been considered and endorsed by a Strategic Board composed of representatives with national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.  The report on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trust will be presented formally to me by the Chair of the Strategic Board, Professor John Higgins, in the near future. I will prioritise consideration of that report, which will then be submitted to and presented to Government for decision on the hospital groups composition in light of the recommendations of the Report.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa<\/i>   within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals.

The transitional period in the case of social workers ends on 31 May 2013.<\/p><p>  The Health and Social care Professionals Council is an independent statutory body and is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The Council has set a registration fee of  &euro;295 for existing practitioners and a fee of &euro;100 for new graduates.  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for all registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that these fees represent a new cost to health and social care professionals who have already seen reductions in their incomes.  However, all health regulators must be self-funding by way of annual fee income.  Their operational costs are determined by the complexity and breadth of the statutory functions specified in the relevant legislation. Also, the greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. For example, given the very large registrant base in teaching and nursing, the annual fee charged to registered nurses and teachers amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 clinical biochemists to 5,550 social care workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all twelve professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The Council, together with the registration boards, has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding as soon as possible,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. The State is currently funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.5 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so for the next few years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fees, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>  -\tThe registration fee of &euro;295 paid by existing practitioners with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, who are granted registration during the transitional period, will cover them for the remainder of the transitional period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of the two year period.<\/p><p>  -\tThe Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and to keep costs to a minimum.

These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.   These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Symphysiotomy Report","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRGG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":874,"qnumall":"[6065\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500068#WRGG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 12 of 19 December 2012, when the full and completed Walsh report into the practice of symphysiotomy will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware,  my Department has commissioned an independent research report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are matters to be addressed in the coming year, and ahead of signing a potential Inter-Governmental Agreement, which would have to ensure no financial cost or risk to the Irish State or consumer.<\/p><p>  Since taking up my position as Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, I have been meeting with companies and individuals involved in the development of renewable energy on an on-going basis.

In terms of our negotiations with the UK, we have not yet determined or agreed the selection process for potential joint projects, which will be a further matter to be discussed and negotiated in the coming year.  Any such selection process will, of course, be open and transparent.

This was part of a climate and energy package, aimed at responding to the detrimental effects of climate change as well as improving energy sustainability and security.  Following on from this, a series of Directives were negotiated, including a specific Renewable Energy Directive, which assigned individual legally binding targets to each Member State in order that the EU target for 20% renewable energy in consumption by 2020 could be attained.  All member states in the EU agreed that in order to improve energy security of supply and to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, in addition to reducing greenhouse gases in energy production, it was necessary to make a significant shift towards renewable energy.<\/p><p>  Under the Directive, Ireland is required to increase renewable energy from 3.1% in 2005 to 16% in 2020, with a minimum target of 10% in the transport sector.  Energy is consumed across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  At end 2012, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources.  Our intention is to reach our overall target through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding target.  The NREAP and the First Progress Report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target.

My Department continues to be responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas in society.\u00a0 The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and is delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies (LDCs). Some &euro;49 million will be invested in our communities through the Programme in 2013.  LDCs promote and actively pursue social inclusion policies, through which all people within a community can be supported and encouraged to participate in the life of their community.  Sustainable social, economic and cultural development for all members of the community is more likely to be achieved by fostering social inclusion and equality.<\/p><p>  The focus of the work of the LDCs is on marginalised groups and\/or disadvantaged areas, groups and individuals who live in geographical communities, or communities of interest, experiencing high levels of poverty and social exclusion.  The LCDP identifies Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People (LGBT) as a group experiencing inequality and discrimination, and recognises that where this combines with other factors it can result in multiple disadvantage and social exclusion.  While the LCDP is not specifically aimed at this group, the Programme works to achieve full equality and inclusion for LGBT in Ireland, and protection from all forms of discrimination.  In 2009, the Local and Community Development Division collaborated, in conjunction with the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN), the Family Support Agency and Pobal, on the development of a Code of Practice for Community Development Projects, Family Resource Centres and Urban Partnership\/Integrated Companies supporting LGBT Communities.  Funding was also provided towards the launch and publication of the Code of Practice.  This Code of Practice went a long way towards promoting awareness and understanding of LGBT through the LCDP and other social inclusion programmes.\u00a0 Furthermore, as examples of assistance provided under the LCDP:<\/p><p>- County Kildare Leader Partnership supported the establishment of a LGBT Group in Kildare, and the opening of a drop-in service;<\/p><p>- An inter-agency action supports the delivery of an LGBT Youth Drop-in Project located in Wexford and Gorey - this is a long-term preventative action, aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of homophobic bullying in post-primary schools thereby reducing early school leaving and\/or poor educational attainment; and the<\/p><p>- Galway Rural Development Company was involved in research with GLEN which identified the need for supports for LGBT groups in County Galway.  The company now supports LGBT groups in County Galway through funding programmes that assist in the network and collaboration of various agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500069#WRS02875","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2144,"content":"<p>Question No. 551 answered with Question No. 184<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":2145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500069#WRS02969"},{"type":"question","counter":2146,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[5113\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500069#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of families in Ballymun, Dublin, that are still waiting to be rehoused as part of the regeneration project and the details of when these families will be re-housed.","asker":"1022","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2147,"content":"<p>Currently, only three of the original 36 flat blocks in Ballymun are occupied by City Council tenants.

The funding available to the RDP has increased from &#8364;96m in 2012 to &#8364;105m for 2013.

Implementation and enforcement of the building control system is a matter for the local building control authority. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently engaged in a review of Part B &ndash; Fire Safety of the Building Regulations and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document B which advises how the legal requirements in relation to fire safety can be achieved in practice. The question of the appropriate future regulatory requirements for all buildings, including timber frame buildings, will be addressed as part of this review. Any proposals for change will be subject to a comprehensive public consultation process and a rigorous Regulatory Impact Assessment in due course prior to their being signed into law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500070#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500070#WRT03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2221,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[5635\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500070#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline in tabular form the total cost of all conferences and seminars attended by his Department in 2012; the purpose of each conference\/seminar; the location; the number of delegates that attended from his Department\/agencies or otherwise that were represented; the total cost of each conference\/seminar; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2222,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s expenditure on conferences and seminars is outlined in the tables below for 2012.

The Environmental Protection Agency, in its Code of Practice: Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses, advises that regular de-sludging of a septic tank is required to ensure that the system continues to operate effectively.   <\/p><p><br \/>  On 19 December 2012, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgment against Ireland in the Case C-374\/11 which imposed a lump sum fine of &#8364;2 million and daily fines of &#8364;12,000 for failure to comply with the ECJ judgment C-188\/08 in which the Court found that Ireland had failed to transpose into domestic legislation the requirements of the Waste Directive regarding the disposal of domestic waste water from septic tanks and other individual treatment systems.  The European Commission has yet to write formally to the Irish authorities regarding the fines imposed by the ECJ and so there has been no payment or settlement of these fines yet.\u00a0  It is understood that formal letters will issue from the Commission shortly.  My Department is liaising closely with the Commission on these matters.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The EPA, in its report Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009, has identified on-site waste water treatment systems as one of a number of potential sources of micro-biological contamination of groundwater sources.  The EPA recommends that vulnerable groundwater sources may require special protection measures and that the design and location of abstractions wells is essential to protect against organic inputs.     <\/p><p><br \/>  The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public wastewater infrastructure is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i><\/i>2010-2013<i>. <\/i> The programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;1 billion in relation to wastewater infrastructure. <\/p><p><br \/>  The EPA is responsible for carrying out Ireland&#8217;s national groundwater monitoring programme which consists of a network of some 350 monitoring points.\u00a0  The network has been designed to be representative of the variations in hydrogeology and anthropogenic pressures across a groundwater body and is subject to ongoing review as circumstances change.  Threshold values for mandatory substances under the Priority and Dangerous Substances Directives have been established in the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 and they apply to all groundwater bodies nationally.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the above, the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010 contain provisions aimed at protecting ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.\u00a0  Such measures include a limit on the level of livestock manure which may be applied to land each year, the capacity levels of storage vessels necessary for livestock manure and periods when the land application of certain types of fertiliser is prohibited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme Issues","counter":2261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2262,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[5799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 72 and 718 of 16 January 2013 in relation to the proposed Pyrite Resolution Board, if he will confirm that in the event that an estate known to have heave-inducing levels of pyrite in the underfloor fill, where a house which in the opinion of a chartered engineer, has physical damage associated with proven heave-inducing levels of pyrite, that this house will be remediated, if the initial ten year Homebond structural guarantee has lapsed.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":2263,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[5800\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 718 of 16 January 2013, if he will explain what is meant by Homebond will provide indirect funding for the remediation process by making technical and administrative services available at lower than market cost, in particular what is meant by market cost.","asker":"1015","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2264,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 593 and 594   together.   <\/p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board will, in conjunction with my Department, draw up the terms and conditions for a pyrite remediation scheme, including the eligibility criteria that will be applied.

Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure. <\/p><p><br \/>  The site notice must contain the date on which the notice is erected, state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the five weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application.  The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than<b><\/b>two weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application.  Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose.  Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on their approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Applications for wind energy development over 25 turbines and greater than 50 MW may be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under Section 37A (inserted by Strategic Infrastructure Act) of the 2000 Planning and Development Act, as amended. <\/p><p><br \/>  In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, my Department &#8211; in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders &#8211; is now undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006. <\/p><p><br \/>  This focused review will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise proximity, visual amenity and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate together, and will explore ways of building community support for wind energy development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Mortgages","counter":2276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2277,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[5957\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500071#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of holders of shared ownership mortgages who have been issued with the requirements to present a standard financial statements by the various local authorities a consequence of which may be referral to a credit bureau; if such a procedure is in accord with the function of a local authority as defined under the Housing Acts; if it is intended to make alternative provisions for families who may not be in a position to meet the requirements arising from such review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2278,"content":"<p>In advancing loans for house purchase by lower income borrowers, it is of critical importance that local authorities make such funding available on the basis of sound lending criteria.

The bulk of the reduction has been applied to the main local authority capital programme which has come down from &#8364;1.029 billion in 2008 to a total of &#8364;115 million in 2012.  Clearly, the financial parameters in which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.  Accordingly, the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Delivery of social housing will be facilitated primarily through more flexible funding models.  The social housing leasing initiative and, in particular, the Rental Accommodation Scheme will each play their part as long term social housing supports.  The Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease, and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.   <\/p><p><br \/>  A three year programme of new local authority construction starts, covering the 2012- 14 period, is in train.  While there will be limited funding for this initiative, the intention will be to maximise the outputs that can be achieved from what will be a targeted programme. <\/p><p><br \/>  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.\u00a0  However, it is provisionally estimated that in excess of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.  This will include:<\/p><p>-350 units for people with special housing needs;<\/p><p>-150 units specifically for people leaving institutional care;<\/p><p>-an additional 400 permanent homes delivered through capital expenditure under the Social Housing Investment Programme;<\/p><p>-300 transfers under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme;<\/p><p>-some 4,000 units will be delivered under social leasing, including property transfers from NAMA, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and mortgage to lease.   <\/p><p>Final details regarding the level of funding which can be allocated to these projects during the year will be determined as part of the Estimates process.

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme<i> 2010-2013.<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure.  This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services, undertaken by each water services authority, which were subsequently appraised by my Department.  In preparing their assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas.  The development of the Programme was strongly influenced by reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality, and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.  In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs.  There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.<\/p><p><br \/>  The series of reforms being advanced in the water sector by the Government is designed to support additional investment in the sector.  An implementation strategy is now in place to deliver on these reforms.  This strategy is available on the Department&#8217;s website.  As part of this strategy, a specific work-stream is considering the matters arising in the proposed transfer of the responsibility for capital programme delivery from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water.  This includes the development of the capital investment programme for 2014 to 2015 and the development of a capital transition plan to manage the orderly transition from current arrangements to the new arrangements to be put in place by Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV00550","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Expenditure","counter":2308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV00625"},{"type":"question","counter":2309,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[5970\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total cost of remedial works in respect of illegal or unregulated land fill sites in each of the past five years to date; the likely cost in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2310,"content":"<p>The location of illegal waste activities comprehended by the European Court of Justice judgment in Case C 494\/01 involve sites at Ardristan in County Carlow, Whitestown and Castleruddery in County Wicklow, and the illegal infill of wetlands in County Waterford.  My Department, on behalf of the State, has been liaising with the European Commission to ensure that the requirements of the judgment are fully met.  The Commission is concerned, as I am, to secure the urgent remediation of these sites.<\/p><p>Ministerial policy directions which issued in May 2005 and July 2008 provide guidance on the appropriate course of action to be followed where illegal deposition of waste is discovered.  The policy direction issued in 2005 sets the standard in terms of the expected response from the regulatory authorities, who are obliged to ensure that the necessary remedial measures are taken to ensure that sites are restored and that waste illegally deposited is appropriately disposed of or recovered.  The 2008 direction deals with the use of sanctions to ensure effective actions against those involved in unauthorised waste activities.<\/p><p>In practice, the bulk of the projects aiming to remediate the sites in question did not get underway until 2010.  Consequently, most of the claims to my Department for reimbursement of the costs to the relevant local authority were made from 2011 onwards.

These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs.<\/p><p>  Effect is being given to these structural reform commitments in the form of the extensive provisions of the Legal Services Bill 2011 which was published, in keeping with the relevant time-line under the Troika Programme, in the last Quarter of 2011.  The Bill, which remains a priority under the Government Legislation Programme, completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February 2012 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage - priority also had to be given to the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Bill by the end of last year as a competing Troika Programme objective.  Detailed preparation of the Legal Services Regulation Bill is, therefore, ongoing at my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.  As I have previously indicated, amendments to the Bill will be made available for consideration prior to the commencement of Committee Stage which is anticipated during this Session.  The Bill has four main levers of modernisation and reform, namely, a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers; an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions; an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated and two new Taxing-Masters have already been appointed in anticipation of this reform.  Determinations of costs made by the Adjudicator will be made public and the Adjudicator may also publish legal costs guidelines.  Separately, the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles.  It also imposes greater obligations on legal practitioners to disclose the actual or potential costs of legal proceedings to their clients; a framework for Alternative Business Models.  The Bill facilitates new forms of legal services provision that take account of the emergent new business models in other common law jurisdictions and the huge advances made in business technology.  These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be optional alongside current forms of practise and their availability will address a growing competitive disadvantage for our legal services sector.<\/p><p>    In relation to the specific point raised by the Deputy about a single legal profession, Section 30 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides for a report and recommendations to be prepared by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, within two years of its establishment, on whether the professions of barrister and solicitor in the State should be unified.  That Section of the Bill sets out, in some detail, how the relevant recommendations should be made having regard, among other things, to the public interest, the need for competition, the interest of consumers, the proper administration of justice and other matters as may be considered appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Council Legislation","counter":2355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV03850"},{"type":"question","counter":2356,"qnumday":630,"qnumall":"[5214\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500072#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is currently preparing legislation for the introduction of a Judicial Council; the timetable for the introduction of the Judicial Council legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2357,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government undertakes to &#8220;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges<\/i>&#8221; and this commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.

A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012.

The Commission prioritises funding for activities that provide direct supports to victims of crime.  A substantial amount of the funding it provides is awarded to voluntary sector groups who provide an accompaniment service to victims of crime when attending court.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Commission advertises its funding scheme each year.  It invites applications from registered charities, voluntary\/community groups and other bodies.  Applicants must be either a registered charity and\/or a limited company.  The Commission&#8217;s funding Scheme for 2013 was advertised on the 5<sup>th<\/sup> October, 2012.  The closing date for receipt of applications was the 23<sup>rd<\/sup>   November, 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There are no minimum or maximum limits on the amounts an applicant can apply for.

Cosc strives to support the improvement of awareness raising through the implementation of a clear communications strategy and through transparent and fair funding procedures.<\/p><p><br \/>  As in previous years, it is anticipated that this year&#8217;s grant scheme will be initiated in mid-to-late March with a public announcement and call for applications via national press media as well as notification on the Cosc website (www.cosc.ie) and E-zine.  The closing date for the receipt of applications is normally 5 weeks later, i.e. mid-to-late April. <\/p><p><br \/>  There is no minimum or maximum limit on the amount an applicant group may apply for.  However, as Cosc makes every effort to provide funding to services in all regions of the country, the full amount sought by a service may not always be granted.  Cosc supports collaboration between groups in raising awareness as an effective and cost saving tool of communication in that it gives groups an opportunity to reach a wider target audience to reinforce a common message.

The Measure is not currently open to receive applications.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p><b><\/b><b><i>Equality Mainstreaming<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Equality Authority does not operate a specific funding programme for community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  The Equality Mainstreaming Unit (EMU) programme, operated by the Equality Authority, is part-funded by the European Social Fund 2007-2013.  As part of its work programme, the EMU periodically funds projects to promote equality mainstreaming in the labour market and by further and vocational education providers.  In such instances, calls for proposals are issued which set out the terms of the particular initiative, including the opening and closing dates and amount of funding available.  Projects for funding are selected on a competitive basis.  Depending on the initiative, calls for proposals may be open to applications from community, voluntary and sporting organisations.  No calls for proposals are currently issued.<\/p><p><b><\/b><b><i>Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration within my Department is responsible for the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.  The first-mentioned of these Funds provides grants for reception measures for refugees and asylum seekers and integration measures for refugees.  The European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals assists with integration actions in respect of persons who are not among the target groups of the Refugee Fund.  Currently, the contribution of the Funds to supported projects is 50% of the total cost and this may be increased to 75 % for projects addressing specific priorities identified in the strategic guidelines drawn up by the European Commission.  These co-financing rates are to increase by 20 percentage points for States, such as Ireland, which are in a rescue package, under a proposal currently before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  The national matching funding has to be sourced by the promoters of the project.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Two calls for applications under these Funds have taken place since their inception, which was 2008 in the case of the Refugee Fund and 2007 in the case of the Integration Fund.  Projects selected under the more recent call commenced in the second half of 2010.  This call specified a minimum grant of &#8364;70,000 and a maximum of &#8364;300,000 and projects could range in duration from 18 months to three years.  As projects selected are now coming to an end or have already ended, consideration is being given to conducting a further call for applications.  The conditions to be specified in such a call would not necessarily be the same as previously, particularly in regard to duration because the proposed EU Asylum and Migration Fund is due to replace the existing Funds from 2014 although the eligibility periods of the new Fund and the existing Funds will overlap for a period.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has also made grants available to national organisations, including national sporting bodies, for the promotion of migrant integration.  This funding is continuing but on a limited scale because their resources are reduced in line with public expenditure generally.

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p><br \/>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom. Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23 December, 2010, to &quot;take back&quot; the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the &quot;take back&quot; request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p><br \/>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin.  In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him.  Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time.  The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15 June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request.  As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status.

For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.  <\/p><p>In 2011 a new  Food Information for the Consumer Regulation (1169\/2011\/ EC) provided a framework for extending  explicit compulsory  origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission. The Department of Health (DOH) is the lead department on labelling, but, my Department  has played  an important role in ensuring that Ireland was a strong proponent of extending compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under current rules the origin of processed products which undergo a &quot;substantial transformation&quot; may be regarded as the country in which that processing activity took place. <\/p><p>The Food Information for the Consumer Regulation also provides a framework for adopting  rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as that of its primary ingredient.  The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment, and  detailed rules are to be adopted in implementing acts by the end of this year. It is intended that the legislation will come into effect<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  in 2014. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware,  the free movement of goods within the European Union provides that once goods (including meat) are produced in approved establishments in a Member State, which are  under the supervision of authorities in that  Member State, those goods are free to move within the Union without further official checks at borders within the Union. It would of course be entirely inconsistent with Single Market rules for a State to oblige processors to obtain raw materials from  particular member states, and the application of such strictures to processors in other member states could potentially  have an extremely detrimental effect on the agri-food industry in Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  The principle underpinning the Single Market, which is a critical success factor for the agri food and other sectors in an export oriented economy like Ireland&#8217;s,  is that horizontal public health and hygiene standards apply across the European Union  and that each member state is responsible for ensuring that approved food premises within its jurisdiction comply with the relevant EU regulations.  This system operates on the basis of a common application of the rules by veterinary authorities across the European Union, and is overseen by the Irish based European Food and Veterinary Office, which also conducts audits and inspections to ensure that the system is functioning correctly. <\/p><p><br \/>  On the other hand, meat products imported from outside the EU must come from plants approved under the European Union veterinary inspection regime and having equivalent standards as that within the EU. Meat products entering the EU from a third country are subject to documentary, identity and (if considered necessary) physical checks to ensure compliance with the requirements. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department&#8217;s Veterinary Inspectors conduct audits on approved premises in Ireland. Audits on imported meat include physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and traceability checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. The Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department approved meat plants. The frequency of these visits is determined by an annual risk assessment which is conducted for each plant. Checks are also conducted at retail level by the HSE, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500076#WRZ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":2574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500076#WRZ03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2575,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[5268\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500076#WRZ04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of his Department&rsquo;s &euro;187 million capital spending for 2013 that will go towards construction projects; the projects involved; the details of these projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2576,"content":"<p>A substantial proportion of the Department&rsquo;s capital budget relates covers the payment of capital grants under various demand led schemes on projects which include construction work undertaken by individuals or corporate entities in the agriculture, forestry, fishery and food processing sectors.

The Rates and Charges Order of 2012 is the legal instrument that provides for parking charges in the Fishery Harbour Centres, and that order provides for maximum charges. The specific elements of any possible scheme that might be introduced are currently being worked on and I will be deciding in due course on the matter, including the detail of how any scheme would apply, and the amount of charges for parking.  <\/p><p>  In order to improve traffic management, enabling works and upgrading works to the car parks within the Fishery Harbour, including lining of parking spaces, have been taking place over a number of months.<\/p><p>  Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour.  It has a number of business customers, including business tenants, vessel owners and crew, etc and, full access is required for commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and the various ancillary enterprises, with appropriate parking arrangements.  It is acknowledged that there are, and have always been, a wide range of recreational users of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre also, including the yacht club, walkers, sightseers and other social users.  A significant number of parking spaces in Howth Fishery Harbour are currently being taken up by commuters using the DART service during the working week.  <\/p><p>  Traffic and parking management within the Fishery Harbour Centre itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The introduction of pay parking is one (and only one) of a number of measures being introduced to address those concerns.<\/p><p>  The introduction of parking charges at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in great detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  There was widespread public consultation at that time but that project did not subsequently proceed.  The outcomes of that public consultation as well as more recent correspondence from a wide range of harbour users, contact between my officials and harbour business tenants and general concerns about the possible effect that the introduction of pay parking might have will be taken into account in arriving at a final pay parking scheme at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.<\/p><p>  Fishery Harbour Centres are financed from the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund.  All income generated in the Fishery Harbours is lodged to this ring-fenced Fund, and it is the only funding available for the operation and management of the Fishery Harbours, of which Howth is one of 6 in the State.  <\/p><p>  Any additional revenue that is generated from pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible given the current financial constraints.  This will, if anything, help to attract inward investments into the Fishery Harbour Centres, and ultimately provide more employment opportunities, not less.  <\/p><p>  Fingal Council has also been consulted about the current plans and in relation to issues of traffic management at both formal and informal meetings with my officials over the past year.<\/p><p>  There are approx 500 parking spaces in the Fishery Harbour Centre at present.  These spaces, although only recently lined and marked, have been in place for a considerable number of years and so it is not considered that a formal planning application should be required.  However, in November 2012, my Department wrote to Fingal Council in order to establish whether or not planning permission is required for the installation of pay and display machines, and a reply is awaited.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the deputies that the new parking arrangements will be designed as far as possible to be fair to all users, while ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of the cost of upkeep of the facility.  <\/p><p>  Pay parking was introduced into the Fishery Harbour Centre in Ros an Mh&iacute;l in June 2012, pay parking has been in operation at Dingle since before it was designated as a Fishery Harbour Centre in 2007 and there are currently no plans to introduce pay parking at the other fishery Harbour Centres (Castletownbere, Killybegs, and Dunmore East).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500077#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":2602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500077#WRAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2603,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[5376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500077#WRAA01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details of all funding programmes in his Department that community, voluntary and sporting organisations may apply to for funding; if he will provide a brief overview of each programme; the opening and closing dates of each programme; the minimum and maximum amounts of funding that may be applied for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2604,"content":"<p>   Since 1995, my Department has made ex-gratia payments to a number of organisations directly involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement. This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit on the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>  It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. <\/p><p><br \/>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, some 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852\/2004, 854\/2004 and 2073\/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.<\/p><p><br \/>  DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes.

As the Deputy may be aware, EU Heads of State and Government tried unsuccessfully at the European Council last November to agree the MFF, and a further attempt will be made later this week. From an Irish perspective, the CAP remains our over-riding financial priority. The Government is therefore determined to protect the CAP to the maximum extent possible, and to defend Ireland&rsquo;s share of direct payments and rural development funding. <\/p><p>  The priority issues supplied by the Deputy relate more particularly to the reform of the CAP for the period post-2013. As President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an interinstitutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. Bearing this in mind, the position is broadly as follows:<\/p><p>  Two of the most difficult issues in the negotiations arise in relation to the administration of the single farm payment. These are internal convergence and greening. As regards internal convergence, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to move to a system of flat-rate national or regional payments would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers. These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact and this is an issue on which Ireland too played a leading role. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while still others are happy with the flat rate system. I hope to be able to navigate a course through these diverging positions in the coming weeks and settle on a compromise acceptable to all Member States. <\/p><p>  As regards greening, all Member States (including Ireland), support further greening of the CAP, as it is consistent with the need to develop the agriculture sector in a sustainable manner. However, there are concerns about the separate and distinct nature of the greening payment, and the fact that it is to be paid on a flat-rate basis. Member States also have issues with the three greening criteria (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas) and favour flexibility to implement these in a simpler manner that is also more relevant to local conditions. Again, I hope to bring forward proposals on these issues in the coming weeks that will strike a balance between the different approaches favoured by Member States.<\/p><p>  On the other direct payments issues raised by the Deputy, the main point outstanding, according to the Cyprus Presidency&rsquo;s Progress Report, is the question of the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, and whether it will be voluntary or mandatory for Member States. I have stated my preference for a mandatory scheme, but can live with a voluntary scheme in the interests of securing agreement with my colleagues around the Council table. I would also like to see eligibility criteria applied in order to avoid potential abuse.<\/p><p>  On rural development, apart from the question of funding, the main issues in the context of the CAP reform package are the effect of the greening of direct payments on the baseline for rural development payments, the delimitation of areas with natural constraints and the structure of risk management and income stabilisation tools. In addition, the Commission is pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives are consistent with EU 2020 strategy priorities, which raises administrative difficulties for Member States. Some of these issues will again prove difficult to resolve, but I hope to make rapid progress over the coming weeks, <\/p><p>  As regards the common organisation of the market, I agree that adequate funding is an important prerequisite for the effective functioning of the various elements of the safety net mechanism. Particularly difficult issues in this dossier will be control measures in the form of sugar quotas and vine planting rights. Member States are pretty evenly divided on the question of whether sugar quotas should be abolished or extended, although the European Parliament generally favours extension. On vine planting rights, the report of the High Level Group will inform the next phase of the discussions, but again the question will be whether to extend the regime or allow the planned expiry in 2015 to proceed. Compensation for reduced milk supply, as proposed by the European Parliament, will also be a difficult issue as it too touches on the organisation of the market, on which there are contrasting views. On producer organisations, some progress has been achieved, with the Special Agriculture Committee this week reaching agreement on the issue of recognition. On exceptional measures and the crisis reserve, the key requirement is that funding is available to deal with whatever emergency situations might arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500078#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":2696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500078#WRBB02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":2695,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500078#WRBB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2696,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[5257\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500078#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1477 of 18 September 2012, if capital funding will be made available from her Department for 2013 to fund a maintenance programme for childcare facilities, the aim of which is to provide support to childcare settings to address medial, maintenance and renovation work or to purchase equipment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2697,"content":"<p>In Budget 2012 the Government provided &euro;6 million for remedial, maintenance, and renovation work in established childcare facilities and to assist these facilities to purchase equipment for early education and childcare services.

There will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer and the Health Service Executive must prioritise infrastructure projects within its overall capital envelope.     <\/p><p>  I requested that the HSE accelerate the projects in both Wexford and in Kilkenny and for very good reasons.  At Wexford General Hospital the admissions lounge is in a portakabin-style building, as is the medical assessment unit at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Kilkenny.<\/p><p>  The new Wexford project comprises an emergency department, a maternity delivery suite and theatre and the necessary equipping.  A main entrance \/ new concourse will also be provided.   The project is under construction and is making good progress.  It is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.<\/p><p>  The new Kilkenny project comprises an emergency department, a medical assessment unit and a day services unit including endoscopy. Construction commenced in 2012 and the project is expected to be completed and operational in mid to late 2014.<\/p><p>  Both projects were approved for inclusion in the HSE capital programme in 2008 and have been included in all of the HSE&rsquo;s multi-annual Capital Plans since then. <\/p><p>  My decisions fully supported the Government priority which is to improve conditions for patients and reduce overcrowding in Emergency Departments through the delivery of improved accommodation including medical assessment units.  <\/p><p>  As you will be aware, one of the concerns over many years has been capacity issues in the Emergency Departments. Since 2006 capital funding has been made available for an A&amp;E Initiative to provide a series of admission lounges and medical assessment units in order to relieve pressure on A&amp;E departments.   Continuing to address these capacity issues has always been a fundamental aspect of HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plans. The 2008 Capital Plan contained funding to complete developments underway, deliver new A&amp;Es and to upgrade and extend existing departments.   The Wexford and Kilkenny projects were part of this initiative to address capacity.  <\/p><p>  Following the 2009 Budget and Supplementary Budget the HSE&rsquo;s capital allocation was reduced by about 32%. As a consequence, certain projects were paused or deferred.  Those projects which were in construction or at the equipping stage were completed, whereas those which were at earlier stages of development such as appraisal or design were paused \/ deferred once those stages were completed.  The projects deferred included the Wexford and St Luke&rsquo;s Kilkenny projects.<\/p><p>  Both projects had advanced sufficiently by 2011 which enabled me to make my decision to accelerate them. Planning permission was in place and both had undergone the design phase.  No projects were delayed, held or omitted from the capital programme to accommodate these projects.<\/p><p>  I was delighted to receive an additional &euro;12 million from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to expedite the sorely needed facility in Wexford General Hospital.   Given that savings were achieved in the construction area due to reduced costs associated with the economic downturn it was also possible to expedite the St Luke&rsquo;s project.<\/p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the 2011 Capital Plan which included these much needed projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500078#WRBB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Authority Investigations","counter":2731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500079#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2732,"qnumday":759,"qnumall":"[5109\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500079#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which his Department was first informed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that positive tests showed the presence of horse meat in beef burgers for human consumption; the actions he initiated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2733,"qnumday":760,"qnumall":"[5110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500079#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which his Department was first alerted that positive tests indicated that beef burgers for human consumption were adulterated with horsemeat; the action he took in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2734,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 759 and 760 together.<\/p><p>  On 14th January 2013, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) confirmed to my Department that test results from one beef burger sample taken from Silvercrest Foods was found to contain horsemeat.

The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance.

On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).  <\/p><p>  A key stepping stone to the new system will be to develop independent not-for-profit hospital trusts in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. <\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals. It is about the bringing together groups of hospitals to form single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery. <\/p><p>  The provision of services at any hospital site will primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.<\/p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of persons with expertise in key competencies such as clinical \/ business \/ legal \/ medical academic \/ patient advocacy, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.  <\/p><p>  In June 2012 I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria to assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. <\/p><p>  Work is nearing completion on the draft report on the wider issue of hospital groups: Prof. John Higgins will submit that report to me in early February, I will then bring it to Cabinet for decision. The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. As such I cannot comment at this time on the final composition of the new Hospital Groups.<\/p><p>  The Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group was established on a pilot basis in January 2012, consisting of University College Hospital, Galway, Merlin Park Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon Hospital.  This was in response to budgetary and service issues in relation to Galway and the movement of services between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospital in line with the principles of the smaller hospitals framework, that service should be delivered as close to a person&rsquo;s home as possible. This is commensurate with the need to ensure quality and safety in service delivery such that more complex work generally needs to be carried out in larger hospitals. <\/p><p>  The Galway \/ Roscommon University Hospital Group has gone some way towards realising the governance arrangement which will be recommended by the Report with the appointment of Mr. Noel Daly as chairperson of the Board in May 2012.  Mr. Daly is former Chief Executive of An Bord Altranais and he has also served in senior management posts in the health services in Ireland and in the UK.   In January 2013 the HSE established an interim Board on an administrative non-statutory basis, pending the establishment of Hospital Trusts to manage public hospitals in line with the Governments programme for reform of the health service. The competencies of the individuals appointed are the key to better management of hospitals and it was on this basis that the Board appointments were made.  The administrative Board will be replaced in due course by a Trust Board on a statutory basis and may be dissolved and reconstituted at any time to facilitate the development of Hospital Trusts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2822,"qnumday":788,"qnumall":"[5254\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the future of the Sacred Heart Hospital Castlebar, County Mayo; the time-frame expected in attaining these goals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2823,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2824,"content":"<p>Question No. 789 answered with Question No. 779.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2825,"content":"<p>Question No. 790 answered with Question No. 772.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2826,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2827,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[5259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2828,"content":"<p>Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government.

Insurance will be provided under a multi-payer insurance model with no distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; patients. Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. <\/p><p><br \/>  In moving to a system of UHI,  there are  a number of key stepping stones  that are necessary to pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance.

The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish in the near future. <\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, the Deputy has asked about a forum in which  private health insurers may engage in relation to plans on UHI.  Last year, I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum. The Forum comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The Forum provides a  platform for identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. In addition, it also gives a voice to insurers in raising issues relating to the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2837,"content":"<p>Question No. 795 answered with Question No. 779.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Funding","counter":2838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2839,"qnumday":796,"qnumall":"[5305\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total amount of money allocated to St. Foundation, Charleville, County Cork in 2012","asker":"1056","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2840,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2841,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2842,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[5320\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500080#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Offaly may expect a out patient appointment","asker":"1101","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2843,"content":"<p>Improving access to outpatient services is a key priority for the Government.

It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations. Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far, and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres. <\/p><p>  Regarding the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont, these when open will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme. Patients at these units will require 24\/7 care and the staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support the service development. I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians. Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited and I am informed that this is being prioritised. The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500081#WREE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":2890,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500081#WREE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2891,"qnumday":819,"qnumall":"[5441\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500081#WREE02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive has incurred any costs in sending epilepsy patients abroad for treatment; the extent of any such costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2892,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has confirmed that the following figures relate to the number of patients with Epilepsy who have availed of treatment under the provisions of the Treatment Abroad Scheme.

This report is based on a comprehensive consultation process, as well as a significant number of submissions from stakeholders and individual citizens. These recommendations have been considered and endorsed by a Strategic Board composed of representatives with national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.  The report on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trust will be presented formally to me by the Chair of the Strategic Board, Professor John Higgins, in the near future. I will prioritise consideration of that report, which will then be submitted to and presented to Government for decision on the hospital groups composition in light of the recommendations of the Report.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa<\/i>   within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am determined to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals.

The transitional period in the case of social workers ends on 31 May 2013.<\/p><p>  The Health and Social care Professionals Council is an independent statutory body and is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The Council has set a registration fee of  &euro;295 for existing practitioners and a fee of &euro;100 for new graduates.  An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for all registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that these fees represent a new cost to health and social care professionals who have already seen reductions in their incomes.  However, all health regulators must be self-funding by way of annual fee income.  Their operational costs are determined by the complexity and breadth of the statutory functions specified in the relevant legislation. Also, the greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. For example, given the very large registrant base in teaching and nursing, the annual fee charged to registered nurses and teachers amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 clinical biochemists to 5,550 social care workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all twelve professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The Council, together with the registration boards, has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding as soon as possible,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. The State is currently funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.5 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so for the next few years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fees, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>  -\tThe registration fee of &euro;295 paid by existing practitioners with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, who are granted registration during the transitional period, will cover them for the remainder of the transitional period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of the two year period.<\/p><p>  -\tThe Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and to keep costs to a minimum.

These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.   These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500083#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Symphysiotomy Report","counter":3037,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500083#WRGG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":3038,"qnumday":874,"qnumall":"[6065\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020500083#WRGG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 12 of 19 December 2012, when the full and completed Walsh report into the practice of symphysiotomy will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3039,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware,  my Department has commissioned an independent research report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.
