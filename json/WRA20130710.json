Issues relating to employment rights policy fall within my remit.  Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees legally employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person's home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees and as such, it is my view that no additional regulation is required.  <\/p><p>  It is important to distinguish such domestic employees from an au pair placement.  A genuine au pair placement falls outside the scope of the employer-employee relationship. <\/p><p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees and as such are fully protected by the State's employment rights legislation.

Complaints received by NERA concerning au pairs would first be examined using the &#8220;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&#8221; in order to determine whether or not the person is in fact an employee.

In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time, setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:<\/p><p>  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;<\/p><p>  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies). These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.<\/p><p>  The most recent set of composite figures published are for Quarter 1 2013 and show that 92% of Government payments, valued at &euro;468m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Quarter 1 2013 returns also shows that 91% of Agencies&rsquo; payments, under the remit of my Department and valued at &euro;28.3m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.  The Late Payment Directive which established EU law in the area of prompt payments was originally introduced in 2000 and was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  The Recast Directive (2011\/7\/EU) came into effect across the EU on 16 March 2013.  The issue of prompt payment is now covered in Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).<\/p><p>  This legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms. It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  Minister Perry recently announced agreement for the text of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments aimed at improving cash flow between businesses.  The Code of Conduct is being developed by the Business Representative Bodies in Ireland with the support of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Signatories to the Code will undertake to:<\/p><p>  - Pay suppliers on time, within the terms of contract and in accordance with legislation;<\/p><p>  - Give clear guidance to suppliers on payment procedure; and<\/p><p>  - Encourage good practice by promoting adoption of the Code.<\/p><p>  Prompt payments legislation serves as an important mechanism that can help to improve cashflow for businesses. I believe the publication of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments combined with the recent implementation of the Late Payment Directive and the 15 day prompt payment arrangement for the Public Sector, represents significant progress on the issue of prompt payments in Ireland in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[33502\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way job numbers, job losses and job creation figures correlated with exports over the past ten years.","asker":"969","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>In the period between Quarter 1 2008 and Quarter 1 2012 the economy experienced the loss of 321,000 jobs. Throughout this period, those sectors which rely mainly on trading in the domestic market suffered the greatest job losses. For example, the Construction sector directly accounted for over 150,000 job losses between 2008 and 2012, while 48,000 jobs were lost in the Wholesale and Retail sector.<\/p><p>The sectors which have proved most resilient in maintaining or increasing employment levels during the economic crisis are those which are engaged in exporting goods and services. In examining the relationship between exports and employment, therefore, it is more appropriate to examine exports and employment for companies supported by the enterprise development agencies &ndash; which focus on exports - rather than the economy as a whole.  These companies account for the bulk of Irish exports (80% in 2012) and directly employed 294,000 in 2012.  They are indirectly responsible for a similar number of jobs in ancillary and support services.<\/p><p>Table 1 shows the numbers in employment in companies supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Udaras na Gaeltachta between 2003 and 2012.  The value of exports in these companies over the same period is also provided.  The table shows a reasonable correlation between employment and exports in these companies throughout the period 2003-2012.  When exports performed strongly in the period 2003 to 2007, employment in agency assisted companies grew, with 23,500 jobs added in that period. As exports declined between 2008 and 2009, employment fell sharply. In the period 2008 to 2010, 45,000 agency supported jobs were lost.<\/p><p>Exports recovered again in 2010 and grew significantly during 2011 and 2012.  In the past two years, enterprise agency supported employment has increased by almost 17,000.  This is a positive development, bearing in mind the time lag between export growth and employment growth.  This lag effect is due to the fact that firms may be operating below capacity when exports start to grow, or that firms may be reluctant to increase employment until export gains are seen as long-term and sustainable.<\/p><p>There are also many variables that need to be considered in examining the correlation between employment and exports, including the constituent components of our exports which change over time as some sectors of the economy experience a decline and new sectors start to emerge and grow. It is notable that since 2002 Services Exports have increased from &euro;37 billion to over &euro;90 billion in 2012 and now account for almost half of total exports. Other variables include the competitiveness of our firms and the degree of labour intensity of various sectors, which in turn are influenced by technological and innovative improvements.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Agency supported companies: Employment and Exports 2003-2012<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th>2003<\/th><th>2004<\/th><th>2005<\/th><th>2006<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Employment<br \/>,000<\/div><\/td><td>300.2<\/td><td>298.5<\/td><td>307.8<\/td><td>319.6<\/td><td>323.7<\/td><td>316.6<\/td><td>283.6<\/td><td>278.0<\/td><td>285.8<\/td><td>294.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Exports<br \/>&euro; billion<\/div><\/td><td>92.3<\/td><td>94.9<\/td><td>101.7<\/td><td>122.8<\/td><td>132.1<\/td><td>135.6<\/td><td>124.7<\/td><td>130.1<\/td><td>140.7<\/td><td>146.3<br \/>(est.)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><bu>Notes<\/bu><b>:<\/b><\/p><p>Data on exports is compiled by Forfas in the Annual Business Survey of Economic Impacts 2011 and captures data in respect of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Udaras na Gaeltachta.<\/p><p>Data on Employment is taken from the Forfas Annual Employment Survey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Microenterprise Loan Fund Issues","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[33499\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will compare the interest rate of 8.8% payable under the microenterprise loan fund with the interest charges by banks to small and medium enterprises.

The Banks are offering standard variable rates for business loans and overdrafts for working capital at interest rates ranging from 6.5% to 8%.  The interest rate charged by MFI reflects the higher risk profile, lack of security and possibly lack of trading history of many of the MFI applicants.  The rate charged by MFI gives the customer the certainty of a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly repayments.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that with over six months trading history now behind it, MFI is currently reviewing feedback in relation to the features of the Loan Scheme in order to ensure that the loan is as accessible as possible to potential applicants while at the same time providing reasonable protection to the taxpayer and private funding underpinning the Fund. Launching a variable rate loan product is being considered as part of that review.  I should add that there is no feedback or evidence that a modest lowering of the interest rate will materially change the level of applications as the motivation for applicants to apply for the loan is based on their needs of having access to credit - having already been declined by their bank.<\/p><p>  The key challenge for MFI is to ensure that people are aware that there is support for new and existing viable businesses with perceived or real higher trading risk that have been refused credit by Banks. In that regard MFI has been engaged with key influencers across the country to get that message across. To date this has included:<\/p><p> - Meeting regularly with the Local Enterprise Offices and other support enterprise agencies at national and local level to ensure that the loan offering is understood and supported by them in their dealings with local communities;<\/p><p> - Mailshots to every TD in the country to ensure they have loan information, brochures and website details available at their regular clinics;<\/p><p> - Meeting the Banks and the Credit Review Office to ensure that they refer people declined by them to MFI;<\/p><p> - Make presentations at local micro and small business seminars and workshops across the country in order to heighten awareness of the loan fund.<\/p><p>  In addition MFI has run three radio campaigns across both national and local radio stations to raise awareness of the loan fund amongst local communities.  The loan fund is demand led and there will be on-going promotional and awareness activities to ensure that awareness of the scheme is promoted to its full potential amongst relevant micro business groups across all sectors of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000104#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Retention","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000105#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[33279\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000105#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress to date on protecting employment of staff working on the UK loan book at a company (details supplied) in County Roscommon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800 million per annum in increased GDP and 4,000 new jobs. <\/p><p>  An independent study by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), entitled 'Reducing Barriers to Transatlantic Trade', suggests the EU's economy could benefit by &euro;119 billion a year, up to 80% of which would come from cutting unnecessary costs imposed on business by having to comply with two separate sets of rules, and from liberalising trade in services and creating new access for exporters into the huge public procurement market in the U.S.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>  Given that negotiations have yet to begin, it is not possible to estimate in detail the impact on Ireland until there is greater clarity about any exchange of offers, the scale of the possible long term gains will have a positive impact on Ireland given our close trading and investment relationship with the U.S.  In addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.  While tariffs are already low on trade across the Atlantic, the objective of abolishing even these will bring benefits to business in the short term.  Tariffs that average about 3% on EU\/U.S. trade may appear insignificant but tariffs can be a tax on business and especially where trade is between company affiliates.  That is the case for a good proportion of trade between US multinationals in Ireland and the US market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000105#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000105#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[33469\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000105#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding the key commitment to develop an international content services centre; if he expects funding for such a project or similar project to come from the recently announced strategic investment fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Action Plan for Jobs is a whole of Government, national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State.  The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  Regional Aid Guidelines permit Member States to grant higher investment aid in areas suffering such structural disadvantage.  <\/p><p>  All of the enterprise development agencies have regional structures to maximise local opportunities.

Ireland's open economy needs to have the export of goods and services at the heart of its economic strategy.  The excessive growth in the reliance on property in the years up the crisis was not only unsustainable but it undermined Ireland's competitiveness in export markets and caused a steady decline in our export market share.  The economic transition which we are now undertaking must be founded solidly on exporting with the innovation and enterprise that is necessary to support it.<\/p><p>  Employment in agency supported exporting companies fell by over 46,000 between 2007 and 2010.  However in the past two years this has been reversed and 22,000 net additional persons are now at work in those exporting companies.  This has been built on strong performances by both Irish owned and foreign owned companies in export markets.  The fall in exports recorded in the first quarter has broken with this trend.  My Department and Agencies are closely monitoring this situation.  It is clear that there has not been a negative impact in employment during that first quarter.  A number of factors are at work such as the re-pricing of pharmaceutical products which are coming off patent and a downgrading of demand in many of our key trading partners.<\/p><p>  Other sources of data suggest that export growth can be sustained.  They underpin the importance of work to build up our position in export markets through initiatives in the areas of trade promotion and innovation.  In this context, Enterprise Ireland has established a Potential Exporters Division as a new way of engaging with Irish companies and providing them with mentoring, business advocate support and financial support.  A pilot initiative will also be commenced, focusing on enabling companies to research, evaluate and plan market entry strategies in new geographic markets.  A total of 15 Ministerial Trade Missions will take place in 2013 to existing and emerging markets.  <\/p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Offices will work with indigenous companies to help them realise new market opportunities.

Reductions of approximately 100 to 130 staff are expected to take place over a two-year period as these older product lines are phased out.  The company anticipate that a reduction in staff numbers will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.

This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation in procurement, the NPS and InterTradeIreland have, over the past three years, conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the public sector.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  Enterprise Ireland has also participated in these events.  To date, over 4,500 SMEs have attended events of this nature throughout the country.  SMEs are being actively encouraged to form consortia or similar business relationships to improve their bids for larger contracts.<\/p><p>  In the context of the reform of public procurement and the establishment of a national Procurement Office, my Department and Enterprise Ireland are in on-going dialogue with the new National Procurement Officer to ensure that opportunities for SMEs to access procurement opportunities are taken into consideration and that tendering criteria are proportionate.

Recent labour market figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of people under 25 years of age in employment decreased by 4,000 in the year between Quarter 1 2012 and Quarter 1 2013.  The number of unemployed people under 25 years of age fell by 10,000 in the twelve  month period to Quarter 1 2013, while the unemployment rate for young people fell from 29.7% to 26.6% over the same period.

There are a range of initiatives in place under the Action Plan and Pathways to Work to support young people looking for employment.

The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience, is a prime consideration and a real location differentiator. Attracting skilled Irish emigrants back to Ireland is an important component in creating this skill base.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide the information requested. <\/p><p>  As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, of 30 May 2013, significant measures were taken in response to concerns in the 1990s regarding Irish Registered Non-resident companies. These can be found at sections 42-51 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 as amended. <\/p><p>  The relevant measures placed the following obligations on companies wishing to incorporate in Ireland:<\/p><p>Firstly, as a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration is required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State. <\/p><p>Secondly, the Act requires that every company registered in the State is required to have and maintain at least one director that is resident in the European Economic Area or the company must hold a bond to the value of &euro;25,394.76. <\/p><p>  The requirement for either a bond or an EEA resident director does not apply if the company obtains from the Registrar of Companies a certificate that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities in the state.

The issue of employment creation is one that is challenging all Member States across the Union. Under our Presidency we have made progress in a significant number of areas that can create the right environment for growth and employment in accordance with the &ldquo;Compact for growth and jobs&rdquo; as agreed by Heads of State and Government in June 2012.  <\/p><p>  I placed a strong emphasis on advancing measures that can boost the EU&rsquo;s competitive edge globally. Overall, our Presidency achieved major successes across the policy spectrum and has significantly enhanced the reputation of this country at home and abroad.  Our good standing and reputation is a vital ingredient in making this country attractive to investors and for instilling confidence leading ultimately to jobs and growth. This will assist us in building on the average of 2,000 jobs per month created in the private sector over the last twelve months in contrast to the loss of 7,500 jobs per month during the years 2008-2010.  <\/p><p>  Within the various Council formations which I had the honour to chair, we succeeded in attaining agreements on all of the significant funding Programmes under the EU&rsquo;s new 2014-2020 Budget, itself agreed during our Presidency. For example, on the agreement on the new &euro;70 Billion research and development Programme, Horizon 2020, Ireland argued strongly, and successfully, in favour of a greater emphasis on the SME sector.  In addition to new specific supports, such as access to finance and debt and equity facilities, for SMEs, it has now been agreed that the target for SME participation in relevant areas of Horizon 2020 should be increased from 15% to 20%. This is a significant change given the proposed scale of Horizon 2020. In line with the Action Plan for Jobs we will pursue funding and other opportunities under EU Horizon 2020 for specific sectoral activities of national importance and in line with our national research priorities. <\/p><p>  Agreement was also achieved on the &euro;2.03 Billion dedicated Programme for Competitiveness and SMEs (COSME Programme) which will provide targeted financial support for SMEs. In particular, I welcome the proposed equity facility for growth-phase investment which will support the development of the EU wide Venture Capital market, as well as the Loan Facility which will provide direct or other risk sharing arrangements with financial intermediaries to cover loans for SMEs. We also built on the progress already made in reducing business costs by the administrative burden reduction efforts of the Commission and Member States. At the end of 2012 annual administrative savings totalling almost &euro;288 million representing a 19% reduction have been achieved for business in Ireland as against 2008.<\/p><p>  Proposals on State Aid Modernisation (SAM) were also agreed. These new State Aid Regulations will take account of post-crisis structural reforms and industrial restructuring which Member States are undergoing and the need for better alignment of State Aid with Europe 2020 objectives.  <\/p><p>  A number of important files which were vital to completing the EU Single Market were also agreed or significantly advanced, including those on recognition of Professional Qualifications, Public Procurement, and the Accounting Directive.  Agreement on these will make it easier to move and work across all Member States and to lower transaction costs for SMEs.<\/p><p>  In the area of Patents, remarkable progress was made to complete the Single Market in that sector with the signing of an International Agreement on a Unified Patent Court by 25 participating Member States during the Competitiveness Council on 19th February last. It has been estimated that users of the Unified Patent Court could save somewhere between &euro;148 and &euro;289 million per year, compared to the present costs of &euro;1.5 million in some Member States of such litigation.<\/p><p>  Agreement was reached at the EPSCO Council on the Youth Guarantee, which promises to provide young people with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. In addition, the European Council approved a Youth Employment Initiative amounting to &euro;6 billion for the period 2014-2020 to support measures aimed at addressing youth unemployment and, in particular, to support the Youth Guarantee for regions with particularly high levels of unemployment. Furthermore, political agreement was reached on the EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) with a proposed budget of &euro;815 million for the period 2014-20 period. EaSI will support Member States efforts in the design and implementation of employment and social reforms by means of policy coordination, identification, analysis and the sharing of best practice.<\/p><p>  Under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, we attached great importance to promoting the EU&rsquo;s external trade agenda for the benefit of Irish companies and for the wider EU economy and its exporters. Trade is essential to job creation: 30 million jobs or 10% of the EU workforce depend on exports.  In June, we reached agreement among EU Trade Ministers on the mandate to start talks on an EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Reaching agreement among EU Trade Ministers on the terms of the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate has been a top priority for the Irish Presidency.

The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2012 is estimated at 2.11% of GNP (1.71% of GDP). The estimated research intensity rate for 2013 is 2.16% of GNP (1.73% of GDP).  This is encouraging against the backdrop of the economic and fiscal situation and I believe that we are on track to achieve the research intensity target by 2020. Ireland's National Reform Programme update for 2013 submitted by the Government to the European Commission in April reflects this projection.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy has been to put in place a range of initiatives with the overarching aim of accelerating both the economic and societal return on our public investment in Science, Technology and Innovation. A number of initiatives are also in place designed to encourage more private investment in R&amp;amp;D.

It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for SMEs.

Examples of <i>InterTradeIreland's<\/i> programmes that are having a significant impact are: <b><i>Acumen<\/i><\/b>, which is designed to stimulate cross-border business for small and medium enterprises in Ireland and Northern Ireland; <b><i>Fusion<\/i><\/b><b>,<\/b> InterTradeIreland's flagship three-way partnership technology transfer programme; <b><i>Go-2-Tender<\/i><\/b>, which provides businesses with the confidence, knowledge and skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts; and <b><i>Innova<\/i><\/b>  , a unique cross-border collaborative Research &amp;amp; Development programme offering companies an opportunity to accelerate new product, process or service developments through partnering with a company in the other jurisdiction.  <\/p><p><i>  InterTradeIreland<\/i> have adapted their offering in recent years, as a result of economic circumstances, to meet the specific needs of SME's, North and South. Their key programmes are now focused on promoting trade and innovation activities among SME's which it is hoped will lead to an increase in the number of firms engaging in cross-border business and exporting to the other jurisdiction, and taking innovative steps to trading themselves out of difficult operating environments.  This approach has proved very successful.  For example, in 2012, there were 92 First Time Innovators firms (against a target of 35) and 67 First Time Exporters firms (against a target of 50) as a direct result of these firms participating in <i>InterTradeIreland's <\/i>programmes  .<\/p><p><i>InterTradeIreland<\/i> is co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, and I am glad to say that we have managed to avoid curtailing <i>InterTradeIreland's<\/i>   budget in recent years despite ongoing economic pressures.

My Department has co-funded some 28 enterprise projects, to a value of &euro;58m, under this EU Programme with the N.I. Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment over the last number of years.

It is estimated that data collected and generated by companies and governments is growing by approximately 40% per year. An independent study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( Cebr) recently identified the potential demand by businesses in Ireland for a total of 6,000 new deeply data analytics roles by 2018. <\/p><p>  In that context, the Government has agreed two specific deliverables in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 which are associated with the Industry-Government Taskforce:<\/p><p>  - To oversee a mapping of existing and planned initiatives across Government and the private sector that can contribute to Ireland's reputation as a leader in the areas of Big Data and data analytics (Q3 2013);<\/p><p>  - To identify and commence at least two new pilot initiatives whereby data analytics will be employed to address specific challenges delivering economic impact and\/or improved public services (Q3 2013).<\/p><p>  These actions are complemented by nine other actions for delivery in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs relating to areas such as R&amp;amp;D investment for data analytics, investment in high performance computing, initiatives around education and skills for data analytics, standards development and Open Government.  On 1 May 2013, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I met with the six Government-appointed industry partners to discuss the mechanisms for taking forward the Big Data disruptive reforms.  At this meeting, it was agreed that:<\/p><p>  - an Assistant Secretary General in my Department would lead the public sector engagement on the Big Data disruptive reform;<\/p><p>  - Mr Liam Casey, Ms Heather Reynolds and Mr John Herlihy would assist as industry partners in helping to deliver the Big Data disruptive reform.<\/p><p>  To progress the initiative, it was agreed to form an <i>ad hoc<\/i> working party as a precursor to the establishment of the formal Industry-Government Taskforce on Big Data and Data Analytics.

Foreign owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland's exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds. FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of new sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance, in contributing to balanced regional development and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.<\/p><p>  Ireland has earned a strong reputation for being able to compete globally for FDI. The IBM Global Location Trends Report 2012 ranks Ireland as a top location in world for Inward Investment. Ireland is listed:<\/p><p>  - First in the world for inward investment by quality and value.<\/p><p>  - First in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development.<\/p><p>  - First in Europe for investment in the Pharmaceutical sector.<\/p><p>  - Second in Europe and fourth globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.<\/p><p>  Ireland's favourable tax regime and financial support systems for research and development underline the Government's determination to continually enhance the country's attractiveness to overseas companies. The Government acknowledges that ambitious national job creation targets can only be achieved with the active co-operation of a highly skilled workforce allied to world class research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) facilities. Today, Ireland's advanced manufacturing technologies deliver continuous innovation and sustainable success in high-value manufacturing. <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that there are a number of factors which are considered by potential investors before deciding to locate here. These include: <\/p><p>  - A pro-business and technologically advanced environment.<\/p><p>  - An attractive corporate tax rate.<\/p><p>  - An educated and talented workforce. <\/p><p>  - A blend of appropriate skill sets. <\/p><p>  - Access to world class infrastructure - road access to key cities, ports and international airports. <\/p><p>  - A range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions<\/p><p>  - A track record of success coupled with the right attitude and ambition of its people.<\/p><p>  In seeking to win FDI, IDA constantly promotes the availability of these factors to potential investors.<\/p><p>  Amid significant economic challenges globally and locally, IDA Ireland achieved a strong FDI performance in 2012. There were 145 individual investments, with over 40% from companies coming to Ireland for the first time. 12,722 gross job gains were generated with 6,570 net new jobs gains across a broad range of sectors.  Helping FDI clients to transform their operations within Ireland has also led to a significant reduction in employment losses, producing a strong year overall.  Despite this success, Ireland faces a highly competitive landscape, with notable strong competition for FDI arising from the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular. Key global markets are slowing down, particularly in Europe, which is a key focus for IDA's existing and potential clients. <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has assured me, however, that there are definite opportunities for growth in the IT\/technology sector, in specific areas of financial services, in life sciences, in social\/digital media and in sectors where consolidation is taking place on a pan-European basis. The IDA's global team is determined to pursue these opportunities vigorously in 2013 in order to ensure that another 132 new investment projects, which will yield another 6,000 net new jobs, are won in accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000107#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health and Safety Inspection Numbers","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000107#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[33513\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000107#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of health and safety inspections undertaken last year and the target for inspections in the coming year.","asker":"1022","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational safety and health law, promoting and encouraging accident prevention, and providing information and advice to all companies, organisations and individuals.

Insofar as prices in this jurisdiction are concerned, the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 639 of 2002) require traders to indicate the selling price in Euros of products offered for sale. The Regulations, which are enforced by the National Consumer Agency (NCA), do not prevent traders from indicating the price of those goods in other currencies such as Sterling, so long as the Euro price is indicated.<\/p><p>  I am aware that some goods in addition to carrying the mandatory Euro price also carry a Sterling Price indication. I also am aware of concerns that have been raised in the past in relation to differentials as and between the sterling and euro prices for certain dual priced goods. Where there is a significant difference between the euro price and the sterling price for a good, it is primarily a matter for the trader concerned to explain to his\/her customers why he\/she is imposing such different prices. I would encourage any consumer who is concerned in relation to the differential between the euro and sterling prices for goods in particular retail outlets to demand an explanation from the retailers concerned as to the reasons for such differentials. If consumers are unhappy in relation to the differential in prices or the explanation for such differentials, they may wish to seek better value elsewhere.<\/p><p>  In this regard the National Consumer Agency, as part of its statutory mandate, conducts regular price comparison surveys to provide consumers with information as to the different price offerings that are available in the marketplace. Evidence available to the Agency shows that consumers have become much more discerning in relation to their shopping habits, are actively seeking better value for money and that price is becoming a pre-eminent determinant in relation to where they do their shopping. Consumers can and are demonstrating their willingness to positively seek out value and are not prepared to give their custom to traders, who they do not believe offer value for money.<\/p><p>  As regards general price comparisons between this country and the UK, the most recent Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is the accepted measure for comparing price inflation across the EU, found that prices in Ireland had risen by 0.5% in the 12 months to April 2013, whereas prices in the UK had risen by 2.4% in the same period. It is clear, therefore, that we are becoming more competitive price wise in comparison with the UK.

The latest session of this dialogue took place on 25 June 2013 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment.  At this meeting, the EU also enquired about measures taken so far by China to ratify the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998 in view of China&rsquo;s undertaking made during the 2009 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to ratify the Covenant at an early date. <\/p><p>  In February 2013, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association.

Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, including those related to the Falun Gong, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels, including at the next United Nations Universal Periodic Review of human rights in China, scheduled for October 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000108#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000108#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[33749\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000108#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to advertise all temporary, contractual, permanent and other similar forms of attach&eacute; positions at various embassies and diplomatic missions publicly through forms such as the Public Appointments Service and publicjobs.ie in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In addition, most items applying currently at the 13.5% cannot be reduced below 12%.<\/p><p>As stated earlier, the costings in the table relation to the 9% VAT rate relates to 2013 figures.  From 2014 all goods and services applying at this rate are scheduled to revert to 13.5%, and so any change that would result in a rate lower than 13.5% on this activity would result in a cost to the Exchequer. However, costings in relation to the items currently at the 9% rate for 2014 are not yet available.

Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  In relation to assessment for special needs resourcing, I might add that NEPS psychologists would normally only have input into the process in relation to pupils with General Learning Difficulties (GLD) and Emotional Disturbance\/ Behavioural Disorders (EDBD) with other types of special needs, such as for example, Autism are referred to clinicians for diagnosis.  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above and advise that the school in question may raise individual pupils with the NEPS service if they have concerns in this regard.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.

The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe\/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.  This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.<\/p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.

In executing its mandate, IDA Ireland engages with corporate entities, as the primary decision makers around FDI investment.  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points, including an attractive corporate tax rate.  IDA Ireland recently undertook a media road-show in New York to counter claims that Ireland is a tax haven and to explain how the Irish corporate tax system operates. The media road-show involved a prime time speaking opportunity on CNBC, the most watched business news network in the United States. The resulting interview was subsequently re-cycled through various social media channels. The Chief Executive of IDA, Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, also held briefings with correspondents from influential outlets including the New York Times and Bloomberg on the issue of Corporate Tax and FDI.

The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.<\/p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy.

Along with the Taoiseach, Tanaiste and Minister Burton, I launched the new JobsPlus Incentive on 8 July.  JobsPlus is a new initiative which encourages employers to offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed.<\/p><p>  The Incentive will provide two levels of payment: a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years to an employer for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 12 months, but less than 24 months, and a payment of &euro;10,000 over two years for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months.  The new Incentive will be payable monthly in arrears.  In order to qualify, an employer must offer full time employment of at least 30 hours per week, spanning at least four days per week, to eligible recruits.<\/p><p>  Details of the full range of services available to employers through Intreo, and of the JobsPlus initiative are available on the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector Issues","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02150"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[33661\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he continues to monitor the various contributing factors in the closure of retail outlets with consequent job losses; if high rents\/rates has emerged as a contributing factor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>In the current economic climate, a range of factors are impacting on closures of retail outlets, including changing patterns of consumer behaviour through on-line trading.<\/p><p>  I am aware that many retail companies are concerned about the impact which rates and rents - particularly upward only rent reviews - are having on their cost base.  When the Government came into office, it gave extensive consideration to abolishing upward-only rent reviews in leases signed before 28th February 2010. The advice received by the Government was that it was not possible to develop a scheme to tackle this issue that would not be vulnerable to a Constitutional challenge or compensation claims from landlords. On the basis of this advice, the Government concluded that it was not feasible to legislate to abolish upward only rent reviews.<\/p><p>  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.<\/p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific commitments to support the retail sector, including an initiative to increase the number of businesses trading on-line and a project to develop a single business licence application portal for the sector.  My Department is also chairing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group comprises key Government Departments and has already met with the main representative bodies for the retail sector.  The Group will hold a further series of meetings with other stakeholders this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02350"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[33662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will examine the situation whereby workers from non-EU countries who have been in full-time employment, paid their taxes and were of the understanding that their works permits had been updated and in order and who now find that they were\/are illegally employed obviously through no fault of their own with a view to ensuring that they can regularise their position without discrimination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to foreign nationals as defined under the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 as foreign nationals other than nationals of member states of the EEA and Switzerland, often referred to as 3rd country nationals.  The law is clear on the matter of employment of 3rd country nationals - it is illegal for such a 3rd country national to be employed without the State&rsquo;s permission and it is an offence for both the 3rd country national and the employer concerned.  Illegal employment of 3rd country nationals creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>  Following the result of this in the High Court judgement concerning Mr. Younis, I committed to amending the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter. Also, subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce new safeguards in the legislation that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that a contract of employment is illegal and therefore not legally binding.<\/p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill, subject to Government approval, will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with 3rd country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a 3rd country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permits&rsquo; regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date.  Such people may have established roots in Ireland and it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit.<\/p><p>  There will be three overriding principles concerning an application for an Employment Permit of this type. Firstly, the application process and administration must be clear and approachable from the perspective of an applicant. Secondly, the employee concerned must have originally entered the labour market legally through the Employment Permits system. I do not want to create a mechanism capable of abuse or considered as an alternative to the normal Employment Permit process. Also, it is logical that an Employment Permits Bill deals only with Employment Permits matters. The third principle will be that the employee must not currently be in employment illegally &ndash; it would be nonsensical for an applicant to apply for a permit under one section of the Act whilst at the same time potentially committing an offence under another section of the Act.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches.<\/p><p>  Finally, in terms of the current status of the Employment Permits Bill, the drafting process is almost concluded. I am expecting a further draft of the Bill this week and subject to it fully meeting policy objectives I envisage submitting it to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02550"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[33663\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of jobs created and jobs lost in County Kildare in each of the past three years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by the enterprise development agencies.

PRSI credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system.  For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.

The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means:<\/p><p>- by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:<\/p><p>- eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015. <\/p><p>- UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015.<\/p><p>- Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.<\/p><p>- Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The operators are obliged, under the terms of the licences, to cover 70% of the population. <\/p><p>- ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. <\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy, which I will launch on 11 July next, will target specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital adoption and to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRN02150"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[33638\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the rationale behind the National Oil Reserve Agency duty; if this duty acts a competitive disadvantage to Irish producers of firelighters or firelogs as compared to companies who have firelighters or firelogs produced in Britain who can thus avoid NORA duty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[33687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has received representations from a company (details supplied) in County Louth in relation to the possibility of granting an exemption from the NORA levy pursuant to sections 38 of the NORA Act 2007; if such representations have been considered; if a decision has been made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 together.<\/p><p>  It is a condition of EU and International Energy Agency (IEA) membership that all Member States maintain certain levels of strategic oil reserves to maintain security of oil supply.

It is a matter for each Member State to decide on the manner in which they fund this security of supply obligation and this will vary from Member State to Member State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and is funded by way of a levy on disposals of petroleum products and by bank borrowings.

By the end of April 2013, the situation has dramatically improved and the split is now 74% as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 26% as physical stocks in other EU Member States.<\/p><p>  In 2007, NORA held approximately 75 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day strategic stockholding obligation.  Today NORA holds 88 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day obligation.  This increase has come about largely due to the implementation of the new EU Oil Stocks Directive (Directive 2009\/119\/EC), which came into effect on 1 January 2013, whereby commercial stocks may no longer be counted towards a country&rsquo;s strategic stockholding.<\/p><p>  As an island nation with limited refining capacity and no indigenous oil production, the physical availability of already refined strategic oil product stocks on the island, as part of our strategic oil stocks, improves our security of supply position, particularly in the event of prolonged weather disruption which might make imports difficult.  It was considered that the over-reliance on stock tickets (short term contracts for the supply of oil in the event of an emergency), created a vulnerability in the event of supply disruption and this has now been eliminated.  There are also benefits to the national economy of holding the strategic stocks on the island of Ireland. In this context, a policy has been pursued since 2007 of rebalancing the wholly owned strategic stocks onto the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The lack of physical infrastructure on the island available for oil storage required NORA to develop its own new storage facilities which took time as well as additional funding and staffing resources.  NORA pursued all options for increasing storage capacity in Ireland, including maximising its use of existing commercial storage and refurbishing existing storage facilities for its own use.  In the last 3 years, NORA has refurbished and commissioned three new oil storage facilities on the island &ndash; in Dublin, Kerry and Antrim, providing a total of an additional 320,000 tonnes of storage.  NORA will continue to seek out new storage facilities and opportunities subject to value for money in line with Government policy.  Stocks held in other EU Member States are held in Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Denmark.  These stocks are held under Member State to Member State bilateral agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":503,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 180.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Administration","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO00250"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[33678\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain final reminder notices sent in relation to the payment of the non-principal private residence charge due on 30 June 2013 were not received until after the closing date as in the case of a person (details supplied); if he will outline the procedures that are in place to ensure this does not happen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A key conclusion in that regard is that such an office should not be simply inserted as a further layer of governance and administration in addition to the current local government structures.<\/p><p>  The establishment of an office with more far-reaching powers, functions and budgetary capacity would be likely to require significant changes in existing local government arrangements. The implications in this regard and the changes required at local government level would need to be considered carefully and include issues in regard to the powers, structures and functions of such an office and consequential changes in the powers, structures and functions of local authorities and other relevant bodies, budgetary matters, strategic co-ordination, an elected assembly with oversight and accountability functions, avoidance of duplication, maximisation of efficiency in local government arrangements, avoidance of cost increases and achievement of savings. The Action Programme indicated that a special forum or colloquium of the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils and Dublin City Council would be convened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to consider the options for local governance in Dublin, including the potential for a directly elected Mayor for a Dublin Metropolitan Area.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.<\/p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.<\/p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution. My Department is currently preparing updated guidance in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s latest Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Elections","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO01850"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[33704\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will address the prospect of supporting towns who wish to continue with some form of representative group by way of assistance with such elections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>Policy in relation to democratic representation in local government is clearly set out in the Government's Action Programme for Effective Local Government .

For this reason I have set the challenging target of introducing a ban on smoky coal across the State within the next three years. However, I fully recognise the cross-border enforcement difficulties arising, if a national ban is introduced unilaterally in the South rather than on an all-island basis. A closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis will allow the benefits derived from the ban potentially to be further extended. In this regard, the policy options identified following the conclusion of the joint study will steer further legislative development in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Referendum Campaigns","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[28688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the Referendum Commission will be established for the referendum on the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1066","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>On 6 June 2013 I signed the Referendum Commission (Establishment) Order 2013 which established a Referendum Commission for the referendum on the proposal in the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":546,"content":"<p>Question No. 203 answered with Question No. 187.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unfinished Housing Developments","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP01200"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[33910\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the scheme for taking in charge of private housing estates needs to be revised to take in the circumstances where the developer is deceased or is no longer in business, in effect the local authority has no recourse for the snag list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 applies to estates which have been granted planning permission and includes the construction of two or more houses (which as defined in the Act includes apartments) and the provision of new roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.

To underpin this strategy the Irish Prison Service intends to introduce a Dignity at Work Charter and a prison wide dignity and respect campaign with the aim of creating a positive and caring environment for staff and prisoners.  Everyone in the Irish Prison service should be committed to treating everyone fairly, with courtesy, respecting personal dignity at all times.  These principles will be at the heart of what the Irish Prison Service sets out to achieve in the coming years and into the future in all strategic actions.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Director General that a Working Group, comprising of representatives from Human Resources and Corporate Affairs Directorates, the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, the Legal and Professional Standards Unit, the Employee Assistance Service and the Psychology Service, was established to deliver on this commitment.

On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning, including Integrated Sentence Management, and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<\/p><p>  In relation to participation in education programmes, the aim of the Prison Service places a strong emphasis on improving prisoners' employability prospects through Work Training activities and accredited vocational training courses. Over 100 workshops and service activities operate across the prison estate and the number of accredited courses and activities has increased in recent years. There are now over 100 qualifications available across 20 skill sets. 1,459 prisoners participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2012 - up from 314 in 2007 - and 1,030 prisoners received certificates in the last year.<\/p><p>  A wide range of training workshops and service activities are operating in the Midlands Prison. These include carpentry, metalwork, computers, laundry, waste management, horticulture, industrial cleaning and catering. Prisoners housed in the new accommodation block in the Midlands have access to the existing Work Training and Education activities alongside other constructive activities such as gyms, paint parties, cleaning, and reception work. In addition to a recently opened 'bag and Tag' Tuckshop facility, the new block will also include workshop activities in printing\/computers, catering training and light industry\/craftwork. Soft skills programmes will also be facilitated in the new block.<\/p><p>  In November, 2012, prior to the opening of the new block, an average of 108 inmates were engaged in work training activities in Midlands Prison compared with an average of 123 inmates in May, 2013. It is envisaged that the additional activities will come on stream in the near future once vacancies in the Work Training Officer (WTO) grade are filled through a competition which will be held in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs (220 in the academic year 2012\/13).<\/p><p>  Ten general purpose rooms have been re-designated in the new block for education purposes, this equates to approximately 70 additional places. Prior to the opening of the new block 280 students attended classes per week. During the week ending 3 May 2013, 348 students attended classes. At present the formal academic year is complete and the summer programme is running with limited resources - 150 students attended classes during week ending 5 July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Numbers","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[33908\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners currently housed in each wing of Mountjoy Prison, Dublin; the number of prisoners in each wing currently housed in single occupancy cells; the number of prisoners in each wing currently housed in cells with one other prisoner; the number of prisoners in each wing currently housed in cells with more than one other prisoner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that on Monday, 8th July, 2013, the number of prisoners currently housed in each wing of Mountjoy Prison was as follows:-<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Wing<\/th><th>No.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>B Division:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>119<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C Division:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C - Base:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D Division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>211<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Medical Unit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>53<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Separation Unit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Wing<\/th><th>Number in Single Occupancy Cells<\/th><th>Number in  Double Occupancy Cells<\/th><th>Number housed with more than 1 other<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>B- Division<\/td><td><div>119<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C- Division<\/td><td><div>92<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C-Base<\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D - Division<\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>130<\/div><\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Medical Unit<\/td><td><div>46<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Separation Unit<\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>42<\/div><\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>308<\/div><\/td><td><div>172<\/div><\/td><td><div>68<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Once the current refurbishment project has been completed in September 2013, all prisoners in Mountjoy prison will be accommodated in a single cell with a wash hand basin and toilet.

","asker":"1019","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>The Study of Young Carers in the Irish Population, published by my Department in 2010, highlights the importance of creating a better understanding of children as carers in Ireland.  It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population. <\/p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  People of all ages were asked whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability.  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Overall, 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  It is further planned, under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives published by my Department in November 2011, that a detailed analysis of those children who report in the 2011 Census that they undertake caring roles, will be carried out by the end of 2013.  It is anticipated that the analysis will inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. <\/p><p>  In 2012 the Department of Health published The National Carers&rsquo; Strategy &ndash; Recognised, Supported, Empowered.  The strategy recognizes that although the needs of young carers can be similar to carers of any age, they may have additional needs, which include support in education to help them to achieve their full potential.  <\/p><p>  My Department has been supporting the implementation of this strategy by ensuring that the children strategies which it is developing are cognisant of the necessity to make them as &lsquo;carer friendly&rsquo; as possible.  However, given the young age that the Childcare Directorate is dealing with, the number of cases where children might be carers is very small.  <\/p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) the following actions have been taken that are relevant to the Carers Strategy:  - Child care staff have been alerted to the strategy and its relevance to children with carer responsibilities; - Strategy disseminated to key children and family services staff; - Linkages between carer responsibilities and child protection issues have been highlighted to staff<\/p><p>  The National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.<\/p><p>  The NEWB has made significant progress towards delivering an integrated school support service based on the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&quot;.  This streamlined national approach will enhance education support services and enable the NEWB to respond appropriately to the circumstances in which children and families need help from NEWB.  Consultation on the practice model started in October 2012 and concluded early in 2013.  The model is also being developed to complement and link with models of practice and methods of working proposed by the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) within its proposed National Service Delivery Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRQ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[33690\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the proposals put forward by the co-ordinator of the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme with the support of the three primary schools (details supplied); if she has considered the proposals; and if she will respond to same.

Following receipt of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my officials have established that the programme is seeking funding of &euro;35,044.88 to create a new post of Traveller Education Support Worker to serve the primary schools in the project.  I am also aware that this proposal was submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, for his consideration.  The National Educational Welfare Board, which operates under the remit of my Department, is responsible for the operational management of the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.  In delivering on this role, the board works closely with management committees, schools and local Home School Community Liaison Scheme and School Completion Programme co-ordinators to ensure student supports and interventions are tailored to meet local needs.  As the services of the National Educational Welfare Board are central to this proposal, I will ask it to engage directly with the schools and the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate consideration of the proposal in the appropriate context.<\/p><p>  It should be recognised that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme operates under the direction of a Local Management Committee.  This Committee assesses local needs to devise a programme of student supports and interventions, known as the Retention Plan, to support identified young people at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life.  Funding is provided by my Department following approval of annual plans by the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme received funding of &euro;193,754 in the current academic year.  The project model approach enables creative and innovative local strategies to be developed.  Therefore, it is open to the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme to consider its priority requirements, including the present proposal, within the existing planning and funding cycle.  Furthermore, within its targeting process, the schools involved should identify and prioritise at-risk children, including those from within the Traveller community, for available supports.<\/p><p>  In planning its programme of supports, the Local Management Committee must have regard to the full extent of DEIS resources provided to its schools.  Given the need to achieve saving in the School Completion Programme in 2013 and 2014, a coherent approach in the use of all school resources will ensure available funds are committed to those services which provide the greatest contribution to children's educational outcomes.  Projects are finalising proposals for the next academic year.  The National Educational Welfare Board will work with the Local Management Committee to examine this proposal in the context of its suite of supports and interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Genetically Modified Organisms","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[33681\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000111#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his policy in relation on the labelling of GMO ingredients in foods.","asker":"1034","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>Ireland adopts a &ldquo;positive but precautionary&rdquo; stance on GMO food and feed matters, considers the advice of EFSA with regard to authorisations, and votes with the European Commission once assured of the safety of the product.

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has now implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013\/2014 school year.

advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act provides the legal framework for the delivery of education to children through recognised schools.  All recognised schools are legally owned by the school patrons or trustees and managed by a school's Board of Management which is also the employer of teachers in a school.  While the Minister for Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor officials of my Department have powers to investigate individual complaints, except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.<\/p><p>  If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities.  The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.  If a parent has a complaint about a teacher or about the school, the first step is to speak to the class teacher, if the complaint is not resolved, the parent should then speak to the school principal.  If the complaint is not resolved at this stage the parent can lodge the complaint in writing with the chairperson of the school's Board of Management\/Single Manager\/VEC.<\/p><p>  If the parent has exhausted the school's complaints procedure and the complaint has not been resolved, the parent can make an appeal to the Ombudsman for Children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the School has had a negative affect on a child.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  In relation to assessment for special needs resourcing, I might add that NEPS psychologists would normally only have input into the process in relation to pupils with General Learning Difficulties (GLD) and Emotional Disturbance\/ Behavioural Disorders (EDBD) with other types of special needs, such as for example, Autism are referred to clinicians for diagnosis.

The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.

In executing its mandate, IDA Ireland engages with corporate entities, as the primary decision makers around FDI investment.  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points, including an attractive corporate tax rate.  IDA Ireland recently undertook a media road-show in New York to counter claims that Ireland is a tax haven and to explain how the Irish corporate tax system operates. The media road-show involved a prime time speaking opportunity on CNBC, the most watched business news network in the United States. The resulting interview was subsequently re-cycled through various social media channels. The Chief Executive of IDA, Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, also held briefings with correspondents from influential outlets including the New York Times and Bloomberg on the issue of Corporate Tax and FDI.

The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.<\/p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy.

The law is clear on the matter of employment of 3rd country nationals - it is illegal for such a 3rd country national to be employed without the State&rsquo;s permission and it is an offence for both the 3rd country national and the employer concerned.  Illegal employment of 3rd country nationals creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>  Following the result of this in the High Court judgement concerning Mr. Younis, I committed to amending the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter. Also, subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce new safeguards in the legislation that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that a contract of employment is illegal and therefore not legally binding.<\/p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill, subject to Government approval, will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with 3rd country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a 3rd country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permits&rsquo; regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date.  Such people may have established roots in Ireland and it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit.<\/p><p>  There will be three overriding principles concerning an application for an Employment Permit of this type. Firstly, the application process and administration must be clear and approachable from the perspective of an applicant. Secondly, the employee concerned must have originally entered the labour market legally through the Employment Permits system. I do not want to create a mechanism capable of abuse or considered as an alternative to the normal Employment Permit process. Also, it is logical that an Employment Permits Bill deals only with Employment Permits matters. The third principle will be that the employee must not currently be in employment illegally &ndash; it would be nonsensical for an applicant to apply for a permit under one section of the Act whilst at the same time potentially committing an offence under another section of the Act.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches.<\/p><p>  Finally, in terms of the current status of the Employment Permits Bill, the drafting process is almost concluded.

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.

The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means:<\/p><p>- by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan with investments of up to &euro;1bn underway.  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:<\/p><p>- eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16th May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015. <\/p><p>- UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015.<\/p><p>- Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.<\/p><p>- Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The operators are obliged, under the terms of the licences, to cover 70% of the population. <\/p><p>- ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. <\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy, which I will launch on 11 July next, will target specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital adoption and to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000116#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":912,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000116#WRN02150"},{"type":"question","counter":913,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[33638\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000116#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the rationale behind the National Oil Reserve Agency duty; if this duty acts a competitive disadvantage to Irish producers of firelighters or firelogs as compared to companies who have firelighters or firelogs produced in Britain who can thus avoid NORA duty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[33687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000116#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has received representations from a company (details supplied) in County Louth in relation to the possibility of granting an exemption from the NORA levy pursuant to sections 38 of the NORA Act 2007; if such representations have been considered; if a decision has been made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 together.<\/p><p>  It is a condition of EU and International Energy Agency (IEA) membership that all Member States maintain certain levels of strategic oil reserves to maintain security of oil supply.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s 90 days of strategic oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.  It is a matter for each Member State to decide on the manner in which they fund this security of supply obligation and this will vary from Member State to Member State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and is funded by way of a levy on disposals of petroleum products and by bank borrowings.  I do not believe that the NORA levy creates competition issues between EU Member States.  All Member States have to bear the cost of the strategic oil stocks requirement and ultimately this requirement will be transferred by way of price inclusion to consumers.<\/p><p>  The NORA levy is not imposed directly on firelighters or fire logs as such, although oil may be a constituent element of such products and the levy would be payable on that constituent part.

By the end of April 2013, the situation has dramatically improved and the split is now 74% as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 26% as physical stocks in other EU Member States.<\/p><p>  In 2007, NORA held approximately 75 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day strategic stockholding obligation.  Today NORA holds 88 of Ireland&rsquo;s total 90 day obligation.  This increase has come about largely due to the implementation of the new EU Oil Stocks Directive (Directive 2009\/119\/EC), which came into effect on 1 January 2013, whereby commercial stocks may no longer be counted towards a country&rsquo;s strategic stockholding.<\/p><p>  As an island nation with limited refining capacity and no indigenous oil production, the physical availability of already refined strategic oil product stocks on the island, as part of our strategic oil stocks, improves our security of supply position, particularly in the event of prolonged weather disruption which might make imports difficult.  It was considered that the over-reliance on stock tickets (short term contracts for the supply of oil in the event of an emergency), created a vulnerability in the event of supply disruption and this has now been eliminated.  There are also benefits to the national economy of holding the strategic stocks on the island of Ireland. In this context, a policy has been pursued since 2007 of rebalancing the wholly owned strategic stocks onto the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The lack of physical infrastructure on the island available for oil storage required NORA to develop its own new storage facilities which took time as well as additional funding and staffing resources.  NORA pursued all options for increasing storage capacity in Ireland, including maximising its use of existing commercial storage and refurbishing existing storage facilities for its own use.  In the last 3 years, NORA has refurbished and commissioned three new oil storage facilities on the island &ndash; in Dublin, Kerry and Antrim, providing a total of an additional 320,000 tonnes of storage.  NORA will continue to seek out new storage facilities and opportunities subject to value for money in line with Government policy.  Stocks held in other EU Member States are held in Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Denmark.  These stocks are held under Member State to Member State bilateral agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000116#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":924,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 180.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":926,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Administration","counter":925,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO00250"},{"type":"question","counter":926,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[33678\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain final reminder notices sent in relation to the payment of the non-principal private residence charge due on 30 June 2013 were not received until after the closing date as in the case of a person (details supplied); if he will outline the procedures that are in place to ensure this does not happen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Action Programme indicated that a special forum or colloquium of the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils and Dublin City Council would be convened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to consider the options for local governance in Dublin, including the potential for a directly elected Mayor for a Dublin Metropolitan Area.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.<\/p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.<\/p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution. My Department is currently preparing updated guidance in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s latest Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Elections","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO01850"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[33704\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000117#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will address the prospect of supporting towns who wish to continue with some form of representative group by way of assistance with such elections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":949,"content":"<p>Policy in relation to democratic representation in local government is clearly set out in the Government's Action Programme for Effective Local Government .

Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000118#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000118#WRP01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":971,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000118#WRP01500"},{"type":"question","counter":972,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[33635\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000118#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to tackle the issue of boy racers and modified cars which are causing difficulties for residents in certain areas (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":973,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that I share the concern about incidents of anti-social driving behaviour and the impact it has on local communities.

At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning, including Integrated Sentence Management, and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<\/p><p>  In relation to participation in education programmes, the aim of the Prison Service places a strong emphasis on improving prisoners' employability prospects through Work Training activities and accredited vocational training courses. Over 100 workshops and service activities operate across the prison estate and the number of accredited courses and activities has increased in recent years. There are now over 100 qualifications available across 20 skill sets. 1,459 prisoners participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2012 - up from 314 in 2007 - and 1,030 prisoners received certificates in the last year.<\/p><p>  A wide range of training workshops and service activities are operating in the Midlands Prison. These include carpentry, metalwork, computers, laundry, waste management, horticulture, industrial cleaning and catering. Prisoners housed in the new accommodation block in the Midlands have access to the existing Work Training and Education activities alongside other constructive activities such as gyms, paint parties, cleaning, and reception work. In addition to a recently opened 'bag and Tag' Tuckshop facility, the new block will also include workshop activities in printing\/computers, catering training and light industry\/craftwork.

It is envisaged that the additional activities will come on stream in the near future once vacancies in the Work Training Officer (WTO) grade are filled through a competition which will be held in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning.

","asker":"1019","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1040,"content":"<p>The Study of Young Carers in the Irish Population, published by my Department in 2010, highlights the importance of creating a better understanding of children as carers in Ireland.  It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population. <\/p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  People of all ages were asked whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability.  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Overall, 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  It is further planned, under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives published by my Department in November 2011, that a detailed analysis of those children who report in the 2011 Census that they undertake caring roles, will be carried out by the end of 2013.  It is anticipated that the analysis will inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. <\/p><p>  In 2012 the Department of Health published The National Carers&rsquo; Strategy &ndash; Recognised, Supported, Empowered.  The strategy recognizes that although the needs of young carers can be similar to carers of any age, they may have additional needs, which include support in education to help them to achieve their full potential.  <\/p><p>  My Department has been supporting the implementation of this strategy by ensuring that the children strategies which it is developing are cognisant of the necessity to make them as &lsquo;carer friendly&rsquo; as possible.  However, given the young age that the Childcare Directorate is dealing with, the number of cases where children might be carers is very small.  <\/p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) the following actions have been taken that are relevant to the Carers Strategy:  - Child care staff have been alerted to the strategy and its relevance to children with carer responsibilities; - Strategy disseminated to key children and family services staff; - Linkages between carer responsibilities and child protection issues have been highlighted to staff<\/p><p>  The National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.<\/p><p>  The NEWB has made significant progress towards delivering an integrated school support service based on the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&quot;.  This streamlined national approach will enhance education support services and enable the NEWB to respond appropriately to the circumstances in which children and families need help from NEWB.  Consultation on the practice model started in October 2012 and concluded early in 2013.  The model is also being developed to complement and link with models of practice and methods of working proposed by the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) within its proposed National Service Delivery Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000119#WRQ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[33690\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the proposals put forward by the co-ordinator of the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme with the support of the three primary schools (details supplied); if she has considered the proposals; and if she will respond to same.

Following receipt of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, my officials have established that the programme is seeking funding of &euro;35,044.88 to create a new post of Traveller Education Support Worker to serve the primary schools in the project.  I am also aware that this proposal was submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, for his consideration.  The National Educational Welfare Board, which operates under the remit of my Department, is responsible for the operational management of the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.  In delivering on this role, the board works closely with management committees, schools and local Home School Community Liaison Scheme and School Completion Programme co-ordinators to ensure student supports and interventions are tailored to meet local needs.  As the services of the National Educational Welfare Board are central to this proposal, I will ask it to engage directly with the schools and the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate consideration of the proposal in the appropriate context.<\/p><p>  It should be recognised that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme operates under the direction of a Local Management Committee.  This Committee assesses local needs to devise a programme of student supports and interventions, known as the Retention Plan, to support identified young people at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life.  Funding is provided by my Department following approval of annual plans by the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme received funding of &euro;193,754 in the current academic year.  The project model approach enables creative and innovative local strategies to be developed.  Therefore, it is open to the Dominican Campus School Completion Programme to consider its priority requirements, including the present proposal, within the existing planning and funding cycle.  Furthermore, within its targeting process, the schools involved should identify and prioritise at-risk children, including those from within the Traveller community, for available supports.<\/p><p>  In planning its programme of supports, the Local Management Committee must have regard to the full extent of DEIS resources provided to its schools.  Given the need to achieve saving in the School Completion Programme in 2013 and 2014, a coherent approach in the use of all school resources will ensure available funds are committed to those services which provide the greatest contribution to children's educational outcomes.  Projects are finalising proposals for the next academic year.  The National Educational Welfare Board will work with the Local Management Committee to examine this proposal in the context of its suite of supports and interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1046,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Genetically Modified Organisms","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[33681\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013071000120#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his policy in relation on the labelling of GMO ingredients in foods.","asker":"1034","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>Ireland adopts a &ldquo;positive but precautionary&rdquo; stance on GMO food and feed matters, considers the advice of EFSA with regard to authorisations, and votes with the European Commission once assured of the safety of the product.

The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role. <\/p><p>The NTPF has been working to rationalise its internal structures and to establish new functional areas that reflect its evolving role.
