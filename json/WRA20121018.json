According to the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey for April to June 2012, the largest increase in employment in any sector over the year to June 2012 was in tourism-related jobs, with employment in the Accommodation and Food sector increasing by 5.9% or 6,300 jobs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  As regards arrivals, following a return to growth last year for the first time since 2007, the latest CSO figures show that overseas visits to Ireland in January-August 2012 showed a marginal decrease of 1.4% when compared to 2011, while the peak June-August period saw a fall of 2% in trips.\u00a0 At main market level, results were mixed.  Despite continued growth from continental Europe &ndash; the main source of overseas tourism revenue - and from the high-spending other areas of developing markets, there was a decline in trips from Great Britain and a slight decline from North America.\u00a0 The British market in particular is proving difficult, with a flat economy and weak consumer confidence having a significant impact on outbound travel generally, while the Olympics generally seemed to have limited effect on consumer demand in Britain.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland has been conducting an extensive promotional programme this year, focused on our main markets including Britain and North America.  Its autumn campaign aims to boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the globe, as well as promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013.\u00a0 For next year, The Gathering will form the central focus of all tourism campaigns, with the work carried out by the Tourism Recovery Taskforce further informing marketing plans and activity in British and North American markets.<\/p><p>  \u00a0An important part of improving tourist numbers from foreign markets is air access.  The Dublin Airport Authority has some very attractive incentive schemes in place, including a long-haul incentive scheme, offering significant discounts on various charges for airlines opening up new routes.  In particular, air access to the North American market is crucial to success in that tourist market.<\/p><p>  As part of a recent tourist mission to North America to promote the Gathering, I met with United Airlines in Chicago and a new Chicago-Shannon route has been confirmed for next summer.\u00a0 Discussions are ongoing with a number of other carriers for additional capacity linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic linked to the Gathering.<\/p><p>  Current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, which was in the region of 27,500 seats per week.  Tourism Ireland continues to work closely with Dublin Airport Authority to secure additional capacity.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tourism performance is dependent on improvements in the economic situation and consumer confidence in overseas markets, as well as the efforts of the industry and the agencies to promote our tourism offering and deliver a competitive and quality product.\u00a0 Using The Gathering as our centrepiece for 2013, working with Tourism Ireland to sell Ireland as a destination overseas and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to continually strengthen the competitiveness of our product, I am confident that we can grow tourist numbers and employment in the sector for 2013 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haulage Industry Regulation","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[45161\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he has identified or examined the issues currently affecting the transport sector in a negative way; if he has had discussions with stakeholders who may be affected by rising fuel costs or other issues; if any particular proposals have emerged which might address any such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[45520\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he has received communication from the transport sector in the matter of identification of cost factors likely to inhibit growth or development in the industry in the coming year; the measures taken or likely to be taken to address such factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[45522\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he continues to engage with the stakeholders in the industries under his aegis with a view of maximisation of job creation opportunities of consequent reduction in unemployment levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[45523\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he has studied the costs associated with the transport sector with particular reference to the extent to which fuel prices now negatively impact on this sector; if he has received submissions from the representative bodies in this regard; if any intervention can be made unilaterally or in conjunction with his EU colleagues with a view to ensuring that fuel prices here are competitive with those prevailing throughout the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 248, 250 and 251 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  These questions relate to the Haulage Industry.<\/p><p><br \/>  The predominant element of transport costs is fuel.

That\u00a0Act provides for the regulation of quotes or other communications by traders to consumers relating to the price of goods and services, including car rentals.\u00a0 Consumers who have been subject to misleading or unfair practices by car rental companies\u00a0may make a complaint to the Agency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I am also informed by the NCA that\u00a0under\u00a0Article 22 of Directive 2011\/83\/EU on Consumer Rights,\u00a0a trader must\u00a0seek the express consent of the consumer to any extra payment in addition to the\u00a0payment agreed upon for the trader&rsquo;s main contractual obligation.  If this express consent is not obtained\u00a0but has been inferred\u00a0by using default options which the consumer is required to reject in order to avoid the additional payment, then the consumer shall be entitled to reimbursement of this payment.\u00a0 I understand that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation intends to enact Regulations giving effect to Article 22 by the end of 2012 or in early 2013.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1074"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[45241\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is in a position to provide any further funding to advance a study to narrow the route corridor of the proposed N2 A5 motorway project in County Monaghan between Clontibret and Moy Bridge between now and the end of 2015.","asker":"972","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[45240\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is in a position to provide any further capital funding between now and 2016 to advance the N2 section of the N2 A5 project, in particular that section of the project situated between Clontibret and Moy Bridge in County Monaghan.","asker":"972","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[45136\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800046#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will put in place a time frame to release funds as soon as possible for the continuation of works on the A5 which is now costing considerable amounts everyday due to it being held up.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos.19, 28 and\u00a071 together.<\/p><p>  These questions relate to the N2 in the Republic of Ireland,\u00a0in particular the section from\u00a0Clontibret to the\u00a0Northern Irish Border\u00a0and\u00a0the A5 in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware,\u00a0the previous Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5 in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 However, they made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post-2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.\u00a0 Given that STG&pound;400 million sterling was due to fall between 2013 and 2016 and given the current state of the Exchequer, it was not feasible to provide this level of funding in the coming years. <\/p><p>  Therefore, at the NSMC Plenary meeting, on 8th November 2011, Ministers\u00a0noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide STG&pound;25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.\u00a0 At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.\u00a0 In addition, it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.\u00a0 The NSMC plenary approved a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the STG&pound;50m committed by the Irish Government.  The implementation of the project is a matter for the Northern Ireland Road Service.  With regard to the N2 from Clontibret to the Border\u00a0section of the road, this is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. <\/p><p>  Given budgetary constraints the NRA will have to operate within the allocations set in the capital expenditure framework for the period to 2016.\u00a0 Within its capital allocation, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.\u00a0 Unfortunately funding limits mean that the Authority will not be in a position to progress a range of projects over the next number of years.  In the case of this scheme, I understand\u00a0that it\u00a0is intended to\u00a0bring\u00a0to\u00a0completion the\u00a0Route Selection Phase later this year.  However, due to the reduced funding available to the Authority under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2012-2016, the Authority intends to suspend the scheme once the Route Selection Phase is completed.

In order to better inform\u00a0our understanding of the drug driving problem and the options available to tackle it, I asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, earlier this year,\u00a0to undertake a study on roadside drug testing and related matters.\u00a0 The associated report and its recommendations were published yesterday (17 October).<\/p><p>  One of the main objectives of the\u00a0study\u00a0was to determine whether there are currently available any\u00a0suitable\u00a0devices, similar to breathalysers, that can detect and measure the level of drugs in a driver&rsquo;s system.\u00a0 The Bureau has advised that, while research in the area is continuing, oral fluid is emerging as the specimen of choice for use in roadside chemical drug testing devices.\u00a0 As a result, I have approved the establishment of a Working Group to consider the issues associated with introducing such devices.\u00a0 I am advised that, while there is now the potential for a suitable roadside device to be used for the testing of a number of commonly used drugs, there is still no device available for the testing of all drugs.<\/p><p>  In advance of any technological measures, I also propose to\u00a0introduce impairment testing for use\u00a0by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in determining whether a driver is incapable,\u00a0from intoxication,\u00a0of having proper control of\u00a0a vehicle.\u00a0 This testing will consist of simple, physical, cognitive tests such as walking a straight line, tipping one&rsquo;s nose or\u00a0counting while standing on one leg.\u00a0 In order to\u00a0implement this measure, I\u00a0intend amending a previously uncommenced provision\u00a0of the 2010 Road Traffic Act for inclusion in\u00a0the next Road Traffic Bill currently being prepared by my Department.<\/p><p>  I will examine all the recommendations arising from the Bureau's study and\u00a0will\u00a0support\u00a0any measures aiming to enhance the detection and deterrence of drug driving in this country.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800047#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Issues","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800047#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[45118\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800047#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the steps he is taking to deal with the fact that cuts to staffing and financial resources in the public sector will have a negative impact on tourism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>In keeping with the reforms and economies that are taking place across the public sector,\u00a0the tourism agencies\u00a0have\u00a0reconfigured\u00a0and prioritised the\u00a0services\u00a0they provide\u00a0in order to ensure that the core services required of the tourism sector are delivered.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  Over the last year,\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland has merged with Dublin Tourism and is pursuing a merger with the tourism arm of Shannon Development.

The study expected a downward trend in revenue from households and private companies (sponsorships, donations) in the short term, and a strong decrease in national budgets for sport.\u00a0 Because of this downward trend it is important that we create the environment which enables sport to generate its own revenues while at the same time funding sport to the appropriate level that the prevailing economic conditions allow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800048#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbour Authorities","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800048#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[45199\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800048#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"regarding the overpayment of expenses to a person (details supplied) by the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company, if he will confirm the amount the person was overpaid and if this money has been returned to the Harbour Company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>I have previously responded to questions from the deputy on this matter,\u00a0on 12 January 2012 and\u00a0on 14 December and 29 September 2011.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that the Company\u00a0arranged for an external\u00a0audit of various allegations published in the national press, including that of alleged overpayment of expenses, and that this review found those allegations were\u00a0false.

However, I also recognise that moderate and responsible alcohol consumption is not harmful and that there is no case for de normalising alcohol consumption it in the way that was appropriate for tobacco. Any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate, and should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur.<\/p><p>  A legislative ban\u00a0on sponsorship would have negative consequences for sport and tourism.\u00a0\u00a0There are huge economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport. \u00a0From a health perspective alone, there are clearly\u00a0significant benefits for individuals and for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport. One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.\u00a0 However, it is important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.<\/p><p>  Also, it is my view\u00a0that sport plays an important role in diverting young people away from alcohol. The financial support provided through sponsorship is integral to the availability of sport at grassroots level and I am concerned that placing constraints on the sporting organisations by eliminating the\u00a0alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have a negative impact on the development and availability of sport, particularly in the current economic climate.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the\u00a0major sporting events in which Irish teams compete\u00a0are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the state\u00a0by foreign broadcasters. Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisation from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway.

A shorter qualifying period for such individuals could leave the Revenue Job Assist scheme open to abuse with no real new job creation element being provided. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Black Economy Issues","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[45442\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the actions he has taken to stop persons working in the black economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[45444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money lost to the State each year due to the black economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[45445\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money he has saved by taking a tough stance on persons working in the black economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 97 and 98 together. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very mindful of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations.  Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.<\/p><p>  I am further advised that Revenue tackles the problem of people working in the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units.<\/p><p>  Revenue also has a particular focus on tackling evasion of taxes and duties in the oil and tobacco sectors.  In 2012 to date nine oil laundries have been detected, thirty-eight filling stations have been closed down and over one hundred and fifty-six thousand litres of fuel have been seized from oil laundries.  During 2011 Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 109 million cigarettes in 10,581 seizures.  Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4 million cigarettes.  Revenue also seized 11,158kg of tobacco in 2011.<\/p><p>  Regarding the amount of money lost to the State each year due to the shadow economy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that given the nature of the shadow economy there is no reliable system to measure the tax lost.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme, which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms.  For the year 2011, the Revenue Commissioners secured &euro;440m in additional yield through their audit programmes.  This additional yield includes a significant amount in respect of interest and penalties.  In addition, through its programme of assurance checks for 2011, the Commissioners secured additional yield of &euro;81m.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses.  The following is a summary of the audit results for the year 2011 for a number of sectors:<\/p><p> - Specific hospitality businesses (bars and restaurants) - 613 audits - Yield &euro;16.9m<\/p><p> - Professionals (White Collar) &ndash; 543 audits - &euro;14.5m yield<\/p><p> - Rental &ndash; 908 audits - &euro;35.1m yield.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting the shadow economy.  Two notable examples are the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalties regime for employers who fail to operate the PAYE regulations fully, both of which came into operation during 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02350"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[45443\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to support and encourage legitimate tax paying businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>I am well aware of the challenges facing all businesses in the current economic climate.  My Department is just one of many who are working to support and encourage business in Ireland, and the following are some examples of how this is being done.  Access to credit is widely regarded as one of the biggest challenges facing businesses in Ireland at present.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks achieved their 2011 targets and I would be confident of them achieving the more challenging target this year.  In terms of rejection rates from banks, the Credit Review Office (&lsquo;CRO&rsquo;) can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000.  The CRO is overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them.<\/p><p>  My Department also introduced the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act this year and the fund commenced business on 1st October.  This provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &euro;40 million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &euro;150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for small and medium enterprises who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  <\/p><p>  Further, the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation have taken the lead on a number of measures, including the transposition of Directive 2011\/7\/EC which has the purpose of establishing a clear legal obligation regarding the timing of payments from debtors.  This mechanism is to improve cashflow for businesses and is deemed to be particularly useful for small businesses.<\/p><p>  Aside from incentives to support and encourage businesses, there are a number of measures in place to ensure tax compliance for all businesses.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focused on ensuring tax compliance.  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax evasion.<\/p><p>  In terms of upcoming plans, it is not appropriate to discuss any measures which could form part of Budget 2013, but all of theses issues will feed into our considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800053#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":241,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 97 and 98 answered with Question No. 95.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[45472\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are any tax reliefs available for a person paying the nursing home fee contribution for their spouse who is in a nursing home under the fair deal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of health expenses in the provision of health care incurred by an individual or an individual&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, on their own behalf or on behalf of someone else.  Any contribution made by an individual in defraying nursing home expenses on behalf of an individual, where that individual has received State support under section 3 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, otherwise known as the &ldquo;Fair Deal Scheme&rdquo;, is treated as health expenses qualifying for relief.  This relief is given at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax.  The State support contribution towards the cost of such nursing home expenses under this scheme is not treated as a qualifying expense.

In addition, we will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income.  There are no plans at this time to depart from this policy.  I should point out that the top marginal rate of taxation on income is now 52% for PAYE workers and 55% for the self-employed.  The latest OECD data indicates that Ireland has the most progressive tax system of the EU members of its organisation.  A progressive taxation system ensures the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.  It is estimated that in 2012, the top 5% of income earners will pay 43% of the total income tax, while it is estimated that those earning &euro;50,000 or less, representing 78% of income earners, will pay 20% of the total income tax.  Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2012, 841,100 individuals, representing 39% of the income tax base, will be exempt from income tax.  When marginal rates of tax are very high, jobs are lost.  Indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on employment.  That is why indirect taxes rather than taxes on income were increased in the last budget.  However, that does not mean the wealthy should not carry the principal burden of tax.  The minimum effective tax restriction on high earners is designed to ensure this by imposing a minimum effective income tax rate of 30% for those subject to the full restriction, in addition to 4% in PRSI and up to 10% in the USC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[45484\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on estimated tax revenue (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>As I have stated recently to the Deputy, the estimated full-year costs and-or yields of the tax revenue measures introduced in Budget 2012 are set out on pages B5 to B11 of the Summary of 2012 Budget and Estimates Measures Policy Changes section of the budget 2012 book.

However, RCT applies to all construction works ranging from major construction projects to general repair works.  Repair work includes the replacement of constituent parts of a building or structure, for example, the repair of a broken window.  Maintenance, on the other hand, includes cleaning, removal of graffiti and the unblocking of drains, etc.  In the light of the difficulty some school boards of management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT system, the Revenue Commissioners have made available detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for boards of management regarding the operation of RCT.  These guidance notes, which clarify the position in relation to repair work and maintenance work, have been published on the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i>.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school boards of management and other principal contractors.  RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to introduce a threshold for this type of work.  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper-free system.  This has significantly reduced the administrative burden associated with RCT.  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT system is implemented correctly to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector, particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school boards of management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[45574\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has an estimate of the amount of money that would be raised in a full year if the remittance basis of taxation for persons who are tax resident in Ireland but are not Irish domiciled.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is asking about the yield from the removal from tax law of what is known as the remittance basis of taxation, which applies to certain foreign income and gains of those who are tax resident but not domiciled in the State.

The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation\/decision.  The Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably this has had the unfortunate consequence of increasing the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the Tribunal.<\/p><p>  Despite the significant increase in the volume of claims, the Tribunal has been pro-active in seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases, of similar types where possible or where the parties are the same.  These efficiencies have resulted in quicker turnover and improvements to the service provided and delivered significant increases in output and the number of cases disposed of, in 2010 (+30%), 2011 (+11%) and a further marked increase to date in 2012.  The number of claims awaiting hearing at the end of Q3 2012 is 4,311. There has been a continued reduction in the number of claims awaiting hearing since Q1 2011. However, of the total number of claims received by the Tribunal, approximately 25% to 35% of these claims are Unfair Dismissal claims.  Due to the contested nature of unfair dismissal cases, a very significant but varying amount of the Tribunal&#8217;s time is given to these hearings.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available.<\/p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.<\/p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.<\/p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.<\/p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill. <\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date which means we now have:<blockquote>- A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.<br \/><br \/>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<br \/><br \/>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months<br \/><br \/>- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<br \/><br \/>- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<br \/><br \/>- A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.<br \/><br \/>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.<\/blockquote>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[45519\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when he will introduce legislation on the changes in responsibility for Shannon Development and the way it is expected that the change will affect the promotion and use of lands in County Limerick that are currently in the ownership of Shannon Development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, in principle last May, to separate Shannon Airport from the DAA and bring it together with a restructured Shannon Development to create a new Shannon entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership.

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) was established to ensure that Ireland meets its EU and IEA oil stockholding obligations.  In 2012, under IEA methodology, NORA is required to hold 75 days of Ireland&#8217;s 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.<\/p><p><br \/>  NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and stock &#8220;tickets&#8221; (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of an oil supply disruption).<\/p><p><br \/>  Of the stocks currently held by NORA, approximately 66% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 33% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 2% are held as stock tickets.<\/p><p><br \/>  All industry stocks are held as physical stocks within the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is Government policy to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  In 2011, NORA commissioned two new storage facilities at Ringsend, in Dublin and Kilroot, in County Antrim.  In addition, the refurbishment of an existing facility at Tarbert Power Station, County Kerry is at an advanced stage.  This additional storage capacity will considerably enhance oil security on the Island of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The costs of maintaining the strategic stocks held by NORA are outlined in the NORA annual financial statements, which are published on the website .  The costs vary from year to year depending on the obligation level set for NORA which in turn depends upon the level of oil consumption in the State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and its operations are funded by a levy imposed on the disposal of oil products which is currently 2 cents per litre and by borrowings from commercial banks.  The levy rate is reviewed from time to time and was increased from 1 cent per litre to the current rate of 2 cents per litre with effect from October, 2009.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.<\/p><p>  With regard to gas, up until 1 October 2011 the CER has regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.<\/p><p>  For Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s residential tariffs, the allowed revenue is examined twice yearly.  These examinations set the BG Energy tariffs for the following six months of the gas year.  To set the prices that BG Energy may charge customers, the CER first determines the revenue that BG Energy needs to earn to meet costs efficiently.  These costs include the cost of buying wholesale gas, transportation, BG Energy's own supply cost, profit margin and capital expenditure.  The most recent Gas Tariff Review (CER\/12\/146) was published on 4 September 2012.<\/p><p>  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. Ireland is however a price taker for gas.<\/p><p>  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is charged to all electricity customers.  It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat) and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, as set out in legislation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup, inter alia, the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation producing, a proportion of their electricity from such generators.<\/p><p>  Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 sets out the legal basis for the PSO levy in Ireland.  Statutory Instrument No. 217 of 2002 made under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act requires that the CER calculates and certifies the costs associated with the PSO and sets the associated levy for the required period.  The PSO levy takes into account the estimated and actual costs incurred in undertaking generation activities which are covered in the relevant PSO legislation. Articles 8 and 9 of Statutory Instrument 217 of 2002 set out the methodology of the calculation of the components of the PSO levy and the estimation of the amount of the PSO levy by the CER.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[45491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the Memorandum for Understanding agreed with the Troika includes provision for the establishment of certain larger retailers here.","asker":"1034","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>The <i>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Retail Planning<\/i> and accompanying <i>Retail Design Manual<\/i> which I published on 1 May 2012 are aimed at: <\/p><p>- ensuring that the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector;   <\/p><p>- advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres; and,<\/p><p>- contributing to a high standard of urban design and encouraging a greater use of sustainable transport. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Guidelines take into account the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s study : <i>Review of the Economic Impact of the Retail Cap<\/i> which is an evidence-based and focused study to analyse the potential economic impacts of eliminating the cap on the size of retail premises and is published on my Department&#8217;s website at .<\/p><p><br \/>   This study was prepared in response to the requirement in the <i>EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland<\/i> for an economic analysis of the potential impact on competition and consumer prices of eliminating or relaxing the floorspace cap on retail premises . <\/p><p><br \/>  On foot of the Forf&aacute;s study , and the public consultation process on the draft Guidelines, the convenience retail floorspace caps were amended rather than eliminated and proposed exceptions to the 6,000 square metres retail warehouse cap may be considered on the merits of individual development applications in the five National Spatial Strategy Gateway cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick\/Shannon and Galway subject to the locational criteria set out in the Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Installation","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[45395\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800054#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the installation of water meters is going to begin for the initial trial and nationwide; the installers of the meters; the way in which one may apply for a job regarding the installation of the meters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>The Government has decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.\u00a0 In addition, the Government has recently approved the preparation of legislation to assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.\u00a0 The objective is to have the Bill enacted by the end of this year.

The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation\/decision.  The Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably this has had the unfortunate consequence of increasing the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the Tribunal.<\/p><p>  Despite the significant increase in the volume of claims, the Tribunal has been pro-active in seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases, of similar types where possible or where the parties are the same.  These efficiencies have resulted in quicker turnover and improvements to the service provided and delivered significant increases in output and the number of cases disposed of, in 2010 (+30%), 2011 (+11%) and a further marked increase to date in 2012.  The number of claims awaiting hearing at the end of Q3 2012 is 4,311. There has been a continued reduction in the number of claims awaiting hearing since Q1 2011. However, of the total number of claims received by the Tribunal, approximately 25% to 35% of these claims are Unfair Dismissal claims.  Due to the contested nature of unfair dismissal cases, a very significant but varying amount of the Tribunal&#8217;s time is given to these hearings.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available.<\/p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.<\/p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.<\/p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.<\/p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill. <\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date which means we now have:<blockquote>- A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.<br \/><br \/>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<br \/><br \/>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months<br \/><br \/>- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<br \/><br \/>- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<br \/><br \/>- A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.<br \/><br \/>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.<\/blockquote>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800060#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":826,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800060#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":827,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[45519\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800060#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when he will introduce legislation on the changes in responsibility for Shannon Development and the way it is expected that the change will affect the promotion and use of lands in County Limerick that are currently in the ownership of Shannon Development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":828,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, in principle last May, to separate Shannon Airport from the DAA and bring it together with a restructured Shannon Development to create a new Shannon entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership.

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) was established to ensure that Ireland meets its EU and IEA oil stockholding obligations.  In 2012, under IEA methodology, NORA is required to hold 75 days of Ireland&#8217;s 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.<\/p><p><br \/>  NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and stock &#8220;tickets&#8221; (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of an oil supply disruption).<\/p><p><br \/>  Of the stocks currently held by NORA, approximately 66% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 33% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 2% are held as stock tickets.<\/p><p><br \/>  All industry stocks are held as physical stocks within the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is Government policy to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  In 2011, NORA commissioned two new storage facilities at Ringsend, in Dublin and Kilroot, in County Antrim.  In addition, the refurbishment of an existing facility at Tarbert Power Station, County Kerry is at an advanced stage.  This additional storage capacity will considerably enhance oil security on the Island of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The costs of maintaining the strategic stocks held by NORA are outlined in the NORA annual financial statements, which are published on the website .  The costs vary from year to year depending on the obligation level set for NORA which in turn depends upon the level of oil consumption in the State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and its operations are funded by a levy imposed on the disposal of oil products which is currently 2 cents per litre and by borrowings from commercial banks.  The levy rate is reviewed from time to time and was increased from 1 cent per litre to the current rate of 2 cents per litre with effect from October, 2009.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.<\/p><p>  With regard to gas, up until 1 October 2011 the CER has regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.<\/p><p>  For Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s residential tariffs, the allowed revenue is examined twice yearly.  These examinations set the BG Energy tariffs for the following six months of the gas year.  To set the prices that BG Energy may charge customers, the CER first determines the revenue that BG Energy needs to earn to meet costs efficiently.  These costs include the cost of buying wholesale gas, transportation, BG Energy's own supply cost, profit margin and capital expenditure.  The most recent Gas Tariff Review (CER\/12\/146) was published on 4 September 2012.<\/p><p>  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. Ireland is however a price taker for gas.<\/p><p>  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is charged to all electricity customers.  It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat) and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, as set out in legislation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup, inter alia, the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation producing, a proportion of their electricity from such generators.<\/p><p>  Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 sets out the legal basis for the PSO levy in Ireland.  Statutory Instrument No. 217 of 2002 made under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act requires that the CER calculates and certifies the costs associated with the PSO and sets the associated levy for the required period.  The PSO levy takes into account the estimated and actual costs incurred in undertaking generation activities which are covered in the relevant PSO legislation. Articles 8 and 9 of Statutory Instrument 217 of 2002 set out the methodology of the calculation of the components of the PSO levy and the estimation of the amount of the PSO levy by the CER.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[45491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the Memorandum for Understanding agreed with the Troika includes provision for the establishment of certain larger retailers here.","asker":"1034","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>The <i>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Retail Planning<\/i> and accompanying <i>Retail Design Manual<\/i> which I published on 1 May 2012 are aimed at: <\/p><p>- ensuring that the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector;   <\/p><p>- advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres; and,<\/p><p>- contributing to a high standard of urban design and encouraging a greater use of sustainable transport. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Guidelines take into account the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s study : <i>Review of the Economic Impact of the Retail Cap<\/i> which is an evidence-based and focused study to analyse the potential economic impacts of eliminating the cap on the size of retail premises and is published on my Department&#8217;s website at .<\/p><p><br \/>   This study was prepared in response to the requirement in the <i>EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland<\/i> for an economic analysis of the potential impact on competition and consumer prices of eliminating or relaxing the floorspace cap on retail premises . <\/p><p><br \/>  On foot of the Forf&aacute;s study , and the public consultation process on the draft Guidelines, the convenience retail floorspace caps were amended rather than eliminated and proposed exceptions to the 6,000 square metres retail warehouse cap may be considered on the merits of individual development applications in the five National Spatial Strategy Gateway cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick\/Shannon and Galway subject to the locational criteria set out in the Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Installation","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[45395\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101800062#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the installation of water meters is going to begin for the initial trial and nationwide; the installers of the meters; the way in which one may apply for a job regarding the installation of the meters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":889,"content":"<p>The Government has decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.\u00a0 In addition, the Government has recently approved the preparation of legislation to assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.\u00a0 The objective is to have the Bill enacted by the end of this year.
