The committee is still awaiting extensive information in respect of the untruths we were told by the seven members of the delegation that we met in May this year.  We asked at our meeting with the Secretary General that he provide us with a line-by-line rebuttal of what he sees as the inaccuracies or untruths in those statements, but we have not received that to date.  That is disappointing, because we emphasised that leaving what he said on the public record is unsatisfactory.

The financial statements recognise the pension liabilities that arise in relation to the staff of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  They also recognise a deferred funding asset, a matching asset, in relation to two of the schemes - the closed schemes - which were previously funded schemes.  If the Chairman recalls, around 2009 there was legislation to transfer the funds in the funded schemes to the Exchequer.  As a result, there is a statutory guarantee that the liabilities in relation to those schemes will be met.  They are recognising a matching asset in relation to that, but those schemes are closed.  More recent staff are in what one calls a pay-as-you-go pension scheme.  There is not a similar statutory guarantee in relation to the payment of pensions in that case.  With most public sector bodies, where they are accounting for pension liabilities, there is a practice that they recognise a matching asset in the expectation that the State will honour the liabilities as they arise in the future.

Again, there have been delays.  There were difficulties in getting the audit completed and in presenting the opinion I have drawn attention to a number of matters.  The first is that deficits have been incurred by the institute for a number of consecutive years so there is a funding difficulty there.  Second, there were a number of governance issues.  The review of the effectiveness of the system of controls was not carried out in respect of the year ended 31 August 2013, and also the institute's audit committee did not issue an annual report, which would normally be expected in respect of the 2012 to 2013 year.  It was unable to do that until September 2014 because of concerns it had about the timely provision of key information to allow the institute to present the report.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question of expenditure to a value of &euro;524,000, which was identified, where procurement rules were not complied with.  The final point relates to the restructuring and consolidation of the results of the companies that were established to provide campus services.  That resulted in the financial statements for 2012 to 2013 being based on draft financial results only for those companies.  The audits had not been completed.  I understand now that the companies have become part of the Waterford Institute of Technology group and that for the year 2013 to 2014 they will be consolidating the results, so that will allow us to get a clearer picture of what is the financial situation in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#C02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>All right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#C02400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Representatives of the HEA are in today.

I know the HEA will probably not have the answers that we are requesting today, but is there some mechanism we can use as a committee to deal with the allegations raised in the media about the University of Limerick?  Staff were allegedly offered upwards of &euro;60,000 to leave the university on foot of allegations that were being made.  Regardless of whether they are true, those allegations have caused a lot of concern in respect of the University of Limerick.  It goes back to what Deputy Dowds said.

After that, I agree with him that there is a need to follow through on some of the issues that have been raised with the agencies about which he speaks to determine what action has been taken, what remedies have been put in place and so on.  Perhaps we need to have a general review of some of the issues that were raised and the recommendations we made, see what progress was made on each of them and then report back to the committee.<\/p> <p>  We will move on to St. James's Hospital.  Before the Comptroller and Auditor General comments, the last time this matter came to light through the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit was in respect of the HSE itself, where &euro;9 million had to be set aside to deal with compensation arising from late payment of accounts.<\/p><p>It appears that in this case, which is to do with St. James's Hospital, an additional &euro;389,000 was charged to the income account to recognise the expected cost of compensation due to suppliers since the introduction of the legislation in 2013.  In the Beaumont accounts, there is a further &euro;200,000 in interest and compensation.  Someone needs to get to grips with the management of the Health Service Executive, HSE, because the level of incompetence I see at these committee hearings is such that no private business could be conducted in the manner in which the executive conducts its business.  This has nothing to do with the front-line services but pertains to middle management up to the senior levels.  Action must be taken regarding the HSE and some structure must be put in place to transform it into a meaningful organisation that recognises the legislation Members pass in this House.  My understanding of the &euro;9 million that had to be set aside by the HSE for compensation with regard to late payments to small businesses that supplied it was it was necessary for the Comptroller and Auditor General to prove to the HSE that it was in breach of legislation.  If the executive does not understand legislation, I wonder what kind of management team it has.  Members can now see the same issues arising in St. James's and Beaumont hospitals and this goes back to the concerns expressed regarding the educational sector.  What sanctions can be taken against organisations like that, which appear to disregard legislation or, even worse, have no knowledge of the legislation?  Private businesses are expected to have that knowledge and in this case, the suppliers to the HSE, which presumably are small businesses, all are being penalised by the late payments being made by the HSE and now by the hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#D02000","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443085200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I might just inform the committee that next week, in the report on the accounts of the public services for 2014, I will have a chapter which deals with this issue across the HSE and in the two hospitals that I audit.

That is a system failure but behind a system failure, is there not a person, an individual or a manager?  Therefore, it is not a system failure but a failure of management.  I refer to when one has a manager who understands the procurement process - and Mr. Watt constantly explains to the committee through his Department how significant it is and how much in savings can be made from the new procurement processes - yet it oversees an agency such as the HSE that is squandering money and is ignoring procurement processes and nobody appears to take action to stop it.  In this collection of accounts before the committee this morning, because there are so many of them, members can see poor value for taxpayers' money, systems being abandoned and procurement by and large being abandoned.  They can see a huge amount of money being wasted in the education sector.  They see agencies that now are providing the committee with accounts over a four-year period.  Another agency that is providing accounts over a four-year period is, I believe, the one responsible for the development of a technical university in Dublin.  How competent are they or what is going wrong that those who are in charge are not doing their jobs to ensure there is value for money and the systems that are in place work?  The question for the Committee of Public Accounts and for Mr. McCarthy's own office is, having highlighted these issues, how far we can go to ensure proper governance of the State's expenditure is put in place and is properly policed.  Incidentally, it should be stated that in all those cases, no one will lose his or her job.  No sanction will be taken against any individual who has breached any of this stuff and we never hear of a case in which it was Mr. or Mrs. so-and-so who bypassed the regulations, did not do it properly and who has been sanctioned.  They would be, were this in the private sector, but the only sanction I have ever seen here is one gets promoted when something happens or one is sidelined into the grey area but no sanction is taken against one.

Public officials should be held to account if they are in breach of the code of practice or the rules of compliance.  In the case of the 1930 legislation, they are now compulsorily bound in respect of compensation.  There is &euro;9 million from the HSE in silent compensation alone, not to mention the individual amounts paid by hospitals and so on.  That issue of no sanction arises again and again.  On the other side of the equation is the impact on suppliers.  They are the lifeblood of the economy and if they are not paid, how will they remain in existence?  There is a double whammy: the fact that public money is being misspent and that there is an adverse effect on the economy.  It is something we have to get to grips with and have some direct mechanism for stamping it out.  The sooner we get that report on procurement and develop an overall policy that has teeth in terms of sanctions, the better.

In the interests of the public good, somebody needs to examine the policy of these reports and whether an independent pair of eyes should be allowed to make the decision as to whether they are published and what material should or should not be redacted.  Then we will have accountability.<\/p> <p>  Some of these Government agencies and entities do it as a matter of course when a really hard-hitting and serious issue arises with regard to bad decisions at management level.  They commission these reports and satisfy themselves that they have done their job and considered it after the fact and these reports never see the light of day.  I do not know if the Minister for Health, the Secretary General or senior officials in the Department obtain sight of the HSE reports.  At this point, it is a step that should be considered because I do not think the public is well served or that there is value for money with regard to the money spent on these reports, particularly when one considers the serious issues with which they deal.<\/p> <p>  It is a recurring theme.  Deputy Costello asked what do we do policy wise.  That is a step we should consider and see what step we can take with regard to the commissioning of these reports and their ultimate publication, and whether the public is getting value for money with regard to what is being spent on these reports.  Considering the serious issues we have dealt with here in the past year, it is a reasonable step to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#F00800","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Is that across every Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#F00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>We should start with the HSE.

My suspicion is that in some cases they are not published to protect individuals within those agencies, the decisions they took or the inaction within those organisations.

It is the primary funding authority for the universities, teacher training colleges, institutes of technology and a number of other designated education bodies.  The HEA dispersed over &euro;1.1 billion in grants in 2014.  The majority of its income comes directly from Vote 26 - Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  I have issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2014 financial statements.  However, as in previous years, the audit certificate draws attention to the HEA's practice of funding certain universities for notional employer pension contributions in respect of members of pay-as-you-go pension schemes.  As a result, they are funded approximately 15% above the level actually required to pay the related staff members.  The HEA allows those universities to retain both the notional employer and actual employee pension contributions and to account for them in what are called pension control accounts.  The accumulated funds are recognised in the university accounts as sums due to the HEA.  The balances held in the five universities concerned in respect of pay-as-you-go model pension schemes stood at &euro;159 million at 30 September 2014, up from &euro;125 million at end-September 2013.  <\/p> <p>  The universities also record amounts due from the HEA in relation to pension payments already made under separate, closed pension schemes.  The result has been net underfunding for pension expenditure in some universities and net overfunding in others.  When we raised this matter first in 2012, the HEA stated that the pension control accounts mechanism was a short-term one.  I understand that steps are now being taken to bring the pension funding more into line with expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Apart from providing funding for the third level sector, the HEA carries out an oversight and regulatory role in respect of higher education institutions.  My office is currently undertaking an examination of that function.  At a high level, the examination is considering the role and responsibilities of the HEA with regard to governance in the sector and the adequacy of systems it has put in place to achieve its objectives.  Progress on that examination has been delayed by an unavoidable change in personnel on the examination team but I hope to finalise the report on the examination early in 2016.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology financial statements for 2012-2013.  The consolidated income and expenditure account for Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology shows an operating deficit of almost &euro;1.3 million for the year ended 31 August 2013, compared to a deficit of &euro;200,000 in the previous year.  The Institute&rsquo;s income for the 2012-2013 financial year was &euro;56.2 million, with the largest amount, &euro;25.3 million, coming in the form of grants from the HEA.  A further &euro;19.2 million related to tuition fees, including student contributions.  Other significant sources of income include research grants of &euro;2.4 million and retained employee pension contributions of &euro;2.2 million.  Since institute of technology pensions are paid centrally, the latter is, effectively, a further state grant.  The Institute incurred expenditure of &euro;57.6 million in the year, with staff pay costs accounting for nearly &euro;42 million, or 72% of the total.  The institute&rsquo;s financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2013 received an unqualified audit opinion.  However, the audit certificate draws attention to a disclosure in the accounts concerning the high costs of an investigation into the manner in which the institute dealt with a case of plagiarism that occurred in 2009.  At 31 August 2013, the aggregate cost of the investigation stood at &euro;436,000, of which nearly &euro;187,000 had been incurred in the year of account.<\/p> <p>  Issues around the process for consideration of a proposal to establish a technological university for the south east through a merger of Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology have arisen at committee meetings on a number of occasions.  Progress on the proposed merger is reviewed by my office each year in the context of the audit of the financial statements of the two institutes.  I have no observation to make at this time on the report that is before the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443085200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make this opening statement regarding the investigation of plagiarism at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the establishment of a technological university for the south east and the 2014 financial statements of the Higher Education Authority.  As requested, I have forwarded some advance briefing material to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Department first became aware of the investigation of plagiarism at GMIT in November 2013.  The detailed response on the investigation of plagiarism at GMIT is more appropriate for Mr. Jim Fennell, acting president of GMIT, to outline.  However, the Department&rsquo;s view is that while there are issues arising with how the investigation was managed during the process, the management response to the issues has, ultimately, been comprehensive.  Following consideration of the reports on the investigation of plagiarism in GMIT, the Higher Education Authority issued advice to the presidents of all HEA-funded higher education institutions in May 2015 on the matters to be considered in order to manage the costs of independent investigations.  Mr. Boland of the HEA will outline the advice provided. <\/p> <p>  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, published in January 2011, recommended the consolidation of the institute of technology sector and the creation of a small number of multi-campus technological universities.  The technological university, TU, for the south east project was initiated in 2011 and consists of a consortium of two institutes of technology - Carlow Institute of Technology, CIT, and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  The process for designation as a technological university consists of four stages and requires the merger of two or more institutes of technology prior to application for designation as a TU.  The four stages are set out in more detail in the briefing document supplied to the Committee.<\/p> <p>  The consortium for the technological university for the south east project made good progress initially and submitted a stage 1 expression of interest in 2012.  However, following this promising start, the consortium encountered a series of challenges and difficulties and did not succeed in finalising a stage 2 plan prior to the decision by WIT to suspend all merger activities in October 2014.  Following meetings with both institutes, in early November 2014, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the establishment of a new process of engagement and consultation with the governing bodies, staff and students of both institutes, together with the wider community in the south east, in order to articulate and develop the following: a shared vision for a technological university to serve the south-east region and to report to the Minister within ten weeks on the feasibility and steps required to progress an application for technological university status within an acceptable timeframe.  This is to be done having regard to the published criteria and process for designation as a technological university which is already in place. <\/p> <p>  The Minister appointed Mr. Michael Kelly to lead the process of consultation.  While a ten-week timeframe was initially set for the process to be completed, the timeframe to completion was extended due to a number of factors.  Due to other commitments of Mr. Kelly, a substantive start was not possible until early January 2015.  The intention then had been to complete by first quarter 2015 but, in light of progress made and an assessment that some further time would be beneficial to the outcome, the Minister&rsquo;s agreement to extend the time to completion by a further period was obtained.  The detailed response on the process itself and the contents of the report is more appropriate for Mr Kelly to outline.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that the process has been most beneficial in seeking to reinvigorate the project.  It has first and foremost confirmed that the project is viable.  In addition, it has also provided an opportunity to articulate for the first time the ambitions of regional stakeholders for a more vibrant regional performance in the future with a technological university as a core feature.  It has also set out a set of steps required to successfully reinvigorate the delivery of the project.  Mr. Kelly met the Minister for Education and Skills on 2 July 2015 and presented his report at that meeting.  The Minister subsequently met with the presidents and chairs of the two institutes on 21 July 2015 following noting of the report by Government.  The report was then published on 27 July 2015.<\/p> <p>  The focus is now on continuing the work progressed by Mr. Kelly and to assist with building mutual trust and respect between the two institutions.  In that regard, a preliminary engagement process is now underway between the two institutions, as recommended by Mr. Kelly.<\/p><p>I assure the committee that governance and accountability for the bodies under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, including the Higher Education Authority, are of paramount importance to the Department and that is why steps have been taken in recent months to strengthen even further the Department&rsquo;s role in the oversight of all institutions and bodies across the education sector.<\/p><p> Within the Department a committee on sectoral governance and accountability was established earlier this year and two meetings of the committee have been held since then.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to support the development and implementation of best practice governance arrangements across the sector through oversight and regular assessment of its approach to governance.  The committee&rsquo;s focus will include the non-commercial agencies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis, the higher education institutions as well as the education and training boards.  The committee&rsquo;s membership includes the chief executive of the HEA and an external member who can provide an additional element of insight and experience in the area of governance oversight.<\/p><p> A principal officers sectoral governance and accountability network has also been established.  Its role is to support the work of the management advisory committee sub-committee by facilitating discussion regarding compliance requirements, to provide feedback, highlighting issues arising in each sector and to disseminate best practice across the Department&rsquo;s bodies.  It has also been decided, in principle, to establish an internal audit sector forum for personnel with internal audit functions in the Department, its agencies, higher education institutes and ETBs.<\/p><p> In addition, as part of strengthening its role on governance and accountability oversight, the Department is tendering for the supply of services from suitably qualified companies for the purposes of conducting reviews of corporate governance compliance by education sector bodies with their relevant codes of practice which underpin their corporate governance frameworks.  The HEA is joining the Department in contracting this service in respect of bodies for which it has responsibility.<\/p><p> The HEA has also introduced a number of measures recently to enhance its role further in the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions under their remit.  The HEA is to brief the committee in more detail about these measures.  I want to mention in particular the meetings that have taken place in recent months between the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the institution&rsquo;s representative bodies which will assist, among other things, in providing an early flagging of any issues in the sector.  This new collaborative approach will assist all stakeholders across the sector in delivering a more robust system of governance and accountability in higher education.  The Department is committed to working closely with the HEA in achieving this aim.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the Department has been in correspondence in recent times with this committee on a number of issues particular to higher education.  In this regard, I assure the committee that the issues raised in the sector are, and continue to be, of great concern to the Department and we are working with the institutions, through the HEA, to seek to have the issues dealt with appropriately and as efficiently as possible.  I am happy to answer questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

The committee has also been provided with a detailed note setting out the HEA&rsquo;s interaction with GMIT in the case as well as with Quality and Qualifications Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the specific incident of plagiarism I wish to emphasise at the outset that the management of academic affairs, including course curricula, the marking of students and the handling of allegations of plagiarism is first a matter for individual higher education institutions.  The report prepared by Professor Bairbre Redmond found that the plagiarism detection, investigation and penalty procedures in place in GMIT at the time, in the main, were fit for purpose.  The HEA notes that since then the institute has made improvements in the policies in question.  The HEA&rsquo;s main area of concern relates to the costs incurred in the investigation carried out into the manner in which GMIT responded to and dealt with complaints of plagiarism.  Higher education institutions, like all public bodies, have a duty of care in the expenditure of Exchequer funding, especially as it relates to administrative processes.  Notwithstanding the importance of an independent investigation that was thorough and comprehensive in its remit, it is clear that there was failure on the part of GMIT in managing the costs and timelines of the investigation.  As we have emphasised to GMIT, it is especially unacceptable that such high costs were incurred in the context of a challenging financial situation in the higher education sector.<\/p> <p>  To avoid such incidents in the future, the HEA expects GMIT and other higher education institutions to inform us, the HEA, of major unexpected expenditure in a much more prompt manner.  Clearly the experience from this case in GMIT is salutary for the rest of the higher education sector.  Earlier this year the HEA wrote to all institutions under its remit on the subject of independent investigations and in particular the need to protect the independence of such investigations while at the same time having appropriate systems for cost control within the institution.  As part of revised governance reporting requirements introduced by the HEA in 2014, institutions are required to report on significant expenditure incurred from such investigations.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of a technological university for the south east, the HEA welcomes the publication of Mr. Michael Kelly&rsquo;s report to the Minister for Education and Skills on the engagement and consultation process on a technological university for the south east.  I will give the committee some background.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, published in January 2011, recommended the consolidation of the institutes of technology sector and the creation of a small number of multi-campus technological universities.  The process for designation as a technological university consists of four stages and requires the merger of two or more institutes of technology prior to application for designation as a TU.  The technological university for the south east project was initiated in 2011.  It made good progress initially and submitted a stage 1 expression of interest in 2012.  However, following this initial promising start, the consortium encountered a series of difficulties and did not succeed in finalising a stage 2 plan prior to the decision by Waterford Institute of Technology to suspend merger activities in October 2014.<\/p> <p>  In early November 2014, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, announced the establishment of a process of engagement and consultation with the governing bodies, staff and students of both institutes together with the wider community in the south east.  Mr. Michael Kelly was appointed to lead the process of consultation.  Mr. Kelly carried out a thorough consultation process in the region.  His reports set out the results of this consultation and of particular note are his observations that there is very significant convergence of thinking and approach by both institutions to many aspects of the design of a TU; if sufficient resolve exists within both institutions, the remaining issues should be capable of resolution; external stakeholders emphasised that any TU should support the economic and social development of the south east; and it is likely that the consortium of Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology would meet the quantitative TU designation criteria within a period of three years.  Mr Kelly also set out a number of options for the future, including the recommendation that a re-invigorated process to found a TU for the south east be established at the earliest feasible date, as well as the development of a facilitation process.  The HEA will continue to assist the two institutions to the greatest extent practicable.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of our financial statements, I am pleased to note that in his audit certificate accompanying the HEA&rsquo;s 2014 financial statements, the Comptroller and Auditor General records that the HEA has kept proper books of accounts and that the financial statements are in agreement with the books of accounts.  However, I draw attention to one issue.  Over recent years the Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to the issue of pension funding to the universities in the HEA&rsquo;s financial statements.  As our briefing paper sets out, the accumulated funds of approximately &euro;159 million referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s notes relate to the model pension schemes in the five older universities.  The model scheme membership has a much younger age profile compared with the closed funded schemes in the universities.  This means that the amount of employer and employee pension contributions going into the model scheme is much higher than pension and lump sum payments coming from it, resulting in a surplus.  The accumulated funds of &euro;159 million in the model scheme must be seen in tandem with a shortfall of approximately &euro;156.5 million that exists in respect of the closed funded schemes in the five older universities.  This shortfall has arisen due to an existing and increasing cohort of retirees in receipt of pensions and lump sums coupled with the fact that membership of the scheme itself has been closed to new entrants for some years now.  This means that the level of pension payments and lump sums greatly exceed any pension contributions from employer or employee, hence a shortfall in 2013-2014 of &euro;156.5 million.  Therefore, the accumulated funds of &euro;159 million in the model scheme must be offset against the accumulated shortfall of &euro;156.5 million in the closed funded schemes.  Although these figures represent an almost break-even position, it is anticipated that the accumulated shortfall in the closed funded schemes will continue to grow and will ultimately surpass any surplus on the model scheme.<\/p><p>The HEA remains in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to future funding requirements for the universities.  <\/p><p> In addition, I will be happy to update the committee on recent developments in governance and accountability in the higher education sector which includes strengthened and more rigorous requirements expected from institutions in terms of reporting on governance matters to the HEA as well as enhanced engagement and information sharing with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to the audits of financial statements in the higher education sector.  I am happy to take any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Boland.

The background to the plagiarism investigation is that an incident of suspected plagiarism by a student on a masters degree programme in the school of business was detected by a lecturer in November 2009.  The incident was determined by the school management to be one of minor plagiarism and, accordingly, the incident was considered by a school plagiarism committee in February 2010, which found the student guilty of plagiarism and imposed a penalty relating to the work submitted.  The student subsequently went on to graduate later that year.  In November and December 2010, reports relating to the incident appeared in the media alleging that a lecturer had assisted the student in the act of plagiarism and implying that the matter had been improperly handled and that the institute was engaging in a cover-up.<\/p> <p>  Following two internal reviews by the registrar and HR manager and following receipt of legal advice, I, as acting president and in consultation with the chairman, decided that an external investigation was required to safeguard the reputation of the institute and on 31 March 2011 informed the governing body accordingly.  On the advice of the institute&rsquo;s solicitors, Professor Bairbre Redmond, deputy registrar of UCD, was appointed to undertake the investigation.  Professor Redmond requested a second investigator be appointed and on the recommendation of Professor Redmond, Mr. Ed Madden, barrister-at-law, was appointed as co-investigator.  The terms of reference for the investigation were drawn up by the institute&rsquo;s legal advisers, agreed with the investigators and issued by the president on 13 June 2011.  A fixed fee of &euro;1,500 per day was agreed with each of the two investigators.  However, it was not envisaged that the investigation would require the level of input it did, resulting in costs of &euro;436,061 being incurred.  As the investigation progressed, concern was mounting at the increasing cost.  The president tried on a number of occasions to bring closure to the matter.  However, as the matters under investigation related to an alleged cover-up by the institute, it was important to protect the independence of the investigation and it was not appropriate for GMIT to influence the conduct of the investigation or to terminate it. <\/p> <p>  At a very late stage in the process, a significant disagreement occurred between the investigators regarding the compilation of the report, resulting in Professor Redmond stepping down as investigator.  Mr. Madden submitted a document which the president deemed as not satisfying the terms of reference.  Acting on legal advice, the president subsequently re-appointed Professor Redmond to provide the final report.  Additional legal and investigator costs were incurred in dealing with this aspect.  <\/p> <p>  The Redmond report, which issued in October 2013, concludes that the plagiarism detection, investigation and penalty procedures in place at the time of the incident were, in the main, fit for purpose.  The investigation also concludes that the issues associated with the management of the alleged incident of plagiarism under investigation were far less connected to a poorly constructed policy than to how these policies were interpreted and implemented.  A key conclusion arising from the investigation is that there was a failure on the part of a senior member of staff to provide relevant and significant information to the president and registrar of GMIT in February 2010 and in the period thereafter up to March 2011, regarding the involvement of a lecturer in procuring restricted material for a student. <\/p> <p>  A number of important lessons can be learnt from GMIT&rsquo;s experience of this process.  It appears such an investigation will inevitably become more complex and hence more costly than originally envisaged as new witnesses and material emerge during the course of the investigation.  Accordingly, particular consideration must be given in the terms of reference to allow provision for review of costs where the original plan cannot be achieved.  If appointing more than one investigator, one should be designated as the lead investigator.  Investigators should retain a direct reporting line to the president or nominee and be required to consult with the president in advance of taking any significant decisions impacting on the investigation. <\/p> <p>  I wish to apologise to all our stakeholders and, in particular, to our staff and students that such expenditure was incurred at a time when these costs can only be borne by reducing expenditure in areas which directly impact our staff and students.  I wish to assure this committee that the unethical behaviour which was the subject matter of this investigation is not representative of our staff whose commitment to high academic standards and professional integrity has enabled GMIT to contribute so much to the social and economic development of the region over the last five decades. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Fennell"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Fennell.

This is substantiated by the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We deal with the issue continually.  I believe that this is the committee's view.  There is a problem.  Citing the centralised procurement guidelines is no longer sufficient, given the regular infractions, particularly by a couple of large agencies.<\/p> <p>  In hindsight, does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; agree with the idea that &euro;1,500 per day was the going rate?

Those sorts of frameworks are the arrangements that should be put in place for investigations.  Now, every investigation depends on trying to get the right person to do the job.  A particular example is one of which this committee will be very aware.  I am not talking about costs in this regard.  When we carried out the investigation into WIT, we had to find the right individual for the job.  We would very lucky in employing Dermot Quigley to do that work.  There is an issue about the nature of the investigation and matching the expertise to it.  A call was made, which appears to have been an appropriate call, that this would be academically driven, in the first instance, because it was an academic inquiry.

I have listened to what the Chairman said.  We are concerned about the activities of institutions and agencies.  We have endeavoured to put in place much more effective frameworks.  We had frameworks in place and we have been seeking to improve them.  Within the Department, we are seeking to bring together the three groups we have - namely, the ETBs, the HEIs, with the HEA, and the national agencies - and to look at best practice.  The big way we can bring about change is in the context of the culture within the institutions.  This is reflected in the work the HEA is doing in organising briefing seminars on procurement and other issues for the finance officers and other people in the institutions entitled to do it.  Improved behaviour will not come about by centralised control, it come about through cultural change and an element of increased regulation and that is what we are seeking to put in place.  It is about in having an improved framework in place; not seeking to control every activity.  That is the balance that we have to take because neither the Department nor, indeed, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can seek to engage in that level of detail with each institution so we have new early warning mechanisms and improved liaison with the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  The list the committee has seen this morning reflects exactly what we do in the Department, the exception being that we are trying to get that list earlier, where there have been breakdowns, in order that we can intervene.  The HEA is following up on every matter with the higher education institution to which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers.  The HEA has quarterly meetings with the Comptroller and Auditor General so that if issues are emerging, it will hear about them.  There are different ways of proceeding but having departmental or HEA approval for every action of an institution is not one of them.

In response to more recent difficulties, we now also require the institutions to share generic issues that arise in their internal audit, whether that they are not adequately dealing with procurement or that there are issues with travelling and subsistence.  We are, therefore, requiring them to inform the sector as a whole of issues that arise in their internal audit so that a degree of learning is going on.  Very importantly, we have not done it yet, but we have signalled to the sector our intention to conduct, in co-ordination with the Department, what we describe as rolling reviews of various aspects of expenditure in the sector.  We have not officially informed the institutions of this, but I would like to see procurement as one of the first areas where we would do a system review of what is happening in the area and get professional people to take a system view of what is happening, in addition to the various levels of accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Who are the auditors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#S01300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443085200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Our auditors are the C&amp;AG, of course, but our internal auditors are-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#S01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443085200,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Mazars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#S01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stewart Roche"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443085200,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Mazars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#S01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Who would do the trend analysis?

I regard the technological university for the south east, TUSE, project as being of enormous significance for the future economic and social development of the south east region.  As such, I appreciate this opportunity.<\/p> <p>  As referred to by the Secretary General earlier, I was asked by the Minister for Education and Skills to lead this process, engaging with a broad range of stakeholders within the two institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford and more generally across the south east region.  Consistent with the terms of reference, the process focused on the development of a shared vision for the new technological university and identification of the practical steps required to bring it about within an acceptable timeframe.  I had the full co-operation, including administrative and logistical support, of both institutes and allocated a large proportion of my own working time to the project over the first half of 2015.   I also, of course, had the full support of the Department and the Higher Education Authority, for which I wish to express my thanks.  <\/p> <p>  Through the engagement I had with the many groups and individuals I met during the course of the project I learnt a great deal more about the challenges faced by the south east region and the potential of a new technological university to help address these challenges.  I was in a position to bring my experience from the Dublin consortium to bear on the project and my intention was to assess the overall rationale and viability of the TUSE in the first instance and to then map the practical steps I believed necessary to deliver it.  History will judge the accuracy of my assessment, but it is a source of some satisfaction that both institutes agreed to enter into the preliminary facilitation process I had recommended as a first step.  Based on my knowledge of both institutes, I have every confidence that with strong positive leadership they can surmount the challenges to be faced in agreeing a shared vision for the new institution, in developing a unified implementation plan and in taking the steps necessary to achieve TU designation within a timeframe that is broadly acceptable to the community across the south east.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that the report I prepared has been circulated to the committee and I will not dwell on its detailed content.  Rather, I believe there would be greater benefit in speaking about some of the issues that hindered progress in earlier phases and some of the critical success factors, as I see them, in ensuring a successful outcome for complex organisational development projects of this nature.  Any views I express are entirely my own.  The pathway to designation as a technological university is deliberately demanding of applicant institutes. This is justified on the grounds of clearly differentiating the new technological universities from existing institutes of technology and in protecting the Irish university brand internationally.  However, it imposes an additional set of pressures on the applicant institutes at every level and I believe there needs to be a greater willingness to support the additional activities involved and to recognise the complexities and additional workloads required.  In saying this, I am conscious that the Department and HEA are faced with many competing priorities and that the overall level of investment is of necessity limited.<\/p> <p>  Beyond this general point, the process of preparing the stage 2 business plan in the south east was complicated by a series of interruptions due to external factors, which made it difficult to develop and maintain momentum.  Some of the issues involved, relating to financial governance in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, also hardened attitudes around the need for robust due diligence exercises.  None of this was helpful in generating a mood of mutual trust, respect and confidence, which is the only foundation on which to build a truly committed collaborative venture.  More specifically, in paragraph 3.3 of my report I identify a number of learning points from the earlier phases of the south east project.  These should be brought to bear in thinking out the next stages and may also have wider application elsewhere.  They can be summarised as follows: the focus must be on an entirely new institution, offering to the region a new level of capability and regional reach rather than any extrapolation of existing institutes and offerings; the partners must find ways to rebuild mutual trust and respect as the basis for equality of esteem; they need to agree a shared vision and a framework which ensures all relevant issues are bottomed out and processed to an agreed conclusion; they need to acknowledge the value of diversity, building on their respective strengths while remaining open to new opportunities across the region; the project will need to be proactively supported financially, starting with the change management processes involved; and the framework adopted should make the needs and expectations of regional stakeholders central to the design and implementation processes.<\/p> <p>  Later in the report, in Chapter 7, I have identified a number of enabling and supportive measures which I believe can improve the prospects of success.  The backdrop to this section of the report is the evidence presented in a European University Association report on merger and concentration processes in European countries over the past 15 years.  That report is clear on a number of key findings: the wider benefits include increased quality, realisation of economic gains, system consolidation, strengthening of institutional positioning and geographic drivers; the transition period for newly merged institutions requires considerable set-up investment if the expected dividend in quality of outcomes is to be realised; and the pay-back period can be extensive.<\/p><p>Applying these principles in the Irish context, the primary goal must be to achieve a step-change in quality and outcomes, from what could be achieved by institutes of technology at a given level of investment to what should be achieved by technological universities benchmarked against the best internationally.  The policy framework rightly places emphasis on the achievement of demanding academic and institutional criteria.  The full value of doing so is unlikely to be realised if we do not match our quality aspirations with the level of set-up investment required and adjust the funding model for technological universities, TUs, based on a rigorous evaluation of their funding needs.  I would expect that there will be an opportunity for an informed dialogue between the various TU consortia and the HEA on these and related issues in due course. <\/p><p> Of course, the merging of institutions and the synergies from combining resources and capabilities will also present opportunities for efficiency gain and stronger capacity for generating new income streams.  These will need to be fully exploited in concentrating resources on the quality of the student experience, research excellence and other aspects of institutional mission in these new institutions.  This will also form a natural part of the dialogue on a new funding model for TUs.  While this entire discussion goes a little beyond my brief, which concerns the technological university for the south east, TUSE, I have taken the liberty of addressing the issue and have been clear in the report that this is the backdrop against which my recommendations were made. <\/p><p> The enabling and supportive measures I have proposed include: supportive structures, which are concerned with an appropriately constituted, independently chaired steering group; a joint project team combining skill sets from both institutes; and a new feature in the form of a regional stakeholder forum, which reflects the significance of the TUSE in addressing the real needs and expectations of the entire community in the south east.  The proposed measures also include support for facilitation and change management.  This would build on work already done and should involve a cross-campus, bottom-up engagement process across both institutes on the design of every facet of the new institution.  Also included are institution support and acceleration measures.  While these are not identified specifically, the case is made that, in a context where both institutes are constructively engaged on the design and execution of TUSE, sympathetic consideration should be given to further measures which would address potential obstacles or accelerate progress towards meeting designation criteria within an acceptable timeframe.  Finally, the point has already been made that if we want to realise the full value of developing the TU model in Ireland, we will need to rigorously assess its real funding needs. <\/p><p> If I could summarise, there is a strong policy rationale and business case for proceeding with the TUSE project, based primarily on the needs of the south-east region.  The project is feasible.  With a fair wind, the necessary planning and preparation should be achievable within three years, subject to validation of aggregate data on TU designation metrics and a total commitment by both institutes to get on with it   I have outlined the practical steps required.  Both institutes are already engaged in the first step recommended, through their ongoing participation in the current facilitation process. <\/p><p> I will be happy to address any questions within the limits of my competence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

Based on my close contact with both institutes over quite a protracted period earlier in the year, I am confident there is a strong belief in both academic communities, and indeed among the staff more generally, in the concept of a technological university and in the value of doing that in the south east.  Both institutes prepared very ambitious and well-informed vision statements setting out their stalls, as it were, as to how the TU might materialise.  Alongside that, there were also indications of real stresses in relationships between the two institutes at many levels.  There is a very strong rationale, therefore, for recommending a preliminary facilitation process in order to ventilate some of those problems from the past, to try and deal with them, to get them out of the way and to get on with the substantive business.  A very strong recommendation in my report was that nothing substantive should commence before going through that preliminary stage in a serious way.

There is a sense in the HEA that, in a way, this project was not given a full chance on its first outing and this is an opportunity to put it back on track, as has been said.

The building of trust between the institutions at leadership level and more widely is absolutely crucial - ultimately, to a successful outcome - and the institutions want the successful outcome of a technological university in due course.  For the reasons mentioned by the Deputy, we are the ultimate adjudicator of the process so I do not want to say anything to predict the outcome.  Our interest is to see this project progress well in the interests, first, of the region, as the case has been well made for the social and economic benefit that would come from technological university there, but also in the interest of the institutes.

Having served as a member of this committee for the past four years or so, I know we have received continual assurances that everything that could be done was being done from the HEA's standpoint, as well as that of the Department of Education and Skills.  Nevertheless, the process collapsed and we are back here again.  I suppose this is a question for Mr. Kelly.  Notwithstanding the fact that everyone agrees with his analysis on cause and his recommendations, is there a utility for a check in the system as it goes along to see if the process is working and those recommendations are being implemented properly?  That is where the problem is and has been in the past.  This was abruptly ended by an e-mail in October 2014 from WIT which indicated that was it, it was done.  My difficulty is I deal with officials in the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills who are trying to do their job but, frankly, the process did not work because they did not know what was going on.  Mr. Kelly repeatedly makes the point in his report that while people were collaborating on the face of it, when we scratched the surface there was very little going on in the form of substantive and progressive work towards the ultimate goal.  It was almost like a facade, and the process was self-serving.

With respect to the motives of the two institutes from the beginning of the process, I have no doubt that both entered this with enthusiasm and got on with what they felt had to be done in a conscientious way from the beginning.  The stage 1 report they prepared bears testament to that.  They then ran into difficulties and some of those were occasioned by what I term \"external events\"; they were external to this process and caused interruptions.  I can contrast my experience with the Dublin consortium with what I have observed retrospectively with respect to the south east.  In Dublin, from the beginning, the momentum flowed consistently, led very much by the three presidents in the colleges.  I chair the steering group, and that is where the dynamic for pushing ahead needs to emerge.<\/p> <p>  At the end of the day in any of these consortia, the people who decide whether it happens are from the institutes concerned.  We cannot make that happen.  I am absolutely of a view, based on what I have observed in the south east, that given a chance to ventilate some of the issues from the past and given a proper framework within which they can progress their stage two business plan, this is perfectly achievable.

The evidence on which I rely comes from the report I mentioned in my statement, which comes from examining the experience of this type of process across the EU during the past 15 years.  My interpretation of the evidence is that the rationale for working with the merging and consolidation of institutes is not about knocking things together but building stronger capability.  It is through, for example, cross-disciplinarity, multi-disciplinarity, stronger quality processes and so on in the larger institution that we can achieve, not just efficiency gain, which should be part of the agenda, but also a step change in quality of outcomes in terms of the student experience, the quality of graduates, research excellence and the engagement the institutions have with their local communities and in responding to real needs.<\/p> <p>  When we start from there, the other message that comes through in the evidence is that one pays for this sooner or later, at the start or in lower-than-expected quality outcomes later.  When we put a university brand on any Irish institution, we need to do it with great care, and this is reflected in the standard, in the very exacting designation criteria, for example.  This also needs to be reflected in the preparation we put in.  In the Dublin context, we have taken three years thinking it through and beginning to action some of the pieces of it.  It will take much investment, and although finding this investment within the overall higher education budget is challenging, we cannot rely on institutions to find the great majority of what needs to be invested from existing pools, given that they would have to take it out of something that is already happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>There are practical issues surrounding WIT regarding managing legacy debt.

My judgment is that in terms of mindsets about real, deep-down collaboration, there were problems on both sides.  That has been confirmed to me by other people who were involved externally previously.  I would not go with the simple assumption that it was simply about due diligence.  Let me deal with that because I have a very strong feeling about this issue.  In the context of the Dublin consortium, we have actually left that matter to item Z.  It is way down the list.  Why?  It is because everyone is dealing with each other in the context of trust.  Our expectation is that there will be open disclosure of relevant data, information and facts and so on between partners in a trusting relationship and that it should not be necessary to rely on very expensive third party examinations to surface data that should normally be exchanged in an open way between two institutes preparing to work together in a collaborative arrangement.<\/p> <p>  I would have serious doubts about the value of moving due diligence way up to the top of the queue because it would set off all of the wrong attitudes, questions and so on.

I have summarised the attitudes that came through and, in all cases, I have actually grouped them as TUI on the one hand and everybody else as part of a group view.  If I can deal with the latter first, I found in general a very strong commitment to the ideal of a technological university for the south east, some natural anxieties about the usual range of rationalisation things and also some levels of frustration with what had gone on already.  One expects trade unions in a process like this to stand up and defend the rights of their members.  That is why they are there and, as such, one expects in the normal course a certain amount of fire in that context.  I found the predominant attitude was not so much concerned with personal interest, but was much more about getting on with this.  It was mission focused.  In relation to TUI, it has fairly well expressed its public attitude about the technological university.  In summary, it is that it is not opposed to it but would like to understand a lot more about how it would work and how it would impact on its members in various ways.  My response to that has been that the academic community will actually be at the heart of any bottom-up processes around the design and implementation of technological university, so they will have every opportunity to participate, as is the case in Dublin now.  The heart of these new institutions will actually be designed by the academic staff in them.

Clearly, Waterford Institute of Technology went through a process with the investigation and we have had a hearing about it.  The most important thing for us is that Waterford Institute of Technology welcomed the investigation and engaged with it openly.  It found a range of issues, gave rise to us having to lend the institution some capital funding and resulted in a wide range of recommendations.  WIT is working through the implementation of those recommendations and those issues are coming up to a certain extent in the audit report which the Chairman is noting today.  We plan, as we always do, to review the implementation by WIT of the recommendations in the Quigley report and we have agreed with Dermot Quigley that he will go back in and review the implementation in WIT of his recommendations.  We have not agreed the timeframe for that, but envisage it will happen later in the year.  As such, we are very conscious arising from the investigation and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on Waterford that there is a need to ensure that the recommendations are implemented and that the governance structures are working appropriately in WIT.  From that point of view, one can understand why Institute of Technology, Carlow would have had some concerns given that this was happening as the process was under way.  Mr. Kelly addressed that in his report.  Waterford IT has been open about the fact that it had issues and that it wants, and is seeking, to address them.  We always planned that this would take place but are now planning to do it by the end of the year.  By asking Mr. Quigley to go in, it means it will not be someone who has to learn the ropes again.

Given the difficulties that this drop in funding causes, in terms of the quality of provision, we need to bear in mind that it has been projected that the number of people entering higher education will grow by between 25% and 30% over the next 15 years or so.  That in itself will place huge demands on the system.  Of course, this issue is being dealt with by the group that has been established by the Minister under the chairmanship of Peter Cassells.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015092400002#CC02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1443085200,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I was surprised to note that the income dropped a bit from 2013 to 2014.

Maybe I will put it in context and I will come to that as well.  I can let the committee have a copy of an outline of the changes the HEA has made to its governance arrangements since it was last here.  I guess these changes were prompted to some considerable extent by some of the criticism from this committee and some of the lessons we learned from the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports.  We have issued a revised template for the governance statements to the institutions.  The governance statement is the key reporting instrument from institutions to the Higher Education Authority.  We have added some additional items to that template.  We have asked each institution for more explicit confirmation that it is compliant with procurement guidelines.  We want a specific assurance on that.  We have asked those institutions that are not compliant to set out the actions they have taken in this regard.  We want to know how many governing body meetings are taking place.  We want to know the level attendance at those meetings.  We want to know the outcomes of the reviews of effectiveness of governing bodies.  We also want upfront information on any significant unexpected expenditure that each institution is incurring.  This is relevant in the context of the presence of representatives of GMIT this morning.<\/p><p>We have also reminded governing bodies, and the chairs of governing bodies in particular, of their central role in the whole governance and accountability system and the need for them to interrogate the information that is given to them by the management team in the institution, and the responsibility of the management team to give full information to the governing body and the chair.<\/p><p> We have enhanced our arrangements with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will now meet on a quarterly basis and that is very valuable because we can share lessons that are being learned from the sector.  We can also get a sense of what is happening in respect of audits and the submission of financial statements.  We will also share information then to identify any early difficulties that are happening in the sector.

Furthermore, they have a procedure in place whereby someone may make a disclosure on a confidential basis.

The five presidents' report, Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, was published in May.  We are delighted today that Mr. Jos&eacute; Leandro from the European Union Commission will talk about this report.  The report sets out a timeframe and a process to complete economic and monetary union through deeper economic, financial, fiscal and political union.  The report references the role of national parliaments in the context of ensuring democratic accountability.  President Juncker's cabinet is seeking a reaction to the plan, particularly from members of national parliaments.  We will spend time in the next couple of months looking at the plan.  Today is the first of a number of meetings that we hold on this subject.  As members will remember, the committee has published two political contributions on different aspects of economic and monetary union in both 2013 and 2014.  Of course, they relied heavily on our experience of the economic crisis.<\/p><p>Today we will hear an outline of what the five presidents' report entails and proposes over the next number of years.  I welcome Mr. Leandro and Mr. Graham Stull to our meeting.  Mr. Leandro is a director for policy strategy and co-ordination in the directorate general for economic and financial affairs of the European Commission.  He is an adviser to President Juncker and is responsible for the preparation of the five presidents' report.  He will brief members on the report.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I also wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#B00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443099600,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I thank the honourable Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the joint committee on the topic of the so-called five presidents' report on the completion of the economic and monetary union.  As you know, the report was chaired by President Juncker in co-operation with the president of the euro summit, the president of the Eurogroup, the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the European Parliament.  It was published in June.  It is the result of an inclusive process which followed from a series of discussions between the presidents and the member states.<\/p> <p>  The report presents a vision and a roadmap for the completion of economic and monetary union by 2025, at the latest.  It is ambitious and yet pragmatic.  It is built on the experiences of the recent crisis, which exposed important gaps in the structure of the economic and monetary union.  The completion of the EMU is not an end in itself but a means to create a better life for its citizens and to prepare the EU for future global challenges, enabling each of its members to prosper.<\/p> <p>  One of the legacies of the crisis is the significant divergence across the euro area.  In some countries unemployment is at record highs while in others it is historically low; in some fiscal policy can be used counter-cyclically while in others fiscal space will take several years of consolidation to recover.  Today's divergence creates fragility for the whole union and a new convergence process must be launched.<\/p> <p>  Progress is needed on four fronts toward four unions, economic, financial, fiscal and political union.  All unions depend on each other and progress will have to be made in parallel.  The reports suggest moving forward in two stages.  In the first stage until mid-2017, the measures concentrate on what can be done right now, building on and making the best use of existing instruments.  In the second stage the report proposes a set of more fundamental steps to complete the economic and monetary union.  Some may require changes to EU treaties in the second stage.  There is, therefore, a gradual move from a rules based system to a system with further sovereignty sharing within common institutions.  As President Juncker stated in his State of the Union address, the Commission will move forward without delay with the first stage initiatives.<\/p> <p>  Let me say a few words on the proposals put forward by the report.  First, economic union should aim to deliver more real convergence, jobs and growth.  In the first stage, this would be achieved through a renewed impetus to the implementation of reforms and strengthening the current governance framework, to be followed in the second stage, by commonly agreed standards with possibly a legal character.  In the first stage economic union rests on four pillars, a euro area system of competitiveness authorities, a strengthened implementation of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, a greater focus on employment and social performance and a stronger European semester.<\/p> <p>  The Commission has already made some changes to the European semester this year, to sharpen its focus, better involve national stakeholders, improve reporting and strengthen the social dimension.  We intend to continue this work, to further streamline it and to integrate the euro area and national dimensions better.<\/p> <p>  The competitiveness authorities should build on existing structures with an emphasis on reform implementation, increased national ownership and a push towards increasing convergence.  The implementation of structural reforms should facilitate the ability of member states' economies to adjust to future economic shocks, while supporting convergence towards the best performance and practices in Europe.  In Ireland, a rapid adjustment was key to restoring competitiveness in the aftermath of the crisis but as in many member states, fragilities remain, particularly in the non-traded sector. <\/p> <p>  Second, the aim of the financial union is to create a truly single financial and banking system where monetary impulses are transmitted uniformly across countries and where financial markets contribute to the stability of the EMU by diversifying risk across countries.  The setting up of the single supervisory mechanism and the single resolution mechanism has already contributed to weaken the links between banks and sovereigns but initiatives have to be completed.  First, we need to focus on implementing what has already been agreed, including the transposition of the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive and reaching an agreement on bridge financing and a back stop to the Single Resolution Fund.  A common deposit insurance scheme is also indispensable for a complete banking union and to ensure that the safety of bank deposits is the same in all member states.  The Commission intends to come forward with proposals on first steps towards such a scheme before the end of the year.  This could take the form of a re-insurance system at European level for the national deposit guarantee schemes.<\/p><p>It will also be important to ensure that all banks participating in the banking union enjoy a level playing field by reducing the still-significant discretion at national level that has important implications, notably for the quality and composition of banks' capital.  Finally, a capital market union will contribute to the integration of equity markets, reduce the volatility of cross-border investment and enhance risk-sharing.  In Ireland, where small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, financing costs remain above the euro area average and Irish SMEs still look primarily to banks for their financing needs, the capital market union will have a particularly important role to play.<br\/><br\/>As for the fiscal union, in the first stage the report proposes that a new advisory European fiscal board would be created with three functions.  First, it would co-ordinate the work of the national fiscal councils.  Second, it would offer an economic, not legal, view on the appropriate fiscal stance and third, it would carry out <i>ex post<\/i>evaluations of how the fiscal governance framework was implemented.  In the second stage, a new macroeconomic stabilisation function would improve the cushioning of large macroeconomic shocks.  In addition, a euro area treasury would be set up in the second stage and could be a place for collective decision-making on some aspects of fiscal policy.  Ireland has made remarkable progress in placing its public finances on a sustainable path and this is welcome.  However, public debt levels remain high, as they do in many member states, underlining the need for continued prudence and for a strong and transparent fiscal governance framework.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the initiatives put forward in the report involve further sharing of national competences and hence require further steps towards strengthening democratic legitimacy.  It is necessary to increase co-operation between the European and national parliaments and involve them more closely in the European semester.  I know this committee has been engaged in discussing the semester and has shown a keen interest in continuing and deepening that dialogue, which we welcome.  I am interested to listen to the ideas put forward by members on this point.  The strengthening of democratic oversight will also be achieved by the integration of some intergovernmental arrangements into EU law, including the European Stability Mechanism.  A strengthened Eurogroup also will provide a stronger co-ordination centre, possibly with a permanent president in the longer term.  A more consolidated external representation of the euro area should strengthen its voice in international financial institutions, particularly at the IMF, and make it commensurate with the euro area's economic weight.<br\/><br\/>Completing the economic and monetary union is a dynamic and evolving project and the Commission remains open to answer questions and to listen to members' views.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jos&eacute; Leandro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Leandro and at the outset will pose a few questions on which he may be able to expand.  In his useful contribution he mentioned a proposal for new competitiveness authorities.  I note from the report that one key role would be to assess whether wages are evolving in line with productivity and to compare with developments in other euro area countries, which is fine, as well as in the main comparable trading partners.  I take \"comparable trading partners\" to mean places like the United States, Asia and elsewhere.  I have concerns this might mean such competitiveness authorities would come up with proposals to reduce rates perhaps, whereby wages would be forced down or recommendations made that wages be reduced because of factors such as what are termed \"McJobs\" in the United States and the race to the bottom in many areas.  Can Mr. Leandro expand on the co-ordination that would happen to suggest wage levels across Europe?  In addition, how might this be reflected in the annual growth survey and the country-specific recommendations?  Were countries to fall foul of those, might they be subject to a corrective mechanism?  I worry because Ireland has just set up a body called the Low Pay Commission to address the issue of low pay, to recommend whether the minimum wage should be increased and to consider proposals such as the living wage.  It appears to me as though this new competitiveness authority would be in direct conflict with the commission.  Consequently, I ask Mr. Leandro to expand on that point and perhaps settle my concerns and nerves in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Before inviting questions from my colleagues, my second and final question concerns the proposed euro area treasury.  Mr. Leandro stated a genuine fiscal union will require more joint decision-making on fiscal policy.  While he recognised many decisions will still be left to national governments, he noted some decisions would increasingly need to be made collectively, while ensuring democratic accountability and legitimacy.  What type of decisions does Mr. Leandro think can be made collectively?  Can he expand on the type of things one should expect to see done together, as opposed to done by national parliaments on their own?  I now call on Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#C00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I thank the guests for their appearance before the committee.  Arising directly from Mr. Leandro's address, can he indicate the extent to which he expects eurozone countries to reduce progressively current borrowing, that is, their budget deficits?  Are all countries progressing satisfactorily and what does Mr. Leandro perceive to be the benefits accruing therefrom?  In addition, with regard to total debt among eurozone states, to what extent does the Commission remain satisfied as to the ability of each state to continue to reduce its overall debt in line with projections and expectations?  To what extent does the Commission envisage the total debt in each country within the eurozone will reduce and as a consequence, what will be the eurozone average reduction?  I am conscious of the average at present within the European Union, within the eurozone and in Ireland, as well as the progress made and the progress that still remains.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the ability of each state within the European Union to avail of the kind of conditions Mr. Leandro has outlined and to increase its productivity, competitiveness and economic growth in the knowledge that at present, there is a huge disparity in the growth and development of individual member states.  Remarkably, this State has the highest growth rate in Europe at present, as well as one of the highest rates in the world.

Overall, is there a better role for national parliaments within the European semester process and how can this be refined to ensure accountability within the system?

It states that, for obvious reasons, the currency is facing common challenges and responsibilities and that the process towards deeper union is open to all EU members.  Do the witnesses not think that, on one level, we are deepening the chasm between those members of the Union who are in the euro and those who are outside?  A lot of the proposals in the report which are designed to lead to the strengthening of the euro area could be seen to remove independence of action on another level, or remove sovereignty from some other nation states which are not involved in the euro area, particularly the United Kingdom, with which we have a relationship based on our history and geography.<\/p> <p>  In his statement about the success of Ireland, Mr. Leandro stated that rapid adjustment was key to restoring our competitiveness in the aftermath of the crisis. I was struck by the idea that one size fits all in terms of the economies of member states.  There may be particular reasons why a rapid adjustment may have suited Ireland.  In particular, we do not depend to the same extent as other member states on trade within the union and so may be less exposed to the financial health of the Union than some other member states.  Does Mr. Leandro have any thoughts on this?  Are we, perhaps, too wedded to a one-size-fits-all approach for fixing the economies of other countries which have suffered from the global financial crisis?  If we are to put in place better shock absorbers against future economic shocks do we need a rethink on how rapidly we are asking some member states to fix their balance sheets?  Maybe slower progress might be better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#D00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443099600,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I will try to address all the questions.  The first was on wages.  Competitiveness is not just about costs or wages.  It is also about productivity, which concerns a very wide range of issues from skills, education, innovation, etc.  The report states that the competitiveness authorities will be institutions or bodies which will foster a debate about policies which foster competitiveness.  As part of their mandate they should cover the evolution of wages compared to productivity because this is one of the indicators of competitiveness, which is called, in technical terms, \"unit labour costs\".  This is just one indicator of competitiveness and there is a wide range of other indicators of competitiveness.  In Ireland the National Competitiveness Council is already looking at a very broad set of indicators of competitiveness.  It has not been decided yet but the Commission will propose a mandate for competitiveness bodies and this mandate will be broader than the simple, narrow focus on cost competitiveness.<\/p> <p>  These authorities are not aimed at harmonising the way wage-setting mechanisms are negotiated across the eurozone.  These mechanisms respond to a wide range of national preferences and legal traditions and the intention is not to interfere with them at all.  It is simply to add one more element of information that would be useful when the wage negotiations take place among the social partners, business and the unions.  They would have a view of the implications of the different options compared to the main trading partners.  In Ireland the main trading partners are the UK, other member states in the eurozone and, because it is a very open economy, countries outside the EU.  It is not just about competitiveness among EU member states.  The competitiveness authorities would not interfere with the setting of the minimum wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jos&eacute; Leandro"},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>Why, then, are they going to meet and co-ordinate an approach?

It would be able to give recommendations on a more educated basis.  We would know much better what is going on in each member state than we do now.  On the other hand, these competitiveness bodies would also help feed into the debate nationally about wider issues of competitiveness within the eurozone, because competitiveness is a relative issue - one is competitive<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>someone else.  This euro-area dimension is very often absent when the national debates take place.  It will work both ways.  The idea is not to have a one-size-fits-all approach across all eurozone member states - let me be clear about that.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about the euro area treasury.  I mentioned wages and the Chairman mentioned the Low Pay Commission in Ireland, which recently proposed an increase in the minimum wage.  This is a purely national issue.  The Commission would not interfere in this type of decision at all and has no intention of doing so.  The report makes it clear that the euro area treasury is the culmination of a process of the gradual integration of the fiscal area.<\/p><p>It is not something that would happen tomorrow and that is why the report puts it in the second stage.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked in what areas could there be a collective decision.  Each member state must still be free to decide on taxation and the exact allocation of expenditures.  For example, one could think of a fiscal union, because this would be the culmination of a process leading to the fiscal union, issues like the level of debt or the level of the deficit could be taken collectively.  That is the aggregate figure of the debt of the amount of borrowing; the aggregate figure on the debts could be taken collectively.  Then each member state within those limits would be able to decide, depending on its own preference, on taxation issues and how to allocate expenditures.  This is how we would see a euro area treasury in the longer term.<\/p><p> On the question regarding the debt and the progress so far in reducing debt, there has been progress at an aggregate level.  The level of the debt is now about 97% or 98% of GDP.  We can see that the debt is clearly coming down in a number of member states.  That is the case for Ireland where it has been very visible and the level is now 107% of GDP, more or less.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jos&eacute; Leandro","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>It is less.

A big issue that we often tend to overlook is private sector debt which remains very high, including in this country.  It is an issue that needs to be tackled, probably more forcefully, but the report does not go into these issues.  The report does not say how we should deal with public or private debt but simply offers a roadmap.  Of course, such debt is a fundamental issue in the background.<\/p> <p>  I understood that one of the questions asked was what are the obstacles to more competitiveness, investment and growth.  From my perspective, there are issues both on the supply side and on the demand side which need to be tackled at the same time.  We have cyclical factors that lead to lower investment, lower consumption and, therefore, higher unemployment on the cyclical side but there are also structural impediments to higher investment and employment.  We need to act on both aspects through structural reforms.  We need to address the more structural elements of these obstacles while, on the demand side, we need to use the flexibility within our rules to facilitate and better manage the cyclical aspects of unemployment and investment.  The Commission has decided to launch an investment programme of &euro;315 billion which reflects the approach that one needs to act on both sides - the demand side and the structural side.  <\/p> <p>  There was also a question from Deputy Kyne on how to better involve the national parliaments in the Europe semester process, particularly in terms of the country-specific recommendations.  This is a key issue in the report.  First, in our view the parliaments should be much more involved and consulted in the design of the national reform programmes before they are submitted to the European Commission.  Second, member states should use the ability that is already there to call on Commission officials and commissioners to explain why they recommend these audit measures, including when the Commission gives an opinion on draft budgetary plans.  This aspect is already provided in the so-called two-pack legislation but it is not systemic or systematically used.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on sovereignty.  It is a complicated issue because it is often presented as a zero-sum game.  In fact, in many areas the pooling of sovereignty is a way of regaining sovereignty in a world that is becoming increasingly globalised.  Including within the European Union, where we have more and more interdependence, sovereignty becomes a very relative concept.  One way of regaining sovereignty is by pooling it, including on issues of fiscal policy.  For example, we have already pooled sovereignty in terms of monetary policy but we have not done so with the fiscal and financial sides which led to the mess that we all know about.  Very often the pooling of sovereignty is a way of regaining sovereignty.  When we put in place a single supervisory or resolution mechanism for the banks it was a way of gaining sovereignty over the financial sector.<\/p> <p>  The division between the ins and the outs is an issue about which the Commission is very sensitive.  The report focuses on proposals to strengthen the euro area.  Many of these issues have implications for the non-euro area member states, including for the banking union.  For example, when we talk about a deposit insurance scheme or the capital markets union, this cannot be decided by the 19 euro area member states alone; it has to be decided by 28 member states.  Any issue that touches upon the functioning of the Single Market has to be decided by the 28 member states and cannot be decided by just 19 member states.  On the other hand, having a common currency among 19 member states creates a level of interdependence that does not exist with the non-euro area member states.  There are issues on which decisions have to be taken among the 19 member states because it is key for the function of the common currency.  This is the way we, in the Commission, see these issues.  Maybe I shall stop there but I am happy to continue.  I hope I have answered all of the questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015092400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jos&eacute; Leandro"},{"type":"speech","time":1443099600,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>How has the report been received across Europe in other member states, particularly the countries that are outside of the eurozone?

In my very brief introduction I want to look at the bereaved and those who were severely injured.  One third of WAVE&rsquo;s new referrals in the past year were bereaved persons. Since 1991 WAVE has been working with those bereaved and injured in or traumatised by the Troubles, regardless of community background, religious or political beliefs. To give members a sense of those who present to WAVE, 17 years post the Good Friday Agreement, they are aged between seven and 93 years of age.  Some  44.9% are male and 55.1%, female.  The average age is 51; however, we work with people between the ages of seven and 93 years of age.  The religious breakdown is fairly equal.<\/p><p>Over 80% clients were resident in the six most deprived decile areas in Northern Ireland.  The incidents that prompted clients to come to WAVE happened over a broad timescale.  The data for last year indicate that 23.1% of the people presenting were affected in the 1970s, 23.4% in 1980s, 28.6% in 1990s, 14.8% in 2000 and 10.2% in 2010.  I wanted to give these statistics for a variety of reasons.  Many people assume that the legacy of the Troubles has not left the imprint that it has.  Many individuals are presenting for support and assistance today some 40 years after the incident or 17 years after the Good Friday Agreement.  Many of them present with a range of difficulties from psychological, physical, financial, social and some come with a sense of a perceived lack of justice.  While 91% of those killed were men, the figures for men coming forward for help have risen year on year and are now just under 50%, with the average age being 51.  Many are coming from areas of high social deprivation and are most likely to be economically inactive.  Transgenerational issues are evident, with children from the age of seven years up presenting to WAVE requiring support.  WAVE serves all sections of the community without distinction. <\/p><p> For the bereaved, a variety of issues may be evident, including feeling forgotten and a sense that their loved one's death was in vain may often be evident.  Some families and individuals are presenting with complex grief compounded by the circumstances of their loved one's death - for example, a family member of the disappeared or someone whose loved one has been labelled an informer.  Others are clear in their pursuit of truth and justice.  Even within families there can be differences in what members want to see happen.  There can be differences within families as to how they want to see the legacy of the past addressed.<\/p><p> Since the Good Friday Agreement victims and survivors have seen many different processes.  In 1998 Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s first victims' commissioner, identified the need for a process to deal with the past.  While aspects of his report were addressed, the issues around truth and justice were not.  The historic enquiry team, HET, did some good work for some families but for others it was insufficient and the structure of HET and protocols were flawed.  In 2009, the Bradley Eames report offered new potential and many victims and survivors engaged fully in the process.  Sadly, however, this did not progress.  The Haass O&rsquo;Sullivan talks in 2013 sought engagement and consultation and Richard Haass, in a meeting with WAVE, noted that a large number of responses had come from those bereaved and injured.  Sadly, victims and survivors again saw this process flounder.  Just before the HET closed, we were told that a number of cases would be fast tracked and were in the top 10%.  Two months later, the Chief Constable announced through the media that the HET would close.  The handling of people and the support, care and respect shown to them has been difficult.  People are getting older and the sad reality is that relatives have died who did not get the answers or information they wanted.  <\/p><p> We want to see progress on the historic investigation unit, HIU, and on the independent commission for information recovery, ICIR.  The Stormont House Agreement cannot be another failed attempt to deal with the past.  Recognition and acknowledgement are crucial for victims and survivors who have been bereaved.  We would argue that the bereaved should receive greater financial support through the Victims and Survivors Service that was set up to provide support.  Sadly, year on year that support has been reduced which has caused difficulties for many of the bereaved.<\/p><p> In 2012 WAVE commissioned a research study to explore the specific needs of the injured and their families.  Many injured people reported that their needs were practical and physical and included, for example, appropriate wheelchairs and limbs, appropriate housing conducive to meeting their needs and financial support to improve the quality of their lives.  Out of this research study WAVE&rsquo;s injured support group lobbied and proposed a special pension for those severely injured as part of a campaign for recognition.  We must bear in mind that the injured have been overlooked in successive reports.  They were overlooked in the Eames Bradley report and even in the Haass report.  The HIU and the new structures that have been proposed do not have any structures in place to deal with the injured.  The injured are only included if there was a fatality. <\/p><p> The pension proposal is included within the Stormont House Agreement and our group will continue to work to ensure that this is achieved.  Many of the injured, particularly from the 1970s and early 1980s, have long exhausted compensation payments as they outlived their life expectancy.  While there was disability discrimination throughout the Troubles, there was also Troubles discrimination in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and many struggled to find work.  The pension under the Stormont House Agreement would be an important form of recognition and acknowledgement and would facilitate the injured in having some degree of financial security in the longer term. <\/p><p> Individuals differ and no single process will meet everybody&rsquo;s needs.  The most important aspect to all processes is that victims and survivors must be central.  They must not be pushed to the margins or ignored but must be central to it.  We have seen some progress and since we last met this committee in December 2013, three of the disappeared have been located through the work of the independent commission for the location of victims&rsquo; remains, ICLVR.  The commission has worked well and that is uncontested.  Everyone has the right to bury their dead and to afford a loved one a Christian burial.  I would like to thank successive Irish and British Governments for their continued support for the commission.  I would urge all members of this committee to continue to highlight the mechanisms that exist to give information to ICLVR so that the four remaining disappeared are returned to their families for Christian burial. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Peake.

The Tara Centre is just down the street from WAVE and we are well aware of the tremendous work that WAVE has been doing.  While Ms Peake and I did not prepare together in advance of this meeting, having listened to her I can see that my approach will complement hers.  I grew up in Youghal in County Cork, far away from the Troubles of Northern Ireland.  I had no intention of ever being in Northern Ireland but circumstances brought me there.  I am now 21 years living there and I was invited at a very early stage to become part of the implementation of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  This was just before the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  My response to this was to be a co-founder, with Mary Daly who is in the Gallery, of the Tara Centre, which was set up in the interests of healing, peace and holistic well-being on a cross-community, cross-Border basis.  The centre is now in its 20th year of operation.  I want to gratefully acknowledge the funding we have received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and from the Northern Ireland Office and also the part played by this committee in approving that funding which has helped us enormously.  Over the years, as a stand-alone organisation, we have had to find and dispense &pound;12 million in the development of our centre and in the provision of services across the community.  We very much appreciate the help we have received, including from Members of this House.<\/p> <p>  As an educationalist and a qualified and practising psychotherapist, I wish to take an in-depth look at areas to which Ms Peake referred with facts and figures which we have recorded and published.  One of the issues that struck me in the early days of setting up and developing the centre and while working there as a practitioner over the years is the need to take a very broad perspective in dealing with emotive issues.  We talk about the Troubles, and in the North it is the immediate Troubles, but as someone who has lived there for just 21 years - I will not say for how many decades in the rest of the country and abroad - I see that the roots of the Troubles are very deep.  They go back many, many centuries and we need to keep that in mind.  That colours everything we do.  It does not take from the immediacy but it gives a depth and lets us know that we must be there for the long haul.  <\/p> <p>  The name of the centre is the Tara Centre.  Michael Slevin, who is an authority on Tara, County Meath, tells us that \"Tara\" means a place from which there is a broad perspective.<\/p><p>Interestingly, we took that title and as we got into it a little more we discovered that Tara has many connotations and associations spanning many countries, cultures and continents, including the Buddhist Green Tara, the goddess of healing and compassion, with the same connotation applying in Ethiopia.  I am not avoiding anything.  As a psychotherapist and human being, I know that the healing of the emotions, the psyche and the soul is necessary if we are to endure.  It is what will bring us together as a people.  When we are trying to set up organisations, we need funding and support but more than anything else, we need to respect each others perspective and to acknowledge that the core truth of all of us as human beings is that we come from the same source.  Until we reach a deep awareness of this, in terms of how we live, the bickering, fighting and contesting about not having enough will continue.  The dispensation of creation is that there is more than enough for everyone.  Its the psyche, the mindset, that sets us off our target.  This is what I mean by \"a broad perspective\".<\/p><p> It is most interesting that in concrete terms, the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, such as the St. Andrews Agreement, the Hillsborough Agreement and, the more recent, Stormont House Agreement, take broad perspectives in their approach to this healing.  They quantify it as cultural, political and social.  Currently, there is much focus on the decade of commemorations across the island of Ireland.  That is the breadth we need.  I love it.  It gives me energy.  <\/p><p> Looking concretely at this issue in the Tara Centre, we developed a multidisciplinary package of initiatives which could be offered for the purpose of healing the effects of the legacy of the Troubles.  None of us dares to believe we can heal or help another.  We cannot heal or fix another person but we can support, help and encourage.  However, if we dare to cross the threshold and think we can do it for them, we have lost it.  Everyone can do that for themselves.  All they need to do so is respect, recognition and support.  The package we put together includes counselling psychotherapy and art therapy, a range of complementary therapies, training programmes, workshops, residentials, field trips and support groups.  Those affected by suicide and bereavement of other types and the injured will participate but they will select a particular point of entry.  They may start with psychotherapy and then move to a training programme.  We also refer them outside as well as inside.  In other words, we support them in taking responsibility for their own lives and healing but we are there for them.<\/p><p> What has emerged over time is experiential evidence of a widely proclaimed theory that there is a profound transgenerational dimension to be reckoned with in the lasting healing of all deep trauma at the personal, family, community and broader societal levels.  In terms of my personal awareness, I grew up in Cork and I am of the generation post the 1916 Rising, the subsequent Civil War, the setting up of the Border, development of the Free State and the evolvement of the Republic of Ireland.  Although I was born in Youghal, my parents came from west Cork, Michael Collins country.  As parents, they made the responsible decision to try to protect their family from the trauma.  I see parents in the North trying to do that now.  It is an interesting echo.  My parents tried to protect us.  I was educated and I travelled abroad and trained as a educationalist.  I went to the USA and Europe and had a lot of opportunities.  What I found was that all of the efforts of the previous generation to protect my generation from the effects of the trauma of that appalling violence were in vain.  I then realised that the Swiss psychotherapist C. G. Jung knew what he was saying when he said: &ldquo;What one generation seeks to forget, another generation is forced to remember.\"  There is immediacy in the North at the moment.  There is immediacy across the Border and in the work of these islands in coming together but we must keep the broad perspective and the depth in mind if we are going to be effective in the long term. <\/p><p> When in the United States, I trained in psychotherapy at university level at the Presbyterian-run counselling centre in downtown Chicago.  I worked hard.  I had to do personal counselling and to do so rigorously week on week, following which I thought I had all my demons surfaced and was ready to be a counsellor.  I was posted to Portadown, Northern Ireland, from where I commuted up and down to Belfast.  I realised then that all of the transgenerational effects of trauma that my good parents and their generation tried to protect me from were alive and well and living in me and along the streets of Belfast.  I had to take time to do further work to heal.  I knew that if I could not heal myself, I could not dare to stay in the north of Ireland and attempt to try to be part of the peace building.  I did the work and I thought I was very smart.  I then moved from Portadown to Omagh which seemed to be a quiet place where I could do some work and not be ruffled too much.  <\/p><p> We opened our centre in 1996.  We were doing nicely.  We were overwhelmed straight away with applications from all sectors of society.  In August 1998, barely five months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the worst atrocity of Northern Ireland happened a few hundreds up the street from our centre.  It was the Omagh bombing.  I was so frightened I did not want to visit the site of the tragedy that night but I was reminded by the people around me that it was my duty to do so and so I did.  I could not believe it.  The mother of one of the young victims blown to bits called me across the hall and asked me to accompany her and her family to identify her son in the morgue.  I went with her and identified the young man.  I saw that woman put her hand under the blankets and take it out again covered with blood.  That taught me the appallingness of the depth of the pain that people have to suffer.  There is no such thing as a backdrop in the Northern Ireland situation.  Sometimes I find - I do not begrudge anything to anyone - that there are awful hot-spots in Belfast, Derry and other Border regions.  It is everywhere.  In my practice as a practising psychotherapist I meet it daily in the lives of the clients who come to the centre.  What is most interesting is that most of the time, they do not know why they have come to the centre.  We provide long-term counselling.  We will treat people for as long as it takes, as long as real work is being done.  Once trust and confidence has been built up between the client and therapist the deeper layers, similar to the ones I thought I had buried, begin to surface, following which the real healing happens.  It is long-term work that requires patience and respect, the best of which cannot be shared.  <\/p><p> I would like to tell the committee about a lady who came to see me after the Omagh bombing.  She had been caught up in the incident and as she was a nurse, she had helped people at the scene.  I was ready to deal with her trauma but what surfaced was that when a student nurse in Belfast many years earlier and on duty in the Royal Victoria Hospital, masked men came to the hospital and asked her at gunpoint to bring them to the bed of a particular named patient.  She could not do it.<\/p><p>They frog-marched her and shot him dead in front of her.  She was only ready to deal with what had happened on that day 18 years later.  That is what I mean by \"the depth\".  In the relative tranquillity of these days - it is funny because these days it is anything but stable - these matters come gradually, namely, two steps forward, one step back.  There is a relative tranquillity in society and that is the environment in which people can begin to feel secure and safe enough and in which the deeply buried trauma will surface from the subconscious.  I am talking about the micro level on the ground.  All the organisations must remain for them.  We must be very supportive, even if we have to be critical for integrity, of the genuine efforts being made at the political level every day on this issue.  Essentially, there must be a broad perspective.  The approach must be in-depth, transgenerational and for the long haul.  The macro and the micro must be let support each other, as we have been trying to do.  We need to be hugely appreciative of everything people are doing.  When we have to be critical, we must be.  We have to stand up and be counted.  I will never be found wanting in that regard.  It is important not to go down the negative road.<\/p><p> I am most grateful to the committee for giving me the opportunity to put my story across.  My story is just a tiny piece in the midst of all of the others told.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Sr. Maura Twohig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>I thank Sr. Maura Twohig.

The organisation was formed in 2012 to act as a cohesive voice for these individuals and to bring together some thoughts on policy which had been lacking heretofore.  The organisation&rsquo;s status is voluntary.  It does not receive funding; nor does it wish to receive it.  The organisation has a very clear position on terrorism and violence.  It stands on the solid legal and moral foundation that in the context of Northern Ireland there was not and is not a justification for the taking of life in either the advancement of or the defence of a political objective.

IVU believes innocent victims and survivors of terrorism have been used as collateral damage for many years.  In 1998 there was a peace agreement which brought about the Belfast Agreement.  For all its pros and cons, at that point at least, a referendum was held and the people decided they wished to go with that approach.<\/p> <p>  Part of the Agreement in 1998 was the release of prisoners, when the gates were opened.  Society understood they were released as terrorists on licence.  If we were to think then that 17 years later that these individuals would now be considered in law as victims in the same way as those for whom they were incarcerated, we would have been told we were away in the head.  That is what has happened in this society.  I am conscious, however, of what Sr. Maura Twohig said about not getting into negativities.  If that is what comes across from this, I am sorry, but a reality check is also needed.  We need to recalibrate society because it has gone too far.  A pause button needs to be used and we need to start to examine how the peace and political processes have been rolled out in the past 17 years by two national Governments.<\/p> <p>  It is our belief the definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; is at the root and heart of the difficulties in seeking resolutions of victim issues, a point that needs to be considered.  In 2006, when the Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 dealing with this matter was introduced in Westminster, not a single individual in Northern Ireland had a view on it.  Victims and survivors certainly did not, nor did the local political parties.  It was ushered through Westminster in 24 hours.  We have argued for a long time that there needs to be a referendum held on this issue.  IVU has engaged with the main church leaders, political parties, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Orange Order and a plethora of other organisations.  We want a debate on this issue to have the matter resolved once and for all.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that people who came from terrorist backgrounds and their families have suffered.  If one loses a loved one, be they a member of a terrorist organisation or otherwise, the loss is the same.  The point is that providing services and a legal equation for those individuals is not right.  There are health-based and welfare services.  For the citizens of any nation, there is an entitlement to be in receipt of these.  However, we have to be conscious of what message we have sent when all are considered to be victims.<\/p> <p>  We are in Dublin today and I would not miss the opportunity to bring the following issues to the fore because we have been working on them for some time.  It is the belief of those based in borderland areas that the Republic of Ireland, the State and its Administration, have issues to answer for over the course of the Troubles.  We have been engaged on this isue for some three to four years.  We have met the Taoiseach and other senior policy people on the need for a formal acknowledgment of failures on the part of the State during the years of the Troubles.  I am talking explicitly about security and extradition policies.  There needs to be a formal acknowledgment of the arms crisis of 1970, the formation of the IRA, the financing, training and the procuring of weaponry.  These issues have not been dealt with satisfactorily, neither have failures in terms of extradition polices at judicial level which led to shoot and scoot or hit and run killings across the Border.  The area in which I am based and work is south Fermanagh.  The statistics are available and there is no need to exaggerate or embellish them.  In south-east Fermanagh, in five small wards, 42 lives were lost during the Troubles.  Of these, 38 were murders committed by the Provisional IRA, PIRA.  Two innocent Roman Catholic civilians were stabbed to death by soldiers of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment.  Two IRA members died, as they term it, on active service.  Where was the conflict in south Fermanagh?  There was no conflict.  It was one-way traffic.  There are other parts of the country where that also was the case.  Whenever we talk about the language used of it being a conflict in Northern Ireland, it must be remembered the situation in these Border areas was very different.<\/p> <p>  We also feel there needs to be recognition of the ethnic cleansing of areas.  This term is not liked by some as it was used in the Balkans.  However, in reality, that is what happened in areas of Fermanagh, Tyrone and south Armagh.  It might have been on a much lesser scale, but it happened.  For the individuals involved, there has never been redress.<\/p><p>To coin the comments of one individual, a part-time UDR soldier who had been shot up twice on his farm and forced to leave with three young children, \"The IRA did not take my life but they took my way of life\", because having come from a farming family of 11 generations, overnight he became a townie.  I say that with the greatest of respect to those members who live in a town centre or city environment.  However, he had no choice and became a city boy overnight.<\/p><p> I will move to the area of reparations and, obviously, the issue of a pension for the injured, which had been part of the Stormont House discussions, is foremost in discussions at present.  Ms Sandra Peake and her organisation have done sterling work over the years in bringing this issue to the fore.  This issue again is a symptom of why we have got it wrong in respect of victims policy because they are being asked two questions on this particular matter.  First, they are asked whether they would benefit from receiving a pension, whether it would benefit their lives and whether it would make things easier.  The answer given, of course, is \"Yes\".  The second question they are asked is whether they will accept this pension if ten individuals, six loyalist and four republican who have themselves been seriously injured while carrying out acts of terror, also receive it.  Why should a victim survivor be asked that question?  Again, it is a negation of government not to deal with that matter properly, and 390 people have been prevented from receiving much-needed support.  We have raised this in recent weeks and, believe it or not, the actual item they need more than anything else, which everyone around this table would take for granted, is oil.  This is because with the physical injuries they have endured, for pain relief purposes oil is an absolute necessity, that is, having it on full-time and making sure that keeps their pain at bay.  Is it not ironic that while those individuals require oil, there are criminal empires across this island comprising those who have made wealth on the back of oil?  These individuals have the oil while victims need oil.<\/p><p> As for reparations, it is not only about finance but also about acknowledgement and accountability, and other sectors of people must also be considered after the discussions that will take place concerning the seriously injured.  Obviously, these are the immediately bereaved, the next of kin, who in many instances received extremely poor compensation at the time when their loved ones were murdered and who often were obliged to bring up children in one-parent families and who I must say made a fantastic job of it in the main.  These people are the heroes in this society.  As for those displaced and ethnically cleansed to whom I already referred, farms lie in rack and ruin and houses are dilapidated and falling apart.  Again, where was the help for those individuals?  It did not come.  I acknowledge this is slightly outside members' brief, but where there is potential for the joint committee, I urge it to make representations on behalf of those who are victims of Gadaffi terrorism or para-terrorism.  That matter still has not been resolved for those citizens who have been affected in that way and who, unlike those in other nations of the world, have not been compensated.  Again, I ask the committee to please take an interest in that matter.<\/p><p> Another issue that is greatly to our heart and hopefully to that of the committee is equitable services for victims and survivors or, as we dub it, \"end the postcode discrimination\".  We have strong links with victims and survivors based in the Republic of Ireland as well as in Great Britain.  At present, the Victims and Survivors Service operates services on behalf of individual victims and survivors.  However, if one was injured in an atrocity in the Republic of Ireland, be it the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Belturbet or elsewhere, at present one has no gateway ability to receive support via those schemes.  The criterion used for the support for the injured scheme is to be in receipt of the high-level or middle rate disability living allowance, DLA, and that is one's passport to receive support.  There is no comparable benefit in the Republic of Ireland which is recognised as such for people to receive that support.  We have written to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and other senior politicians on this matter but, again, it has not yet been resolved.  Consequently, in looking after their own citizens on this side of the Border, members of the joint committee should make that a matter of urgency because at present they are not being catered for and that is not right.  I do not like to do this but bringing that down to financial terms, it means that were someone in receipt of high-rate DLA care component for a serious injury, &pound;1,500 worth of support could go to that individual.  Such people then automatically have a passport for &pound;820 of financial assistance, as well as &pound;500 for their carers who would be assisting them.  That is &pound;2,820 that could go into a family household annually and, at present, citizens in this jurisdiction are denied that.<\/p><p> As I am conscious my time may be drawing to a close, I will mention in bullet-point format other areas on which we wish to touch.  We are clear there must not be and should not be any amnesty for terrorists or the expunging of records.  Moreover, in our view a truth commission and the independent commission on information retrieval, ICIR, which is contained within the Stormont House proposals, will deliver little for victims of terrorism.  We also make the point that while we call it the Stormont House Agreement, how can it be an agreement when only two of those five political parties which comprised the then Executive have ratified those proposals within their own party structures?  Moreover, one of those two parties has since reneged in terms of welfare reform.  Consequently, the smallest political party in the Executive, namely, the Alliance Party, is the only party that has ratified the proposals but yet they are advancing apace.  Does that not seem strange?  We wish to bring to the fore that this agreement, as it has been dubbed, was done in spite of victims and survivors.  In the case of the Haass proposals, for all their flaws there was an open door ability to lobby and to speak to politicians and political parties in the run-up to those discussions.  Stormont House was a closed doors affair and this was for a reason.  The difference between the widths of the document for Stormont House and the document for the Haass proposals, where almost too much of a hand was shown, would tell one something.<\/p><p> The other area about which I wish to speak briefly today is the proposed historical investigations unit, which is contained within that document, and obviously there are issues pertaining to disclosure.  We have raised this a number of times and our concern is there is a different level of disclosure commitment by the UK Government and by the Republic of Ireland Administration.  The UK Government has committed to full disclosure, the ROI State has committed to disclosure with co-operation.  These two are very different and we have taken legal advice on this and have been advised that there is a marked difference.  At this stage, I should make the point there almost has been a test case in this regard to try, if one likes, to win the contentment and support of the community from which I come, namely, Kingsmills.  We saw the foot dragging that has existed over Kingsmills in terms of the provision of information.  Latterly, 90 pages of documentation have been produced of which 60 to 62 pages were newspaper reports.  Consequently we ask whether there really is real commitment from this side of the Border to deal with these issues.  We make this point plainly.  I may be a citizen of the United Kingdom, but neither State is clean on this problem we have in this place.  The ROI State needs to get its head out of the sand and deal with those matters also.<\/p><p> We also ask members to factor into their thinking in the future the issue of the retraumatisation of victims and survivors through the glorification of terrorism.  Again, we make the point that when individual members of one's family lose their lives, regardless of whoever they were or of whatever organisation they were part, one will grieve for them and will honour them in one's own private way.  As for these public showings of terrorism idolatry, however, what are they doing for this society?  I refer to six, seven or eight year old children being brought to these events and being told these are, somehow, martyrs and heroes.  The people who did not take to the gun or the bomb are the heroes within this society and we need to remember that.<\/p><p> Innocent Victims United asks that the Governments responsible for stewardship of the peace and political processes recommit themselves to the principles of justice, truth and accountability and that they will, without fear or favour, support the innocent victims and survivors of terrorism and other Troubles related violence in their quest to obtain answers.  Society must be embedded with a mindset about when one neighbour wrongs another, and this is because we did not do it to strangers.  We were neighbours together.  The point is, if one comes from a Nationalist-republican perspective, one believes all people living on this island are Irish and if one comes from a British perspective and one lives in Northern Ireland, then one considers all one's neighbours to be British and, therefore, one actually murdered one's neighbours.<\/p><p>That is what happened here: people murdered their neighbours, not strangers.  We feel society must adopt the mindset that when one neighbour wrongs another that they are required to engage in a process of three Rs: demonstrate remorse, show repentance and engage in restitutive acts.  Maybe once these processes have been worked through we can get to individual and societal reconciliation, and not the phony reconciliation we have currently.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenny Donaldson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>I too thank the committee for the opportunity to speak and welcome its consideration of these important but difficult issues.  As an organisation which has been looking at legacy issues relating to the conflict for over 15 years, we are often credited with initiating the debate on them.  However, we only developed this work because that was what people were responding to and asking for, across a range of groups and backgrounds, back in 1999 and 2000.  We realised that when offered a safe space and freedom from external control, people wanted to discuss the legacy of the conflict.  That debate focussed on what we needed to do for victims and survivors, for society and in order to be able to work together.<\/p> <p>  In 2002 Healing Through Remembering, HTR, carried out a public consultation asking, &ldquo;How should we remember the conflict in and about Northern Ireland and in so doing help individuals and society to be healed?&rdquo;  As a result of the response to this consultation we focussed our work in five particular areas of dealing with the past, namely, commemoration; day of reflection; living memorial museum, storytelling or personal narrative; truth recovery and acknowledgement.<\/p> <p>  HTR is a membership-led organisation.  The membership includes people who describe themselves as victims or survivors, ex-combatants, former members of the security forces, clergy, academics, community workers, politicians and housewives.  These members decide on the activities the organisation undertakes in consideration of these areas of concern.  Over the last 12 years we have held hundreds of facilitated workshops and discussion meetings; a number of conferences with local and international input; both open and private conversations on difficult aspects of dealing with the past; and a range of local and international study visits.  We have produced over 30 discussion documents; a dozen short films; a drama; pop-up street theatre; walking tours; and an exhibition of everyday objects transformed by the conflict, which was initially travelling and later static.<\/p> <p>  Key to all HTR's work is not answers to these difficult questions.  What right do we as a group, albeit of diverse backgrounds and committed to the issues, have to come up with definitive answers?  Rather, the emphasis has been on enabling robust conversations, considering possibilities and developing principles to guide discussions and work in these areas.  In particular we have produced &ldquo;Ethical Principles for Storytelling and Personal Narrative&rdquo;, &ldquo;Core Principles for Dealing with the Past&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;, which includes benefits and challenges for each of our key areas of work which we feel need to be addressed.  Copies of each of those documents are available for all members.  I sound like somebody else - \"One for everyone in the audience\".<\/p> <p>  The outstanding legacy issues are that we need to find better ways of meeting the needs of those who have suffered most in, and since, the conflict.  We can never offer them justice, closure or complete well-being.  How could we ever achieve that after what people have suffered?  However, we can, and should, do a lot more to address their particular needs.  We also need to recognise that their needs and concerns may change over time, over generations, or as they gain or learn more from existing processes.  There is also an outstanding issue of what we as a society need to understand and learn from the conflict, which is hampered by the historic issues of lack of trust, suspicion and lack of engagement.  In order to do our best to ensure \"never again\", we need to find ways as a society to better deal with our conflictual past.<\/p> <p>  The success of HTR shows what is possible in this difficult area.  We are proof that people of different opinions, political viewpoints and backgrounds relating to the conflict can work together and find ways to build a better future even while still disagreeing on the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Turner"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  I am aware of a very pressing need myself - I have drunk three glasses of water and now need the bathroom - so I will be brief.  My wife and I are delighted to be invited and included.  Being included in this is very important because there are people isolated in our community whose voices need to be heard.  BBC used to say it is good to talk, but we have yet to tell our story and people have yet to be heard.  I feel the nervousness of this debate because we have to get this right.  It is important to get the past right so that we can go forward.  It is important to clean out the wound and to have the confidence that we can do this.  I feel we can.<\/p> <p>  I had a lovely journey coming down by bus from Monaghan.  Half the people who got off that 50-seater or 60-seater bus spoke to the driver by name and thanked him.  He was called Se&aacute;n.  There are good people in this land.  We are kind and given to hospitality, yet we have to address it to this area of wounds and healing.  We need to open up ourselves to a new thought pattern and a sense of commitment to this.<\/p> <p>  Crossfire Trust was formed from a television programme in the Border town of Crossmaglen.  I saw the bullet holes and the fear and decided to ask God to send someone there to heal and help.  It turned out to be me.  I was 21, inexperienced, came from Tynan, the only son of a Border farmer.  I made that journey to Crossmaglen over many political, cultural and religious backgrounds with a wee burning song in my heart that I was taught in Sunday school: \"Red and yellow, black and white, all are precious in God's sight\".  That is our rock.  It is a new type of equality.  That is where we are coming from.  We now have hospitality at Darkley House.  We care for people who are homeless.  Many of them are victims of the Troubles.  We practise respite, support and events and bring people together, across communities, across nations, England to Ireland.  We are on a journey and we are comfortable with our neighbours.  Our membership is loose.<\/p><p>People are welcome.  We struggle with the victim service, which wants us to sign people in at the door and ask them how they became victims.  We like to welcome people from the south Armagh area who went through so much.  Church members from Darkley were silent for many years, but after 30 years they revisited the events of November 1983, when three elders died.  There are people in the RUC and the British army who come back to south Armagh to retrace their steps because of stress and panic.  The local community in Crossmaglen has been very accommodating in taking widows and servicemen's girlfriends out to those country roads.  There has been a sensitive journey quietly going on.  The Good Friday Agreement, in my opinion, is still the best model we have.  We have had the Eames Bradley report and the historical enquiries team and very public expensive inquiries, but I would like to see an alternative, and I have a suggestion which I will propose to the committee later.<\/p><p> At the moment there is a community exhaustion.  People are tired of talking.  Our politicians and some people in society have become very good at this, fascinated by the past but confused about the future.  Victims and survivors have been told so often, \"Tell your story; we are listening.\"  Needs analysis, consultations, programmes, feedback sessions - of this there has been much, but there has been so little help on the ground, and that needs to change.<\/p><p> At the moment there is great political suspicion as to why, at a cost to our personal peace, some people are moving centre stage in front of cameras to position their parties better for the next election.  I hope this is remembered at the next election.  Knowing how we have voted in the past, I suspect we might continue to vote that way, because this giant is hard to shift, but we do need a change.  Political parties are polarised, but there are different shades of green in south Armagh.  I do not come from a republican background, but it concerns me that the republican community is so split.  Some people might find it strange that I am concerned that a political party cannot stay together to deliver and roll out peace to the grassroots.  When I walk around Crossmaglen I see poor housing and a deteriorating situation.  During the Troubles there was always a place that someone could go to for help, but now, people who have been involved in incidents the past are abandoned.  We are not kind to each other. In south Armagh we also have those involved in the emerging diesel laundering industry causing conflict and jealousy with large houses, private gardens and electric gates.  It causes division.<\/p><p> I have two simple suggestions which I think are profound.  I would like to see a volunteer legal team operate a fast-track investigation process for victims and survivors of past atrocities.  I believe it is offensive that so much money has been spent making lawyers millionaires while widows are left alone to push a wheelie bin out to their road gate.  There are people who struggle to get their grass cut while others have made money out of this.  I would love to see bishops, church leaders, company heads, politicians and those with links to the President and the Queen organise a group of people who would volunteer their services to investigate speedily the events of the past.<\/p><p> Some of the people I know want more than an acknowledgement; they want a court conviction and someone sent to prison.  They are convinced that this will help them, but I still have questions about that, because even ten years in a prison may not be sufficient to atone for the loss of a husband.  But it would be more than an acknowledgment; it would be a recognition of what those victims have asked for.  Some want their day in court, while others I work with are happier to move on and draw a line under the process.  It seems contradictory, but it is something we could look at to offer an acknowledgement of the loss and pain of the event.  Some victims in south Armagh have been pleased to have the acknowledgement each year of a public event, although is kept private, with no media or cameras.  It is a recognition that they have had a loss and are on a journey, and they are encouraged to keep going.<\/p><p> We could have more community-based discussion events, the openness of which would allow neighbour to talk to neighbour.  People have a desire to talk, but maybe the political climate and openness are not there to allow neighbours to talk.  In a community dialogue, more information from the past could come forward which would settle many issues.  I would like to see victims choose a personally identified group which would suit their needs to explore letting go, forgiveness, the rebuilding of trust and the restoration of relationships.  That is quite a sentence, but we have not yet turned the key on forgiveness.  I believe that people do not yet know how to do that.  There is a feeling that it is letting others off the hook - but forgiveness lets you have a good night&rsquo;s sleep.<\/p><p> We need to build trust and restore relationships that have been broken.  In order to achieve this, I would like to see churches become more involved, publicly recognising local anniversaries, praying for victims by name and offering appropriate support for that week or month.  If this were done nationwide it would create a new sense of inclusion and fresh hope.  The use of poetry or hymnody could calm the deep parts and lead people out from the darkness of grief into the openness of trust.  \"Through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come.\"  If we were to continue to quote or to sing it would lead us on to a better place.  It is acknowledging the pain of the past while not settling there but maintaining the journey to a better place.<\/p><p> I would love to see the media being used to tell the story without spin.  Our politicians seem to love the cameras, but at what price? We are losing ground in the community while some of our politicians play games, and I have a growing resentment about that.  The media needs to tell the good news of people&rsquo;s journeys and celebrate the achievement.  Reconciliation and reconcilers need to be honoured and appreciated more.  The journey that victims and survivors can take together in addressing this is amazing.  With everyone on board, we can travel to a better place.  I have a deep-rooted feeling that we can do it together.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Bothwell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>I thank Ian, Sandra, Maura, Kenny and Kate for their informative, powerful, emotive, courageous and thoughtful submissions.<\/p><p>Certainly it is providing great information for us.

I wish to make one or two comments.  Ms Sandra Peake said that even basic requirements of individuals who have been victims and have gone through terrible trauma, such as housing and adaptation of housing, have not been dealt with.  All of us sitting in this room know about the reconciliation, dealing with the present and the past, but we want to deal with the reality, the concerns, and the sufferings of people and the genuine grievances of individuals.  Surely, in society and local administration, be it the Northern Ireland Assembly or the British Government, there has been a huge failure if smaller things which are major issues to the individuals concerned, such as basic housing, basic comforts and basic health services, have not been provided for people who have gone through so much trauma.  Surely those issues could be dealt with in a meaningful way, apart from the bigger picture of how we resolve and make further progress on the reconciliation.  There is absolutely no excuse for administration, be it local authorities, the Northern Ireland Assembly or Westminster, not having in place robust and positive programmes to deal with people's everyday needs in education, social services, health and housing.  Those issues should be moved forward rapidly, not left on the back burner for the bigger issues to be dealt with that, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Donaldson made a suggestion of a public referendum on the definition of a victim.  We have it in our Constitution, which was enacted by the people in 1937, that sovereignty resides in the people in our State and questions on major issues which require the law to be changed sometimes have to be put before the people.  We have had referenda on major issues, the last being in May on the marriage equality issue.  Prior to that, quite a number of our referenda were on European Union issues.  By and large, the Government of the day and the Oireachtas - the D&aacute;il and the Seanad - have to vote through a proposal that is then put before the people.  In a referendum the people answer either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to a particular question.  We have had the experience of the debate in advance of referenda being about everything except the question that was before the people.  We had it with both the referenda on the Nice and Lisbon treaties where it was stated that people would be conscripted into European armies that did not exist, where some said we would have to give up our neutrality, and where others said we would have to hand over our taxation laws to the European Union, all things that could not be done unless our own people acceded to them because unanimity was required in the European Union.  Those issues that were not relevant to the referendum dominated the debate.  It would be a very difficult debate on the issue mentioned as one would first have to get political unanimity from whoever.  I do not know if the Northern Executive has the authority to put a referendum question to the electorate.  That is not straightforward.<\/p> <p>  A powerful statement made by Mr. Ian Bothwell, which gives us much food for thought, is that people have yet to be heard.  We need to get rid of the \"yet\" out of that sentence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#J00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and telling us their stories and the stories of the people with whom they are dealing.  I am on the all-party consultation group on the decade of commemorations which is dealing with an event that happened 100 years ago.  A statement made by the grandson of &Eacute;amon De Valera said there is not a hierarchy of victims.  People might believe there is a hierarchy of causes but there is not a hierarchy of victims because the suffering of their families is equally traumatic to them, no matter what the circumstances of how their loved one died.  It is amazing to hear how the practicalities of the families and the suffering of those who survived atrocities goes on.  The practicalities of simple things, such as assistance in regard to housing adaptation grants, mean that the suffering continues daily.  As Mr. Ian Bothwell said, we have not yet heard from the victims and the families because of the political situation in the North.<\/p> <p>  The most appalling event of the past century was the extermination of the Jews in Auschwitz.  There were 3,000 security personnel, SS officers, in Auschwitz at any one time, yet after Nuremberg only 80 of those ever appeared before a court, not because they could not be found but because of the political situation in Europe afterwards.  We now see a replication in the North of what happened in the aftermath of the Second World War.  The political situation in Westminster, here and in the North is stopping justice for the victims and the families of those who have suffered in the North.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  We do not want a situation where the people with whom the witnesses are dealing not only do not receive justice but also do not receive the practical help that Mr. Kenny Donaldson mentioned in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but which applies on all sides.  If this situation occurs, that means the healing Sr. Maura Twohig spoke about for a nurse, who is dealing with an issue that happened 18 years previously, just does not come.

I was struck by a couple of comments made by Mr. Kenny Donaldson and Mr. Ian Bothwell in respect of issues around the Border.  I am from Monaghan.  I will ask a question rather than make a statement.  What more can be done in terms of dialogue between people in south Fermanagh, Monaghan, south Armagh and Tyrone to give the general community a better sense of what happened to those communities?  Many of the younger generation in our area would not be aware of exactly what went on and would not have an empathy with or understanding of what went on.  What concrete steps could be taken to have public sessions in Monaghan and in other Border areas to explain what happened to give them a better understanding in order that people would have a greater empathy with each other and we could get over the problems of the past and move forward together.  In our own area, in terms of cross-community relationships, the position has improved immensely and things are quite good at the moment.  At a cross-Border level what concrete steps can we take to improve the situation and make things better in the future?

I was struck by what Sr. Maura Twohig said about her parents protecting her from the past and how it was still in her subconscious and at some stage it emerged.<\/p><p>That brings us back to a description of victims: victims of the state, victims of conflict, victims of discrimination and victims of sectarianism.  I was 18 years old in 1970.  I can forever see tens of thousands of people marching on the streets of the Six Counties - marching for the right to vote and the right to have a home.  They are also victims of state discrimination, and that must be acknowledged.  Somebody commented earlier about recognising and acknowledging the fact that they are victims and survivors.  Everyone has been affected by the conflict or by the pre-conflict or post-conflict situation.  They are also victims and must be looked at in that light.  It is about trying to find a mechanism or a way of dealing with it.  I come from a Sinn F&eacute;in background and I look at it as a matter of truth and reconciliation whereby people can be open and honest and deal with the past.  If we cannot deal with the past and what happened, it clouds our way forward.  We need to find a way to deal with that.  We are living in a period in which there is huge conflict all over the world, particularly in the Middle East.  It is conflict for which the big powers have direct responsibility, and they continue to have responsibility for propagating and promoting it.  The question is how ordinary people in our country can find a way to heal.  The only way one will heal is by dealing with the past in the present.  The word \"forgiveness\" was mentioned, and it is absolutely correct.  If one has no forgiveness and one has hatred in one's heart, one will never find forgiveness.  As such, a way must be found to overcome that also.  It is truth and reconciliation with everyone buying in, including governments, combatants and the organisations involved in the conflict.  It is about the root causes of the conflict and about buying in honestly and openly to healing oneself by healing others.  When we are all trying to find a way forward, using terminology that is associated with the demonisation of people in the past is not the way to deal with our difficulties or to heal.  I am on the record as having said that the peace process is irreversible.  There are and will continue to be difficulties because we are coming from a legacy of discrimination, sectarianism, hatred and violence, and we must deal with all of that.  The way to do so is to recognise that each and every one of us comes from a particular position and to acknowledge the hurt inflicted by one tradition on another tradition.  If one does not approach it openly and honestly in that way, one is destroying one's self.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#J00800","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>I will go back to Deputy Smith's question and the issue of practical needs.  To give an example, I worked this week with people who were injured and who had very old artificial limbs.  I nursed in the Royal Victoria Hospital in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the 1970s, we had many people who had amputations following bombings or shootings.  As surgery and technology progressed, more people in the 1990s were paralysed.  People are dealing with limbs that should have been upgraded some time ago, resulting in chronic pain and its associated difficulties.  Part of the difficulty with our health service has been that some of those people had not been reviewed for a long period and there is no assistance for those who may need more specialised wheelchairs to lift them, for example, to a certain kitchen cupboard height so that they can have full independence.  We are pushing at the victims' and survivors' service to reinstate mechanisms to support people so that they can have the very best equipment to meet their needs and to allow them to remain independent and secure.  Injured people's fears are about ending up in nursing care and being unable to live independently.  It is a particular concern.<\/p> <p>  The other issue Mr. Donaldson raised when we were talking about the injured related to pensions.  Legal definitions are for law makers, not victims.  Putting that burden on victims and survivors is not something we would want to see.  What cannot be allowed to happen is that this is viewed as too difficult, with the result that it is not addressed at all, because that would be unjust, immoral and unfair to people.  There must be a way to resolve this and we have to find it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ferris raised the issue of truth and reconciliation.  My concern is that due to the inadequacies of investigations, some families at this stage would not welcome that.  That is the difficulty when we talk about this process.  There is not even agreement within families about how this could be addressed, never mind within our wider society.  One family may want to go down a very clear prosecution route, while others want information.  Some will say it is too difficult to deal with and that they want to close this off and support their families.  There are huge variations.  My concern about the Stormont House Agreement is that we must get it right.  It needs to be actioned, and people have been waiting 17 years for it.  People are dying without having got the answers they want, and we must do something about it.  We must improve what is provided to give people the answers they want.  I want to see swift movement to achieve a system that is right and that delivers the best, bearing in mind that it will never meet everybody's needs and may never be acceptable to 100% of our population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan's question.  Deputy Conlan is a neighbour of mine.  I am in south Armagh and, as such, am just over the road from him.  I note what we are trying to do to broaden awareness around issues in those areas.  We have developed three Border trail routes in Fermanagh which brings out groupings and re-examines the issues in those particular areas.  We have engaged with schools, faith groups and a range of other organisations.  An example is the Cavan Inter-Faith Group, and there are other groupings, including a gardening and allotments group, believe it or not, which came down.  We are very conscious of the issue of young people being pulled back into these problems and, as such, are trying to reach 13, 14 and 15 year olds in particular to bring them out and give them in cold and stark terms the consequences in reality of what they may have in mind.  We talked about the agreement and the absolute insistence people had at that time around decommissioning.  I was only a young fellow of 16 or 17 and I always believed that decommissioning of the weaponry was not the issue.  The issue was the decommissioning of the mindset that wanted to use that weaponry.  The problem is that, 20 years on, that still has not been fully decommissioned.  That is the problem, because guns and bombs can be obtained within a very short timespan.  It is the willingness to use them that is the problem.  We take those issues very seriously in terms of trying to break the cycle.<\/p> <p>  There is goodwill among people south of the Border to engage with these issues.  When we bring folk out, there is no politics and no glamorisation around what happened.  There is no beefing it up, and it is told in very stark terms.  Our organisation comes from a position that whomever was murdered, it was wrong.  There is no justification for taking the life of another.  That leads me on to the point Mr. Ian Bothwell made earlier.  Until we get to a point at which minorities within communities are viewed as valued neighbours, as opposed to tolerated guests, we are going nowhere.  That is the problem right across society, whether one is in a majority Protestant or a majority Roman Catholic community.  Until the minority is valued by that majority community as having a place and adding to the area, one is going nowhere.  Balkanisation will be rued by a majority on the day it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenny Donaldson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I believed I was to address a different topic from that addressed by Mr. Donaldson, the question of the Border, but I am following on.<\/p> <p> A number of PEACE-funded projects started some of the dialogues.  The first thing many of those concerned noticed was that people were really reluctant to begin those conversations and felt quite uneasy.  They were even uneasy about being in a room together discussing matters, matters we just had not talked about for years.  One project we were involved in used a group called Calipo, which produces theatre for young people.  The young people talk about issues and then devise a drama around them.  Calipo worked with youths from the Falls Road and Shankill Road, in addition to a group from Monaghan and, I believe, Dundalk.  The facilitators were young.  When asked about how the youths in Monaghan would understand that we were examining issues associated with the conflict, somebody said, &ldquo;Apparently, we had a bomb in Monaghan.  I guess we will have to cover that.&rdquo;  Those of us working with the facilitators said, &ldquo;No, it is about the young people and what it means to them.&rdquo;  What the facilitators discovered when they talked to the young people was that they said they never go across the Border to visit their relatives but that the relatives across the Border come to visit them.  The youths asked why that was the case and why there is an invisible barrier that they never cross.  They felt many of the issues associated with criminality in their area were linked to the North and that gave rise to additional concerns.  When they started unpacking all this, they realised the conflict was actually part of their everyday life but in really different ways than might be expected.  The children really enjoyed exploring that and examining their here and now rather than seeing the matter through events we remember as being part of the conflict.<\/p> <p>  That ties into the point about the 2016 committee.  Mr. Donaldson is correct that while we need to examine these events and remember them, we must do so in a way that does not re-traumatise people or make the battle continue.  Sr. Twohig&rsquo;s personal experience and even the mention of the Second World War pose a problem.  We do not yet know how to address that.  We have to learn to talk about those difficult issues, not only in terms of commemorating moments in time but also in the context of determining who we are and how we can work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Turner"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>While I am listening, I am reliving those years in the North.  I am challenged daily by the great commitment of so many people, such as those in the organisations Ms Peake and Mr. Donaldson represent.  They devote considerable energy to their work every day.<\/p> <p>  I am 100% behind the view that all the practical steps that need to be taken must be taken.  I need to say that because I am going to go back to my own underpinning level of depth again.  That is not to say others are not doing so.  When Mary Daly and I first went to Omagh, on invitation, to do something about peace there, we were invited to be part of the Omagh Churches Forum.  We were the only two women and the only two non-clerics present.  I remember those involved were great and I learned an awful lot from them.  The first discussion was with people who were all from over the Border, where circumstances were very different.  There was a group we needed to bring to convert and another group we needed to bring to its senses.  Each believed the other was wrong.  I was going out of my mind asking what was wrong and how there could be such differences within the one room.  We did have the courage to say we were not prepared to be part of any activity to bring groups together until we could sit down as a group ourselves for at least a day with an external facilitator to talk to each other from the heart about where we were at.  It was a matter of determining our own areas of prejudice and the problems we had with one another in the here and now.  Until we can do that work ourselves, we are not fit to lead anything.  To the credit of the group, it engaged in this process several times, not just once.<\/p> <p>  Some say they have a political agenda and must get re-elected - that is acceptable as we are all in a real time&ndash;space dimension - but I cannot make that secondary to the pain and grief arising from something else being neglected while money is being spent and my ego is becoming bigger.  Do members know what I am talking about?  Having listened to the contributions here, I noted the genuineness of Mr. Bothwell&rsquo;s tears.  I have seen them before and know how authentic they are.  This peace must be touched.<\/p> <p>  It is not by accident that there is a desire across the country and the world for meditation and mindfulness.  We have been teaching meditation and mindfulness for all the 20 years during which we have been in operation.  In the past few years, we have been oversubscribed.  We recently offered another programme, on foot of which 50 from the small town have signed up, with a view to starting in a week&rsquo;s time.  It is something of a call to know that one must first be at peace in one&rsquo;s own mind and soul.  I note every day that there is a challenge in this regard. The more I keep in the present moment, rather than the past or future, the better.  However, the past and future are in the now.  This is pertinent even as I walk along the street.<\/p> <p>  I was in a place yesterday in which everyone was of a European nationality other than Irish.  Something within me was saying, &ldquo;Dear God Almighty, what is happening our own people?&rdquo;  What had I to do next?  I had to ask why there was a lack of openness that would allow us all to see one another as people?  The individuals to whom I refer were giving tremendous service and were gracious. They were earning a living and they had a right to it.  In other words, I must face my own prejudice every day and until I can actually face it and do something about healing it, progress cannot be made.  In so far as I can achieve this, I can somehow facilitate the healing work that others want to be engaged in.  We should first ascertain where we differ and then go into the other areas.  Forgiveness, mindfulness, awareness and being in the present have to underpin all of the practical tasks that need to be done daily.  If this does not occur, we will do more harm than good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Sr. Maura Twohig"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>I thank Sr. Twohig.

I used to ride my bicycle up the Cor road to look at the pothole that separated County Armagh and County Monaghan.  It is only in recent years that I have gone over to discover Glaslough and a whole new world on my doorstep.  I was very aware as a boy growing up that farmers' sons were targeted.  Some of my neighbours' eldest sons from Tynan, Newtownhamilton and Aughnacloy were killed in the Troubles.  That made me feel very insecure and very aware.  My father continued with the delivery of cattle and hired a man to transport them, a Catholic.  I did not quite understand the significance of this at that time in my childhood.  This made me think, &ldquo;Who are they?  What is that?&rdquo;  It was such that we were suspicious of the Catholics because they came and found information or addresses or the location of farms, and sometimes a farmer died in an isolated farmyard.  I was very aware of that.<\/p> <p>  A grandmother told me her grandson asked her why she had sold the farm.  He said that if she had not sold it, he would have had a site for a house.  He said he had no site and she had no farm.  He asked her why she sold up?  She had to try to recall why she did so.  She had no choice.  How does one tell someone 20 or 30 years after the event why the farm is gone?<\/p><p>I think farmers need to talk and farmers may find it difficult to find the words because it concerns land, generation and inheritance.<\/p><p> The other group that I feel is too silent in Northern Ireland are the widows of RUC members.  They suffered in silence and decided out of loyalty to their husbands not to talk.  I have been at meetings where people have talked about their fear when the RUC invaded, kicked in the door, or ripped up the floorboards, and I saw them cringe because that was one side, while their story has yet to be told.

It is about listening and about recognition.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bothwell was saying that people are sick of talking.  He went on to refer the importance of talking.  Maybe it is the quality of the conversation that is missing and maybe that is the gap we need to focus in on.<\/p> <p>  The whole idea of victimhood or victims challenges us; who is a victim and who is not?  About five minutes away from here a friend of mine was killed, Martin Doherty, who was an IRA volunteer.  There was a bomb being put in a pub with about 200 people in it.  He stopped the people planting the bombs, saved about 200 lives and was killed himself.  I do not think Martin would have thought of himself as a victim.  Certainly his family members were victims.  His sons were left without a father and his wife was left without a husband.  Things like that challenge us.  If people have lived in a State that discriminated against them, does that make them victims?  If people are denied access to education, jobs or housing, does that make them victims?  I suppose it does, but a lot of people do not feel like that.

I am looking at the practicalities.  The issue of reparation in terms of financial help and the Stormont House agreement has been referred to in respect of the welfare cuts.  In the eight years that I was in Stormont, I was very much involved with the social development committee, so my background is in working with benefits.  One of things I have not really heard from victims and survivors groups is opposition to the cuts.  Whatever way people want to dress it up, the cuts will directly impact on victims and survivors.<br\/><br\/>One of the issues discussed in the Stormont House Agreement process was the fact that adults with long-term disabilities would have their benefits protected, as would children with disabilities and existing claimants.  Certainly, as Mr. Donaldson suggested, one of the parties did renege on the welfare Bill, and that was the DUP.  It was not prepared to protect those people and that will impact directly on those who have suffered horrendous injuries and who need care and attention.  The changes will also affect carers, upon whom a lot of victims and survivors very much depend.<br\/><br\/>As someone with experience giving presentations on these topics, I did not really get the impression that the witnesses' groups were vociferous in opposing the changes.  I would have thought it would impact directly on the people they deal with and represent on a daily basis.  I still deal with benefits on a daily basis on a constituency and clinic level, from all sections of the community.  I represent the Newry and Armagh constituency so I am <i>au fait<\/i>with what Mr. Bothwell and Mr. Donaldson have been talking about.  I have probably been around longer than both of them.  At Crossmaglen I ran an advice centre for ten years in the eighties at the height of the conflict and was very much involved with all sides of the community.  I have represented RUC personnel and UDR widows at tribunals, as they were not getting the pensions they were entitled to.  <br\/><br\/>While the witnesses' presentations were very interesting, I do think they could have put forward more vociferous opposition to practical changes that are going to impact directly on the people they represent.  It is important as it will affect not just victims and survivors but huge numbers of people, even more so the proposed changes in the working tax credit when we have approximately 90,000 working poor in the North.  Some people are going to lose up to &pound;2,000 per year.  That will have a tremendous effect.<br\/><br\/>The changeover from disability living allowance to personal independence payments will impact directly on people the witnesses represent also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady MP"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Their presentations were very powerful and evocative.  On the last point made by Mr. Brady, it occurred to me that here in the Republic, when somebody has a very particular, serious illness, unless there is a huge income involved, they will get what is knows as a discretionary medical card.  In other words, they get free health services.  It seems to me that, even within the context of welfare cuts - which nobody wants - and the restriction of budgets, there should still be provision for victims of violence.  I know when we go into the area of victims suffering from trauma, it is more amorphous and difficult to pin down.  Certainly those who have physical conditions arising from having been direct victims of violence, who are wheelchair bound or whatever, should get discretionary full health services, as they would if they had a very serious illness.  Is that the case, and if it is not the case, could we pursue that for the witnesses?

It is about the fact that labelling needs to be removed.  I urge members to go to the \"Silent Testimony\" exhibition in the Ulster Museum when they are in Belfast.  This is 18 portraits of people.  Their eyes show how we must make this work.  The labels have been removed so one does not know who they are and what background they come from, which is what it should be about.  In respect of Mr. Mickey Brady, MP, we have made representation to Stormont and the special advisers and have made recommendations to the Commission for Victims and Survivors in respect of welfare.  We have produced extensive evidence of the impact we believe it will have on victims and survivors.  We see the impact of welfare daily in our work.  Last year, our welfare advisers - we have the equivalent of two and a half posts for welfare - brought about &pound;1.3 million to people who had lost benefits or were claiming them for the first time so we see the impact daily.  We want to see protection for victims and survivors within that.  We think that is very important.  If the message has not got through in respect of the representations we have made, we are keen to hear why this is the case because our victims' commissioner and the people who are tasked should be fighting hard on these issues.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Reilly, the reason for the negativity around the Stormont House Agreement is because we have seen a failure to deliver successive initiatives.  People have put their heart and soul in pushing them.  They see the Stormont House Agreement and the recommendations for victims and survivors tied up in a wider debate about welfare and they wonder what is going to happen.  It is about preparing them for the fact that they may not get what they want.  People are realistic in saying we need this.  <\/p> <p>  My final point concerns education.  Our youth services in the North have been cut drastically.  WAVE has lost youth funding.  We used to have over 300 young people in service provision.  They are no longer there and young people must now be seen through our support structures which are not adequate.

We have raised this in the public domain and with political parties across the board and the two Governments.  Unsatisfactory answers are coming back.  Our constituency has looked at what has happened in respect of the Kingsmill case and that has not instilled a great deal of confidence that comparable commitments will be given south of the Border.  Let us remember that Prime Minister David Cameron got to his feet in Westminster and rightly made redress for Bloody Sunday.  That needs to be replicated across the board in all these issues.  There is provision within the Stormont House Agreement for acknowledgements.  What this means has not been teased out in that paper but we believe that if things are not to repeat themselves, we must put a line in the sand.<\/p> <p>  It goes back to a point I made at the start.  The two governments and all proscribed organisations must make a commitment that the taking of life in the advancement or defence of a political objective is not justified.  It is simple.

There is no question that there were issues for minorities in Northern Ireland to deal with but the point is that this in itself was not a justification to go out and take your neighbour's life.  In the areas we represent, people were not murdered while they were in uniform.  They were murdered whenever they were milking their cows, delivering meals or visiting families.  They were murdered when they were at their most vulnerable.  That is not conflict.  That is not a war.  It cannot be described as that.  We must break this cycle of violence once and for all and that is across the board.  There was no legitimacy for any organisations involved in it, including any state involvement.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Peake mentioned the welfare issue.  Likewise, certainly within the Haass discussions and latterly in the run up to the Stormont House Agreement, we have made representations where we feel there is a very strong case for a special dispensation to be given to victims.  Picking up on Deputy O'Reilly's point around it being more easily deliverable for the physically injured, we would have shared that analysis.  <\/p> <p>  Something else can be done in terms of the Stormont House proposals.  The actual rationale that would be used around the re-investigation of cases that have already gone through the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, process is very unclear.  The HET process was effectively a desktop review.  It did not amount to an investigation and there are many families out there who are very dissatisfied with what has happened.  As this process sits, the remainder of the cases will be examined and then only in very special circumstances will a previous case be looked at again.  The emphasis is almost being put on families and paralegal people to come up with the evidence rather than the actual law makers.  We think a re-balancing is needed.  One cannot put a time-line on justice.  Justice does not belong just to victims.  It is the bedrock of society.  We should not make a victim choose whether they want justice or truth.  Justice must always champion and this must be the bedrock of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenny Donaldson"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>Do any other witnesses wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#N00500","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>To follow on from the point regarding acknowledgement, in Healing Through Remembering, we have looked at the issue of acknowledgement for some time.

As Mr. Donaldson pointed out, why do some of them work while others do not work?  We are very much looking at them as self-authored.  It relates to a group or individual making that statement from their own perspective.  How can it be done in a way that best enables it to have an impact on the audience?<\/p> <p>  Deputies Crowe, Conlan and O'Reilly raised the issue of conversations and stories.  I would make mention of the oral history archive element of the Stormont House Agreement because it often gets lost while everybody looks at the HIU and ICIR, which are more legal aspects.  It is in the agreement.  I am not sure how much it can do but it is touching on those elements so it is important that it gets addressed.  <\/p> <p>  We developed an exhibition of everyday objects transformed by the conflict.  They are lent to us by a range of different collectors, each of whom writes their own label.  That collection went on a tour in 2012, including the Border area and across the Border.  A range of children's groups and school groups visited it.  We thought that because they were objects from the conflict that were old, young people would not engage with them.  In respect of whether it was a milk bottle in discussions about petrol bombs, milk does not come in bottles but they understood what a milk container is.  We had a tape recorder that had recorded things.  They do not see tape recorders but they understood the concepts.<\/p><p>It was an interesting way for them to be able to touch into the everyday life of the conflict in a way that was not necessarily about major incidents and distress.

One of them even asked what he could do to help but that was the last I heard from him.  I am not impressed that our letters have been lost in the system and our voices are not being heard or understood.  Why are we not loud enough?  Why do we not have the required clarity of thought or presence?  Why is so much attention given to our politicians who are moving the system?  Those are questions I am asking myself.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question about Stormont House, we are tired of our politicians moving centre stage and tired of policies that affect people in everyday life being neglected.  I do not understand what the politicians are doing at the moment.  Perhaps one day they will be able to explain the reason they are in and out, up and down and positioning themselves for the television cameras.  Our politicians really can speak to the world through the media and they make wonderful speeches.  While this is very impressive, it does not put bread on the table.  I ask myself why that is the case and what more victims and survivors can do apart from writing letters.  Why is our voice not being heard?

The focus of the points we wish to raise centres on the latest agreement from Stormont, the Stormont House Agreement, specifically provisions for a new historical investigations unit, HIU, with additional points on inquest issues affecting our families.  The Stormont House Agreement provides for a new mechanism to deal with the past in the North, namely, the HIU.  The HIU will have powers to obtain official documents.  The starting point for all investigations, especially into the murder of our loved ones, will be the existing files and materials held by the state.  While we are acutely aware that previous legacy investigations have been hampered by lack of access to official documents, in the Stormont House Agreement the UK Government makes a clear commitment to full disclosure to the HIU.  In order to make this commitment a reality, the HIU will need a clear disclosure power with ability to compel state agencies to hand over the documents it needs for its investigations, including powers that set aside obligations of secrecy.<\/p> <p>  The agreement provides that the HIU is to investigate outstanding Troubles-related deaths, taking on both the outstanding historical enquiries team, HET, and Police Ombudsman caseloads.  There are international obligations to independently investigate deaths.  We are concerned that official legislation may still seek to take a restrictive approach to certain categories of case.<\/p> <p>  Regarding onward disclosure, the Stormont House Agreement provides that the only statutory duty on the independent HIU not to include certain information in its reports to families and publications will be that of ensuring it does not make disclosures that would jeopardise the safety of individuals.  Like many other families, we eagerly await the detail of draft legislation.  We are concerned that the UK Government will seek to roll this back and, instead, legislate for a power for Ministers to veto the contents of reports on the deliberately vague ground of \"national security\".  Such a move would not be acceptable.<\/p> <p>  Regarding staffing, independence and equality, the HIU is to be an independent body.  There is a legal obligation that those working in the HIU have no connection to the persons or organisations that may be the subject of their investigations.  The official position to date has been to defer the HIU employment framework to the HIU director.  The independence of this appointment and subsequent appointments will be critical to the families' confidence in the HIU's ability to deliver.  It is not clear what provisions the UK legislation will have on either of these matters.  The Ballymurphy families will reserve judgement on this mechanism until legislation is put in place.<\/p> <p>  In 2011, the Attorney General, John Larkin QC, directed fresh inquests into the deaths of our loved ones after consideration of overwhelming new evidence submitted by our legal representative, including witness statements and new forensic evidence.  Over four years later, we have yet to have these inquests heard.  This delay has been caused by the wilful failure of the Ministry of Defence and the PSNI to comply with their obligations to assist the inquest.  The Ministry of Defence has informed the coroner that it cannot trace many of the soldiers involved in Ballymurphy.  The PSNI also informed the coroner on 31 July 2015 that the one member of staff assigned to our case had been reassigned to another case.  Only after the threat of legal action was someone reallocated to our case.  The delay has also been compounded by the under-resourcing of the coronial system in the North of Ireland by the British Government and the Department of Justice.  The coroner assigned to our case has been on sick leave since March 2015.  To date, no new coroner has been appointed to fill the position, which has impeded the progress of the inquest.<\/p> <p>  The Stormont House Agreement committed the Northern Executive to bring forward proposals to improve the inquest system.  We call on this commitment to be fulfilled as a matter of urgency.  While the Stormont House Agreement commits to maintaining legacy inquests, we have question marks over how will this be reflected in the Stormont House Agreement legislation.  Legacy inquests have been beset by a lack of resourcing and endemic delays linked to state agencies failing to disclose documents.  Paragraph 31 committed to both inquests continuing as a separate process to the HIU and to Stormont taking steps to improve their effectiveness and independence in accordance with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Why, then, have no measures been taken forward to strengthen legacy inquests?<\/p> <p>  Since the commitment in the Stormont House Agreement  to measures to improve inquests, endemic delays and problems have continued.  The resourcing issues hampering legacy inquests have not been dealt with.  Long-sought investigative support for the coroner is still not in place; the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice has refused a request from the Northern Ireland Policing Board to call Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary to examine the PSNI's role in delays in disclosure; and no effective plan appears to be in place to take forward legacy inquests following the retirement of the senior coroner.<\/p> <p>  The Ballymurphy Massacre left a total of 57 children with the loss of a parent.  There are three judges sitting in the coroner's courts in Belfast.  One is due to retire in October, and his replacement may not be in his post until Easter next year.  The judge dealing with our case has been on long-term sick leave since March 2015 and we recently learned that the other coroner is on sick leave.  With consecutive Chief Constables refusing to meet us, still no police investigation over 40 years later, empty judge seats in the coroner's court and the British Government refusing any proposals put forward by our campaign, where does this leave the Ballymurphy Massacre families today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>It is a great honour for me, as a representative of the Bloody Sunday families, to speak before the committee.  I am the brother of Michael Kelly, who was murdered on Bloody Sunday.  I will begin with a word of acknowledgement.  In 2010, following the publication of the Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, the British Government and British Parliament made an unprecedented apology to those murdered and injured on Bloody Sunday and their families and friends.<\/p><p>The report unambiguously acknowledged the innocence of our loved ones.  The families always knew, the people of Derry and Ireland always knew and now the world knows that innocent people were massacred on the streets of our city.  Though the authorities in Northern Ireland have taken their time, we can also report that there is an ongoing PSNI murder inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.  The inquiry was first announced in December 2012, almost three years ago.  It is our hope that it will be completed shortly and that charges will be laid against those responsible for murder and attempted murder.  There is anger and frustration among the Bloody Sunday families that the murder inquiry is taking so long.  Also, there is fear of the implications of the historical investigations unit Unit, HIU, possibly taking control of it.  As the murder inquiry is in its final stages, we will resist its being moved to the HIU unless we can be convinced that the latter will still enable it to continue to completion without further delay or interference.<\/p><p> In June 2010 the families welcomed the publication of the report.  We still do.  It represented the culmination of our campaign for justice for our loved ones and for the city of Derry.  That said, we do have a number of criticisms of the report, one of which we would ask the help of the Irish Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in resolving.  The first is that we believe that the level of culpability within the British Army and, indeed, the political establishment of that time goes much higher than those mentioned in the report.  We have never been given a satisfactory answer as to why the Parachute Regiment was sent to Derry in January 1972, a regiment with an already infamous reputation for murdering civilians as a result of the massacre in Ballymurphy just a few months before Bloody Sunday. <\/p><p> The second weakness of the report lies in its treatment of Gerald Donaghey.  While it should not be forgotten that the report declared Gerald completely innocent and stated that he should not have been killed, nevertheless, the report did conclude that he probably was carrying nail bombs in his pockets.  This we strongly refute and it remains a festering issue of concern for Gerald&rsquo;s family, the wider Bloody Sunday families and the people of Derry and beyond that this stain on his memory remains.  The Bloody Sunday families and the Bloody Sunday Trust have been campaigning relentlessly about this issue and the new Derry City and Strabane District Council has passed a motion calling for this finding about Gerald to be withdrawn.  On this matter, we now ask for the support of both the D&aacute;il and the Irish Government.<\/p><p> The majority of the Bloody Sunday families would be the first to acknowledge that we have achieved most of what we set out to achieve.  Equally, we acknowledge that many victims, especially those killed by the state and its security forces, still await some resolution of their issues and concerns.  Sixteen years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement it is time for the past to be dealt with in a manner which meets the concerns of the victims, the imperatives of the peace process and the wider needs of society.  We urge the committee to do all it can to see that this happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

It also demonstrates how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish authorities have over the years repeatedly failed the Fullerton family and the people of Donegal by consistently impeding their right to a thorough and transparent investigation into the matter.  Eddie Fullerton was running for a third term as a Sinn F&eacute;in candidate in the Donegal County Council elections when, in the early hours of 25 May 1991, UDA assassins sledge-hammered their way into his Buncrana home while he lay asleep in bed.  They shot him six times in front of his wife, Diana, killing him instantly and then sped back across the border to Derry, where they set fire to the hijacked getaway car.  Since then, there have been serious allegations that the murder was a result of collusion and grave concerns have also arisen about the role played by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has, over the years, shown little interest in pursuing a proper murder investigation.<br\/><br\/>A significant eyewitness came forward on the day of the murder reporting vital information that should have been investigated immediately.  However, the witness was instead subjected to an intimidating and clandestine interview, conducted by a senior ranking RUC officer and a senior Garda officer, at which no notes were taken.  The crucial testimony was buried in 1991 and the Fullerton family was not informed of this significant development at the time.  In December 1991, just seven months after the assassination, the Garda held an inquest affording the Fullerton family just a few days&rsquo; notice to attend and no time to avail of legal advice or representation.  No forensic or ballistics evidence was brought to the inquest, even though we now know that a ballistic link to a previous murder had already been uncovered by the RUC and revealed to the Garda.<br\/><br\/>Under Section 25 of the Coroner&rsquo;s Act 1961, a coroner shall, on an application by the senior Garda officer, adjourn an inquest if criminal proceedings are being considered or have been instituted.  No such application was made by the Garda.  In August 2006 an investigative review headed by a senior Garda officer revealed that forensic examinations had linked the guns used in the murder of Eddie Fullerton to 13 subsequent murders for which there were some convictions.  This significant evidence had been known all along by the Garda and the RUC, with no investigative follow-up.<br\/><br\/>In 2007 the Historical Enquiries Team revealed that the identities of persons suspected of the assassination of Eddie Fullerton had been provided by the RUC to Garda authorities in 1991 and again in 1993 and that the Garda failed to respond in any way.  Why?  In 2012 the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, PONI, reopened his investigation into the Fullerton murder examining, among other things, the nature of information provided by the RUC to the Garda and actions thereafter and the robustness of the Border liaison process and information exchange specific to the Eddie Fullerton investigation.  To provide a context for his investigation, the PONI's team considered the finding of de Silva's report of the Pat Finucane review, which raised concerns about state agencies colluding with the UFF-UDA to target Sinn F&eacute;in and Republican activists during the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br\/><br\/>In 2013 the Police Ombudsman presented the Fullerton family with an interim document summarising the findings of his investigation.  Of serious concern to the Police Ombudsman was the Garda's refusal to co-operate in his investigation.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>My enquiry has been hindered by the Garda being unable to allow my investigation team access to any of their murder documentation due to the case still being an &lsquo;open&rsquo; murder investigation.  The Garda refused my investigation access to retired Garda officers identified, by my investigators, as likely to have relevant information and knowledge that would assist my investigation.<\/blockquote> <p>The PONI investigation reaffirmed that the RUC had briefed the Garda on critical information relating to ballistics linking the Fullerton murder to other murders in Northern Ireland for which there had been convictions.  The RUC had informed senior Garda officials in 1993 about a significant new line of inquiry pointing to people suspected of being involved in the assassination.  These were never followed up by the Garda and, consequently, key suspects were never questioned.  Why?  The Police Ombudsman also investigated loyalist intelligence caches uncovered in Derry in the late 1980s.  Among files found in one cache that originated with British Army sources was one on Councillor Eddie Fullerton containing photographs and contact details.  The Police Ombudsman could find no record of Mr. Fullerton's having been informed of this recovery by the Garda or the RUC.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the witness account that had been buried in 1991, the Police Ombudsman report determined the witness to be a &quot;significant witness&quot;, that is a person who witnesses an indictable or triable offence.  He declared, &ldquo;I have no reason to doubt that Person A did meet two senior police officers from both sides of the border as described&rdquo;.  The Police Ombudsman investigation also revealed critical new information of significant relevance to the Garda murder inquiry which the Garda had not previously known.  This was transmitted by the PSNI to the Garda for its attention and action in 2013.  The PONI investigation into the murder of Eddie Fullerton had instigated a further, more comprehensive, investigation to examine the links between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, including the handling and direction of state agents.  The Police Ombudsman has stated that the wider PONI investigation, which is due to conclude by the end of this year, will &ldquo;look further into the RUC&rsquo;s strategic and tactical response to Mr Fullerton&rsquo;s murder; this will include the management and sharing of information and evidence with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Fullerton family is fully satisfied that there is a clear case to made against the Garda authorities of gross dereliction of duty, deceit and obstruction of justice.  Given the disingenuous manner in which we have been dealt with in this matter, we have no faith in any further internal reviews or private inquiries.  Our entire faith in the probity of the investigation conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to date has been fatally undermined.<\/p><p> The issues raised in this statement necessitate forthright action by the Irish Government for the immediate establishment of a fully transparent and cross-jurisdictional public inquiry into the assassination of Councillor Eddie Fullerton and the subsequent flawed murder investigation.  The Fullerton family also calls for a reopening of the inquest.  Since June 2009, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had no contact with the Fullerton family, notwithstanding the open status of the investigation and critical new information transmitted by the PSNI in 2013 which constitutes a new line of inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amanda Fullerton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fullerton.

It is an honour and privilege to be the voice of the many families of garda&iacute;, members of the Prison Service, Army personnel and civilians who lost their lives at the hands of terrorists during the Troubles in the Republic of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Independent Victims and Survivors Coalition is a group that was formed recently to give a voice to those people who have been most affected by the Troubles.  While many individual members of State agencies, State forces and the public have been immensely supportive, our voices have remained largely forgotten by politicians, policy makers and the public.  Our group has come together to collectively address this imbalance and to show how our experiences can help shape a better Ireland, North and South.  The group is independent and non-political, and is open to all victims and survivors.  In representing those who have had to deal with the consequences and the legacy of the terrorism that visited their families and loved ones, the group has four aims: Truth recovery, justice, support and services and remembrance and recognition.<br\/><br\/>There are many unsolved crimes from the Troubles, some of which date back 20, 30 and 40 years.  While the terrorists who committed those crimes have had the luxury of living a full life and all that entails, those who have had to live in the shadow of the crimes have not been so lucky.  The victims in these cases have had no answers to their questions, have had no admission of responsibility and will most likely never get justice for their loved ones.  Faced with that stark reality, we are in favour of and would fully commit to a truth recovery process.<br\/><br\/>However, the group feels that the process as envisaged and agreed by the Governments in the Stormont House Agreement falls well short of meeting the needs of victims.  For the Stormont House Agreement to become acceptable to victims the following is required.  The process of truth recovery must be victim-centred with representatives of victims involved in the structures, management and oversight of the process, as was envisaged by the Haass proposals.  Not including the voice of victims at this level is a grave mistake and needs to be rectified by the Governments; the process of truth recovery must be done in public so that victims who have had to suffer quite publicly and have been subjected to public denials over a long number of years can have a public admission of truth.  The exact detail could be negotiated with victims groups.  There can be no hidden truths.  The process of truth recovery must be transparent.  The current proposals stop well short of giving victims all the relevant information regarding their cases and, crucially, they do not allow victims to meet with or question those supplying information or the perpetrators.  Victims must be able to trust the process and to do that we need to be able to test and question the evidence.  Being handed a report by a third party in this manner is not acceptable and is not truth recovery.<br\/><br\/>As was pointed out previously, many victims and survivors of the Troubles will never get justice.  The group realises that with the passage of time evidence becomes harder to obtain and cases become harder to prosecute.  However, many still hold out hope that they will get their day in court.  We are very concerned by the remarks made last year by the former Attorney General, Michael McDowell, that the Government had decided not to pursue historical cases.  While victims were not consulted on the Good Friday Agreement and had no voice in the process, many have now come to terms with the conditions of the Agreement and what that means should there be convictions in cases that are relevant to them.  This group is founded on the principle of not seeking revenge.  In most cases, while the victims would like to see a guilty verdict in open court, the length of a prison sentence is of lesser importance as we realise the implications of the Good Friday Agreement in this regard.  The group does, however, seek assurances from the Government that all historical cases will continue to be vigorously investigated and prosecuted, especially as many of the victims were in the service of the State when murdered in the line of duty.<br\/><br\/>The group is very concerned about the way many of the investigations relating to crimes from the Troubles were carried out.  There appears to have been a gross mismanagement of many cases and those, unfortunately, all seem to be quite similar in nature.  In many cases, eye witnesses were not called to identify perpetrators, material evidence has mysteriously gone missing, fingerprint evidence is missing and persons of interest were not questioned.  The group believes that not all of the issues can be put down to simple incompetence and poor techniques at the time.  We are firmly of the belief that other forces were at play.  The group strongly believes that there needs to be a full public inquiry into the way these investigations were carried out and we ask the committee to support us in this request.<br\/><br\/>The personal stories and narratives of victims are mostly hidden and our voices have gone unheard for decades in some cases.  This group feels that these stories need to be told so that policy makers, politicians and the public become more aware of the harms and suffering that we have had to deal with, mostly alone or within our families, as there has never been any official recognition of our suffering or supports put in place to help us.  Many victims have had to deal with issues such as media intrusion, sleeplessness, othering, anxiousness, panic, fear, mental illness, alcoholism, domestic violence, poor educational outcomes, and marriage break-ups, to name but a few.  Those issues often manifest themselves in victims many years after the initial trauma of the terrorism visited them.  The committee would benefit from hearing the personal testimonies of some victims and I invite the committee to arrange for this to take place at some stage.<br\/><br\/>Our group feels that the Irish Government needs to put a structured set of supports in place for victims and survivors.  We are aware that the Government through the reconciliation fund supports victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and we hope for parity of esteem with those groups.  The group feels these supports should be centred on counselling and therapeutic needs, education needs, respite needs and supports to help victims aid the reconciliation and healing process.<br\/><br\/>In order to achieve that, the group calls on the Government to establish a victims commission and victims forum similar to that in Northern Ireland.  Our vision would be that such a commission would manage these supports and provide advice to victims groups and individuals.  The group would also be in favour of exploring the idea of having one centralised service for victims and survivors groups in the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>For the victims' families and for survivors, remembering and recognition is very important and it is something that we have often had to do in a private and isolated fashion.  During the Troubles 12 garda&iacute;, one member of the Defence Forces and one member of the Prison Service<b><\/b>were murdered while defending this State.  It is a very sore point with some of the families that the bravery of their loved ones, who paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our country, has not been officially recognised by the State by way of memorials or bravery medals.  However, we are aware these cases are in the minority and that there has been recognition in other cases.  This group is also aware that many members of our security forces who served during the Troubles are now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  I also remind the committee that a Member of the Oireachtas, Senator Billy Fox, also had his life cut short by terrorists, as did many civilians in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and individuals such as Tom Oliver in County Louth.<br\/><br\/>Recognising and remembering all victims and survivors equally is something the State has failed to do, mostly because we believe the State does not want to be seen to concede that it was fighting a war against these terrorists.<\/p><p>This group is now calling on the Government to award special service medals to all members of the State's forces who served during the Troubles and bravery medals to those members murdered in the line of duty, if it has not already been done, open discussions with civilian victims on how best to recognise their loss or harm, reopen the Remembrance Commission and create one national memorial to all innocent victims and members of the State's forces murdered during the Troubles, at which an annual memorial service could be held.<\/p><p> On behalf of the victims and survivors coalition, I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to address how the legacy of the Troubles has impacted and continues to impact on us.  We believe that for too long the perceived focus of the peace process has been on the perpetrators.  The time has come to change this and allow the focus to be placed on the innocent victims and those who risked their lives in upholding the rule of law and preserving civil society.  We are asking the committee to support our suggestions and recommendations as to how our specific needs can be dealt with in the areas of truth recovery, justice, support services and recognition and remembrance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Austin Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Stack.

The issue was raised by the speaker for Innocent Victims United in a previous presentation.  This is glaringly obvious and needs to be addressed.  It should have been addressed years ago and why it has not been is something we need to investigate.  It is important that the committee raise this issue now and try to deal with it on behalf of the victims groups, both North and South.  I was interested to hear that contribution because it tied in with what Mr. Donaldson had said during the last session about the comparison between what was available to the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings or members of the security forces in the South and what was available in Northern Ireland, where I know that it is inadequate.  The presentations have made it quite clear that pensions and victim supports in the North are inadequate, but they are non-existent in the Republic.

I received a letter from the Taoiseach yesterday informing us that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, had raised the issue with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers.  The letter goes on to refer to the all-party support in the D&aacute;il for the Ballymurphy families' request for an independent panel.  The request was made, but there is no reflecting on what she is going to do.  We are into the sixth year of a Tory Government.  In all that time the Tory Government has not been serious about addressing these issues and that will continue.  The HIU was going to be legislated for in October, but she is going to hold at ransom until the talks are finished.  We do not really have much faith in the HIU or anything concerning the British state.  The Tory Government's policy on dealing with the past is completely negative, to the point where there is a lack of engagement with the coroner in inquests.  The PSNI and the Ministry of Defence are slowing things down.  For example, the Ministry of Defence was supposed to hand over 33 files from the historical enquiries team, HET.  It was given six weeks - a long time - to deal with redactions and so forth.  We have most of the files already, but six or eight weeks passed and they were not ready.  When the coroner asked why they were not ready, they shrugged their shoulders and just said they were not ready and there was no explanation.  That is how we are being dealt with in the coronial system.  The British Government, the Ministry of Defence and the PSNI are not treating it seriously.<\/p> <p>  Do we engage with other groups?  We do.  I have met most of the people here.  We deal with different sections and some of us are good friends a long time now.<\/p><p>We engage with the likes of the family members of those affected by the Shankill bombing.

We always recognise that their hurt is the same as ours.<\/p><p> I think it was Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan who asked about the Haass talks.  It was put forward by almost all parties at those talks that the legacy inquests, on which I want to focus today, should continue.  When the time came to agree to the Stormont House Agreement in the early hours of the last day, the legacy inquests were attacked.  They would have been done away with if the two Nationalist parties - Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP - had not stood their ground and insisted that this was not a matter for negotiation.  A paragraph in the Agreement states the legacy inquests should be addressed, properly resourced and made compliant with Article 2.

As far as we are concerned, we have come so far down the road the investigation has been ongoing for three years.  I will give an example.  When we met a representative of the PSNI last Wednesday, we were given a complete breakdown of where we were.  Perhaps the committee will understand where I am coming from when I say we should not be involved with the historical investigations unit.  Up until last week, of the 131 soldiers who have been identified as witnesses on the day, 27 are confirmed to be deceased, 55 have declined to engage or are not compellable, 34 have made witness statements and seven others are engaging.  That is the position on the army witnesses.  Of the 953 civilian witnesses who have been identified, 394 have passed away, 239 have declined to assist and 300 statements have been provided.  Nearly 400 of those who witnessed the events of Bloody Sunday have passed away.  I am trying to say we are coming to a point in this fairly indepth investigation at which we might be seeing the end of the journey.  We have been told seven or eight military witnesses have yet to be interviewed.  Some 26 of the 29 shooters are still alive and seven or eight of them will be interviewed under caution from mid-October onwards.  We are looking at the investigation being finalised in a couple of months.<\/p> <p>  It would deplorable if we were slotted into the historical investigations unit.  If we are, we will experience a knock-back, just as we have experienced previously in recent years.  In other words, if there is a possibility that the historical investigations unit will take over, it will need time to re-examine all of the evidence.  That would probably take months.  It might take the unit a couple of years even to decide to look at the investigation into the Bloody Sunday murders.  It is important to us that the investigation not be interfered with in any way.  It should be allowed to run its course as it is nearly complete.  The PSNI has almost completed its work.  We are hoping it will be completed quite soon - perhaps early next year.  Once it is complete, God knows what length of time it will take the PSNI to complete its report.  It might take it a couple of months to do so.  Then the matter will have to go back to the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland which will be responsible for making a decision on whether to prosecute.  If the historical investigations unit steps in and takes over, everything will be put way back.  We do not want that to happen.<\/p> <p>  We are coming up to 44 years since Bloody Sunday.  The families have worked religiously for many years to ensure we come to the end of the journey.  To be truthful, my family and I, like many other families, want prosecutions of the soldiers - the murderers and those who attempted to murder our people that day.  It boils down to one word - justice.  Justice has to be seen to be done.  I will put it this way.  The PSNI murder investigation is the only thing we have.  We believe the PSNI authorities are the only ones who can deliver the end result and we are waiting patiently.  By the way, we are very patient people.  We have been waiting for nearly 44 years, which is a very long time.  We are waiting to see the end of the process and do not want interference from anyone.  It is as simple as that.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about meetings with other groups and so on.  As Mr. Teggart rightly said, we have worked together for many years.  We have worked with many other groups, including the Loughinisland and Ballymurphy groups.  We have been passing on our own experience during the years to the other groups in the hope it will help them to achieve what they have set out to achieve.  We are open to talk to anyone - no matter who he or she is - and pass on our experience to them.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make a point about what is in place for the families.  At the time of Bloody Sunday, no counselling was provided for any of the families - the mammies, daddies and wives - who had lost loved ones that day.  Nothing was done for them; they had to deal with it themselves.  To be truthful, the families get very little, unless we approach people to ask them to help family members.  A group in Derry, C&uacute;namh, has been very helpful duirng the years in counselling and preparing people to move forward in their lives.  All I can say to the committee is that this is an everyday struggle for us.  The sooner we see the end of the process and are able to move on with our lives, the better.  I reiterate that there should be no interference whatsoever from anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1174,"content":"<p>Does Ms Fullerton wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#Y00400","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>I would like to enlighten the committee on the question of the information that has been buried.  I will start with the present day.  Why is the Garda Commissioner refusing to co-operate with the inquiry of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland?  All of the documentation and anything relevant to the ombudsman's investigation is buried.  That sets the context, 25 years after the murder.  From the outset, the Garda authorities have consistently buried any line of inquiry that has been pushed to them from the RUC side.  We would never have known this if the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire, had not set about unravelling all the bits of information coming his way and seriously and earnestly investigating these lines of inquiry.  Every time something has been provided by the RUC during the years, there has been no response from the Garda in the South.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been extremely reluctant to communicate with the Fullerton family.  A reinvestigation that commenced in 2004 reported in an interim way in 2006.  The document with which we were presented on that day was unacceptable.  We were told not to make it public at the time, but I am more than happy to table it and make it public now.  It was shambolic.  The key witness statement was totally disregarded.<\/p> <p>  On the night of the murder, a member of the media who was well versed on all of the issues in Northern Ireland and who reported on them witnessed something that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland now defines as triable and indictable.  That was completely disregarded.  It stirred enough interest on the day of the murder that he was visited by a chief superintendent on the RUC side and the Garda side.  He was interviewed in a car parked outside his home.  That information was never followed up.  We were never told about it.  On the night of the murder, this witness saw three men at the scene where the getaway car was burned out.  He saw them being picked up and driven away.  We did not know about this until he approached my family in 2003 when he informed my brother of what he had seen.  He has since provided seven statements for various people, including in the Garda in its reinvestigation, our legal team and the ombudsman's inquiry.  Having interviewed this witness and applied the correct protocol for witness statement-taking, the ombudsman is satisfied that he did see what he says he saw on the night of the murder.  The ombudsman's investigation has also identified a member of the RUC who was at the scene of the burned-out car and corroborates what the witness has said about what happened on the night in question.  That is just one small example.<\/p><p> The ombudsman unveiled how in 1991 a team of garda&iacute; travelled to the North to meet the RUC team to be informed at a formal meeting in a police station in the North.  I know the name of the police station.  I am very concerned about saying too much because there is an ongoing and live wider investigation which I do not want to compromise.  At that meeting, the ballistics relating to the murder of Eddie Fullerton were discussed and linked to a recent murder in the North at the time.  That was never followed through.  There were suspects and arrests relating to that murder.<\/p><p> This all happened prior to the inquest.  The inquest was then called at short notice on 19 December 1991.  One member of my family was contacted by the Garda and that member had the responsibility of gathering us into a community hospital.  There were no witnesses that I can remember at that inquest.  We had never suffered a murder like this before.  We were an ordinary family from Donegal and we did not realise we could have legal representation.  We did not realise that the inquest should have been about much more than the injuries sustained by Eddie Fullerton.  We did not realise about the ballistics or the significant witness statements, etc.  That is another example of serious information being buried.<\/p><p> The number of statements taken at the time of my father's murder was minimal and they were confined largely to family and others.  I think there were approximately 120 statements until the re-investigation, when the number went up again.  There was nothing meaningful ever taken.  On record, that key witness statement amounted to 300 words and he does not remember signing it.<\/p><p> We have been told time and again about the RUC informing the Garda about significant information it had about potential suspects for the murder, and with good reason.  That seems to have fallen into a black hole.  There is no record of any kind of follow-up.  In 1993, after a high-level atrocity, a significant witness came forward.  There was a high-level meeting between the RUC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the names of suspects were again passed over.  That was not followed up.  The important aspect of that was that we, specifically as a family, had heard in the media about this potential link and my mother went to the Garda superintendent and asked for those suspects to be interviewed.  We were told in a follow-up meeting by a detective that those witnesses had been questioned and they had nothing to do with anything.  She was told it would be in her best interests not to pursue the matter.  We know that those suspects were never questioned about Eddie Fullerton's murder.<\/p><p> Going back to 2013, the ombudsman again uncovered a significant new line of inquiry, which was again furnished through the PSNI to the Garda.  We have had no contact from the Garda and even then the Garda has indicated it will not co-operate with the police ombudsman investigation.  The lack of co-operation by the Garda and the lack of willingness to meet the ombudsman's team provides verification for our family and vindicates everything we have said all along.  The Garda in this State, for some reason, is not interested in investigating Eddie Fullerton's assassination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Amanda Fullerton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Smith's question first as to whether our group has spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or officials in the Department with respect to the Stormont House Agreement.  Before the group was formed, I had a private meeting with the Minister about four weeks after the Stormont House Agreement was signed.  When I read the document initially, I was quite worried about the issue of victims being able to meet the people providing the evidence or the perpetrators.  Some victims would not feel capable of sitting down with the perpetrators, although in my case I would have no problem doing that.  The way the Stormont House Agreement was drafted, it raised concerns that we would not be able to get that level of engagement.  I got specific assurances from the Minister at that meeting that this would not be the case and we would be able to engage with the people who gathered the information and, if we so wished, with the perpetrators.  I emphasised that this process needed to be done in public in some fashion, although I realise there would be great difficulty in how that could be managed.  It is managed in South Africa in a way and there could be negotiations on how this could be done in public.  In our view, to instil confidence and credibility, there would have to be some public element in how the information is given to victims.  Victims must be able to test the evidence and information given to them.<\/p> <p>  In my specific case, when I met a representative of the IRA with Gerry Adams in 2013, there was one particular piece of the evidence given to me that I knew to be untrue and I was able to question the person about that and test what was being said.  It was quite powerful from my perspective to be able to do that.  In a forum like a proper truth recovery process in an official Government-backed process, we must be able to do it.  That would give us and the public a sense of credibility about the issue.<\/p> <p>  When I was preparing for this, I spoke to many families and particularly relations of garda&iacute; murdered during the Troubles.  One family was quite upset and I was asked to bring to the committee that this garda's family had seen no recognition or medal for the murdered individual.  The person was blown up with a bomb and his family is quite upset that no medal has been awarded to him.  It is a simple issue for a family to get recognition, but 40 years later it still has not been done.  As Deputy Smith mentioned, a national memorial could be quite easily done.  It would not break the bank or offend anybody.  For the 14 members of the State's forces and the many civilians - it would include the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and individuals like Tom Oliver, who were murdered during the Troubles - the families should have some sense of the State recognising and remembering their loss.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Haass proposals and the Stormont House Agreement, in the meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he agreed to take on board what I said.  I specifically indicated that, in the Haass proposals, the victims and community groups in Northern Ireland would be allowed to have input into the structures and organisation, including how they would work.  We are concerned that the Stormont House Agreement, especially with respect to the independent commission for information retrieval, has structures comprising only political people.  They are representatives of political parties, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  Documents have been leaked in recent weeks on how families will be given a heavily redacted document, with no chance to engage, and that would not have happened if the Haass proposals had been implemented.  The victims would have had input into the structure of the organisation at the very start.  From that perspective, we are not happy at all with the way the commission has been set up.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about consultation with other groups.<\/p><p>My group has had some contact - not a lot of contact - with other groups.  Individually, before we formed the group, I had a bit of contact with some of the groups.  I found it interesting that the Victims and Survivors Service in Northern Ireland will deal with me as an individual but it will not deal with my group as a group.  I can get an award as an individual from the Victims and Survivors Service in Northern Ireland to the value of &pound;500, but the group cannot get any support and there are no supports in this jurisdiction.  This is the reason for the suggestion that one victims and survivors group should be allowed to help, support and fund the individual groups in the Republic, the North and the UK.  That would be something we would suggest very strongly because at the moment it is very haphazard.  There are very few groups.  I am only aware of one other group representing victims in the South.  We are only at the start of the process but we have had some engagement.<\/p><p> On not being consulted on the Good Friday Agreement, I will give the Deputy an example of how this affected us.  On the day of the prisoner releases from Long Kesh, I had a day off work and I was looking at Sky News.  I saw all the flag waving with people coming out and partying and whatnot.  I immediately thought of my mother.  I got in my car and I drove to Portlaoise to my mother.  She was sitting in the front room of the house bawling her eyes out, seeing these terrorists out celebrating and yahooing and partying.  That had an extremely bad effect on my mother that day.  The Good Friday Agreement is perceived rightly or wrongly to be very perpetrator-centred and not victim-centred.  The perpetrators seem to have been the ones who got all the gains and the victims were never consulted.  The simple thing would have been for the victims to have been consulted and we would have told the governments that if they were going to do prisoner releases, which we realise would have to be done, they should do it in a low-key, staggered fashion.  It would have been as simple as that and it would have meant that many people would not have been upset.<\/p><p> That is just something simple.  It could have been done quite easily in the South because there are only 14 families of State forces concerned in the South.  They would have been quite easily contactable by the Government at the time.  There were also the civilian victims, but again there are not that many.  We are not a body of people who are hard to get.  People know where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Austin Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Stack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#AA00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1180,"content":"<p>The common theme from all the witnesses is that they are all asking why.

The witnesses are asking why they would not investigate.  The witnesses said it was because of State collusion with agents in the North, that for the groups the witnesses represent it is because it is recognition that there was a war, conflict or whatever.  In both cases it comes across as really incompetent.  Is it deliberate incompetence?<\/p> <p>  In Ms Fullerton's situation, was there follow through on forensic evidence in the house?  I am aware that her house had annexes and so on, but these people seemed to know exactly where to go.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the group Mr. Stack represents, garda&iacute; were investigating members of the Garda who were killed, yet he is saying they did what they did deliberately even at that time.  Is it similar to the case of Eddie Fullerton in that evidence went missing?  It was lax, incompetent and so on.  This is the first time I have heard any of this, so I am not aware of it.  I am aware of them in the Fullerton case because again the families have briefed us and so on.  I think the witness is right about the victims not being more involved in the negotiations leading up to the peace process.  However, I do not know if we would have got an agreement if victims had been centrally involved in it.  I think that all those different groups were coming together and bringing their own constituency forward and so on.  It might not have happened.  I am surmising; I do not know.  I think the Unionists would have huge problems bringing victims in.  I think they were forces that were out there.<\/p> <p>  We are listening to what the witnesses are saying on some of the things that need to be done.

As a former member of Donegal County Council, I wish to start by asking Ms Fullerton a question.  I remember when sitting in the chamber in Lifford seeing Eddie Fullerton's picture looking down on the chamber.  It is hard to believe that 25 years later we still have no answers regarding the investigation.  What she has related today about the investigation is very stark.  Does she see any potential for any historical investigations-type unit in the South to get answers about Eddie Fullerton's assassination for her and her family just to see what kind of process could be developed in the South?  Does she believe that would help or does she believe that co-operation with the ombudsman in the North is the way to go?  How could we progress it in the South?<\/p> <p>  For Mr. Stack and the victims group we may have an opportunity in the South to go further than what is envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement.  How could we develop that and go forward in terms of recognising victims and dealing with historical cases?  Perhaps we should look at that in the South as a way of highlighting the differences.  Perhaps by doing things properly here if the will is here, we might be able to highlight how things can row back in the Six Counties in particular.<\/p> <p>  I am very struck by the presentations of Mr. Teggart and Mr. Kelly.  The Ballymurphy families hope that the historical investigations unit might provide an opportunity, but then when one looks at how that will probably row back in terms of legislation over the next couple of months, that is one of the most disappointing things.  We have the Stormont House Agreement which is supposed to be an international agreement and then we get legislation that is supposed to come from that that will be watered down and probably rowed back on through the process in Westminster.  Do the witnesses have faith that it will deliver for them?<\/p> <p>  In the case of the Bloody Sunday families I believe there is a very real risk that they could be forced into the HIU process as well.  I think it gives a very stark outline of the risks involved and the potential for slippage on all these processes as well.  Every agreement seems to be an attempt to push things forward and nothing is really happening in terms of progressing things for victims and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#AA00400","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>What comes across to me in all of this is the lack of truth and the lack of justice.<\/p><p>In most cases there was no investigation or poor investigation, and certainly no truth has come out of all of that.  We see so many similarities between what we are talking about here and so many other cases that I am aware of.  I know Ms Anne Cadwallader is presenting, and her book itemises a number of those.<\/p><p> In regard to Bloody Sunday particularly, it highlights the fact that whenever one gets an agreement from the British Government at the highest level that there was murder, one does not get speedy investigation of it.  I am sure the investigation of those murders did not actually start after that agreement.  Three years on from that, however, and we are 44 years on form the events.  The investigation is very old in that situation.  The information required could have been given almost immediately but that speedy approach is lacking..<\/p><p> It also seems to show a lack of collective responsibility on the part of both governments.  If one looks at all of the cases here, either in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and Cavan and all the different bombings that happened, there was no release of information from the Irish Government that it was aware there was collusion or participation of British forces.  It brings into question the point of either agreements or inquiries because it all seems to be merely a delaying tactic to get it until as many as possible are deceased and are no longer there to be interviewed.<\/p><p> From the witnesses' point of view, what is, I suppose, the conclusion that they would come to?  How does one put this into a truth commission?  Mr. Stack referred to the South African situation but that was different because there was a conclusion with the Government opening up, whereas here we do not have that, even in regard to Dublin-Monaghan.<\/p><p> It is significant that no members of the security forces in the North have served a day for any of the incidents involved. Very few have even been questioned or charged.  I am not certain what the situation is otherwise.  The protection of citizens would seem to be the responsibility of both governments and that is a failure that has happened across the board.<\/p><p> In Ms Fullerton's case, in regard to the murder of Eddie Fullerton, who I knew on the council and during the whole politics of it, the very fact that an RUC man and a garda could quiz someone amounted to a hijacking.  It was holding somebody under false arrest, yet none of those persons were charged with that.  It is not unusual - it is certainly no surprise to me - that a member of the RUC was seen at the scene of the car being burned out because that seems to be a regular changeover or transfer that happened so many times.<\/p><p> The big issue we have in regard to the Good Friday Agreement, the release of prisoners or all of these things, is that the detail required to deal with them is lacking.  The Agreement was made but it seems the first issue, from both governments' point of view, is how does one break it - where are the loopholes, how does one get out of it and how does one fail to implement the Agreement.  What is the witnesses' solution to how we can bring this forward?  Perhaps it is a question of more committees and more investigations.  They will not deliver anything different to what has already been there previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Molloy.

Deputy Crowe asks why would they not investigate.  Although it was for some of the other witnesses, it really covers ourselves as well.  From 1971 until now, there has never been any police investigation into the deaths of 11 civilians in Ballymurphy.  At the time, the only input from the RUC was to take photographs in the morgue.  That was their only input.  At the inquest in 1972, any eye-witnesses' account that they had got from the British Army were handed over in a brown envelop, including their ciphered names.  The British Army was not cross-examined at the time.  Its statements were taken in good faith.<\/p> <p>  In our new inquest, we got disclosure of their redacted statements that were taken at the time.  One example of that would have been the shooting of Eddie Doherty, who was shot in the back on 10 August 1971.  The soldier's statement was that he had fired one, aimed and shot at a petrol bomber, but his real statement, which we have got hold of through our legal representative, showed he emptied the magazine.  He fired over 30 rounds into the crowd and Eddie Doherty was shot in the back.  He had just left his family in Turf Lodge, checking that they were okay with what had happened the night before with my father.  Five other civilians, including a Catholic priest, Fr. Hugh Mullan, and a mother of eight, Ms Joan Connolly, were murdered.<\/p> <p>  I merely bring back to the committee the close proximity of what happened there.  The Taoiseach stood exactly where my father was murdered.  My father was shot 14 times as he lay on the ground.  When I brought the Taoiseach to where my father was murdered in that incident, the Taoiseach stood at the spot and he looked across the road, because the width of the road is all the distance there was to where the 85 paratroopers were positioned.  Maybe some of whom were the same ones involved in Bloody Sunday six months later.  The Taoiseach stood there and he looked across, and said, \"John, that is 25 yards.\", and I replied, \"I know.\"  In addition, it was a bright summer's night.  There was no justification for murdering any of these civilians.  There was no follow-up forensics.  There were no bullets.  The swabs on their hands in the morgue came up all negative on involvement with any arms or gunfire.  That is the investigation that we have had.  Right up until today, as I stated earlier, succeeding chief constables refused to meet us and directed us to the Secretary of State.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Molloy asked what was our solution to or mechanism for this area.  The inquests are good.  As I stated earlier, they continue to be brought down due to resources.  They are jam-packed and at present, they cannot work with their resources.  There are supposed to be investigators for the coroners' courts.  It has been asked for from the Attorney General in England and it still has not been put in place.  They cannot go on the way they are.  They need the resources and proper management to go through what we need, which is a proper inquest.<\/p> <p>  Our solution, as in the all-party motion in the D&aacute;il this year, was an independent panel.  It has been tried and tested by the Hillsborough families.  It is cost-effective.  We have brought it down to a cost of less than &euro;0.5 million.  To put it in perspective, it costs &pound;40,000 for one night's security in north Belfast around the Twaddell camp.  The policing for one night costs &pound;40,000.  If one adds that up over two weeks, it would more than cover investigating the deaths of 11 civilians in Ballymurphy.  That is our solution.  That is what we have put forward, but it was denied.  As I say, it has been brought up recently with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Although the Government has been helpful and the Taoiseach fulfilled all his obligations for us, we need a proactive approach from the British Government, which, at present, is a Tory Government, to be really serious about dealing with the past.  The British Government's record to date has been pathetic.  We also need a proactive approach from the Irish Government, as an equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>It must push forward on behalf of victims like ourselves and others.  We need justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>Regarding our case, we had the campaign up and running.  The Irish Government was very helpful.  We had the help of John Bruton and Bertie Ahern, who came on board.  They produced a report that destroyed the Widgery report.  That certainly helped us in getting a brand new inquiry.  We had it in 2010.  I am sorry - the Saville inquiry was announced in 1998.  Out of that came the full vindication of all of our people.<\/p> <p>  Truth commissions have been mentioned many times, but the Bloody Sunday inquiry led by Lord Saville was a truth commission.  The soldiers who committed the atrocity had the opportunity to tell the truth.  Things were put in place.  For example, they had partial immunity from prosecution whereby they could not implicate themselves if they admitted to the murder of any of the victims of that day, but they did not take that opportunity.  Everyone must participate, come forward and give the truth of his or her actions.  In our experience of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, that did not happen.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the murder investigation, our belief is that the day after Lord Saville produced his report, the soldiers should have been arrested and prosecuted.  Lord Saville found the truth of what happened that day, that murder happened on our streets.  It is like everything else, though.  It is out of our hands and we must go with the process.  The Public Prosecution Service, PPS, decided to consider the report and advised the PSNI to set up a murder investigation.  Believe it or not, prior to the Saville inquiry, there was never an RUC or PSNI murder investigation into Bloody Sunday.  The reason we were given for this was that the then RUC and the British army made a deal over tea and biscuits that the army would investigate its soldiers while the RUC investigated civilians.  In other words, Bloody Sunday was pushed under the carpet to protect the murders and the people who planned the operation.<\/p> <p>  I know the soldier who murdered my brother.  I will not tell members his name, but he is known as soldier F.  Soldier F murdered my brother.  We know this because the bullet that killed Michael entered his stomach and embedded itself in his spine.  As far as I am concerned, soldier F should have been arrested straight after Lord Saville made his report.  Soldier F murdered four people in total that day.  He was given the opportunity to tell the truth through the Bloody Sunday inquiry and what it had put in place to allow him to tell the truth.  Truth gathering in the North would be difficult, particularly given the fact that, when people got an opportunity within an inquiry to tell the truth without incriminating themselves, they did not take it.  For me, a truth commission is out.  It would never happen.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the victims, I have never been asked what I want by anyone.  My family has never been asked.  Thousands of families have never been asked what they want.  There are people sitting down and making decisions on our behalf.  That is not right.  We should have an input into what happens to our future and what should be done to help families get through what they are experiencing now.<\/p> <p>  It is 44 years since Bloody Sunday and many people have died.  My mother and father are dead.  All of the mammies and daddies have passed away.  Half of the injured have died.  One of the wives passed away last year.  This is the situation as far as we are concerned.  Including the historical investigations unit, HIU, will take another five years.  They are waiting for people to die and then the problem will be resolved.  That is how many of us see it.  It is a question of time - wait, wait, wait and die, die, die.  There will be no one left to answer to.  Even the soldiers who committed the atrocity on Bloody Sunday will die some day.  Hopefully not before my time, because I want to see soldier F in a court of law being prosecuted for my brother's death.  If they keep putting things back, though, that will not be the situation.  There will be no one left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>Regarding Deputy Crowe's question about incompetence in the Garda, I would love to think that it was incompetence, but I firmly believe that it was not. Our experience has been more like contempt and complicity.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a robust cross-Border liaison process between the RUC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I had the Ombudsman's team investigate this matter for me to confirm what I already knew.  Border liaison officers met on a monthly or weekly basis to deal with counter-insurgency issues, etc.  They shared information on a formal and regular basis.  I know who the Border officers for Donegal and Derry were.<\/p> <p>  There was a high-profile murder or assassination in the north west.  The liaising was still happening and information was passing back and forth.  The ombudsman is going to great lengths to uncover the exact level of information exchange.  He is of the Northern Ireland authority, but this matter is incumbent on the Government of Ireland and the Garda, which has never been proactive in pursuing an investigation even at those times when the RUC pushed information in its direction.  There were formal meetings, but the result was a blank.  The issue was buried and went nowhere and the Garda turned a blind eye.<\/p> <p>  For us in north-west Donegal, this was happening to the backdrop of the Morris tribunal atrocities.  A team of garda&iacute; operating out of Buncrana in Donegal proactively and clandestinely buried arms caches, etc.  They were subsequently investigated.  I know that at least four of those who were indicted for being liars and corrupt by the Morris tribunal are key to the Eddie Fullerton investigation.  It comes as no surprise that the investigation was proactively buried.  I request that the Irish authorities get to the bottom of this.  For some reason, this was allowed to happen in the case of Eddie Fullerton.  It continues to happen.<\/p> <p>  I am grateful to the Ombudsman's inquiry in the North for digging deep into this matter and doing what it could to find out the extent and nature of the information that was provided to the Garda.  At least that has established for my family for the first time some evidence that this issue did not die on both sides of the Border.  Some sort of an investigation was ongoing.  People were trying to uncover aspects of the assassination.  We have a Garda that does not want to follow through with an investigation to this day and some committed members of the PSNI who are doing their job and providing information.  We also have Border liaison officers who meet regularly.  We now know that key information was exchanged at some of those meetings.<\/p> <p>  This is ongoing and forms part of the wider investigation that will conclude this year.  I cannot say much about everything that I know, but we had a good and positive meeting with the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 2006.  He assured us that there would be maximum co-operation from the Garda, his team and the North.  My mother wrote to Tony Blair.  She received a reply from Paul Goggins assuring her that there would be no problems and that there would be a streamlined facilitation of information exchange across the Border.  For the first time, we believed that we had a green light to get real work done.<\/p> <p>  Any feedback that we received from the Garda, particularly in 1993, was to the effect that the Border presented a problem.<\/p><p>We now know that it never presented a problem; it just depended on who the victim was.  I would say the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was complicit in some way in the flawed investigation that followed the murder of Eddie Fullerton.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Pringle for his kind words about my father.  We did have an investigative review and quite a few resources were thrown at it.  I remember that at the time, in 2003 and 2004, teams of detectives were flown up to Donegal to go over and dig into the investigation.  It was meant to be a review of the original investigation.  After that dried up and after some campaigning, we received a report in 2006.  This is the interim review to which I refer.  The interim review was flawed from the outset.  My father's name was misspelled on the front of it, for a start.  As we mulled our way through the pages, we became so disappointed.  It was half a page with double spacing.  I have seen so many proper, thorough investigative reports, but this particular one was unacceptable.  It is the kindest word I can say about it.<\/p><p> What did jump out from the review was a bit of information about ballistics about which we had never been told.  Even though we knew there were convictions regarding this ballistic link to 13 other murders in the North, I had to query the detective chief superintendent and ask whether a follow-up interview with the people who were convicted was requested, but it was not.  I asked whether this would be done on our behalf and I was told it would be.  This is the experience I have had with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I visited Harcourt Street three times.  After the meeting with Bertie Ahern, he appointed an assistant commissioner, whom I met three times at Harcourt Street.  I drove those meetings.  There was no proactive interplay.  It was a case of me minuting them and following up the next time on whether they had followed through.  To this day we have not received a report from that.<\/p><p> An historical investigation unit in the South would not work for my family.

From our view, it is more than incompetence and poor Garda techniques.  Approximately three weeks ago I sat down with four different families, and three of the cases were extremely similar in terms of how hard material evidence went missing, eyewitnesses were not asked to take part in identification parades, give statements or come to court, and fingerprints went missing.  We represent a small group of people, perhaps 20 families, and when four of them sat down together we found that three of them had had very similar experiences in the 1970s and 1980s.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe there was specific collusion, but I believe that perhaps individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Prison Service were supportive of the IRA.  Deputy Ferris mentions this in his autobiography.  He states that members of the Prison Service in Portlaoise were supportive of the IRA at the time.  We know that was there.  I believe the Government did not want to open up this can of worms because if it had to go there it would have seen that individuals in State agencies and forces were supportive of the IRA.<\/p> <p>  Several of our cases have been to the serious crime review team, which is the cold case unit, and we have all had similar experiences.  We found it to be a complete waste of time.  Garda&iacute; who are investigating garda&iacute; and what happened back in the 1970s and 1980s do not want to be seen to cast aspersions on the investigations of their colleagues.  We are taking this up in a legal forum in some of our cases.  With regard to answers and solutions, there is a requirement for a public inquiry - I do not know whether it should be collective - into how some of the investigations were conducted by the Garda at the time.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what Deputy Pringle said on the public nature of truth commissions and the truth recovery process, most of those in our group have suffered public denials.  Certain individuals or groupings carried out the murders of our relatives and loved ones.  We have had to suffer in public with these denials.  If the truth is going to come it must come in public.

A biography was written about me and I certainly did not say to anybody that there were people in the Prison Service or the Garda who were supportive of the IRA.  What I said was that there were people in both organisations who were humane, as there were other people in those organisations who were inhumane.<\/p><p>There have been victims of the conflict across this island and beyond.  Maybe the reason there was conflict was that victims were created by a system, by a state, through discrimination, sectarianism, inequality and wrongs across the whole system.  The most disgraceful thing of all is collusion by states who are obliged to protect citizens.<\/p><p> I would say very strongly in relation to the killing of Ms Fullerton's father that there was collusion and that it was covered up afterwards.  That is very evident.  If one looks at this State, probably the thing that jumps out at me most is that when people such as the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four were imprisoned for up to 15 or 16 years, the State lobbied internationally against people who were highlighting the injustices of their imprisonment.  That is what the State did in America and beyond.  It went out of its way to lobby against people who tried to get justice for people who were wrongfully imprisoned.<\/p><p> For truth to emerge and come to the surface, the example has to come from states.  It has to come from an honest endeavour to create a framework allowing people to obtain justice.  To date, that has not been forthcoming.  The British State, in particular, has so much to hide in relation to its involvement in collusion, including its involvement in Bloody Sunday and the Ballymurphy Massacre, as well as many other areas in the North in which it was actively involved in killing people indiscriminately because they happened to be Nationalist, Catholic or whatever.  If the State is prepared to purge the wrongs of its past, that would help in many ways to open up a whole truth and reconciliation process, but it has to lead by example.    <\/p><p> I am a Republican and I have been part of the conflict.  I am one of more than 20,000 people of my persuasion who have been through the prison system as a result of the conflict.  However, I am prepared openly to say what is right and proper in regard to truth and reconciliation, because that is the only way all of us will get justice.  If that does not happen and people engage in covering things up, then individuals will cover up and will continue to cover up for their own reasons.  For people who are involved in politics, having been involved in organisations that were involved in the conflict, there is an obligation on all of us to do everything we can to get justice for the victims and survivors as well as honouring the memory of those who lost their lives throughout that conflict.  That is the way I see it happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#DD00900","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are running out of time, so I will ask Senator Daly to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#EE00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave, but I had to deal with legislation in the Seanad.  I heard the initial contributions on Ballymurphy and Bloody Sunday.  I was in Belfast during the summer and met Kevin Winters and his legal team.  I was inside his office and saw his filing cabinets, which contain the history of the Northern Troubles ranging from Bloody Sunday to collusion, from murders by the British army to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I said to him that I hoped he had copies of his files, because there is no doubt that somebody somewhere would like to make his files disappear as well.  On my trip I also saw the murals about Ballymurphy and the horrific story of Joan Connolly, who was shot in the face while walking, shot again at point blank range and died, leaving behind eight children.  That human story, and the other stories, tell us that justice must be given to the 57 children who were left without a parent.<\/p> <p>  One of the most telling documents that I have come across in recent times was uncovered by the BBC's \"Panorama\" programme and related to two civil servants who stated that the Prime Minister was anxious that the next unit should operate within the law.  That comment was in relation to what are best described as murder gangs, who were British soldiers dressed up in civilian clothing who drove around west Belfast and shot citizens or civilians.  It is quite clear that the British Prime Minister knew that the previous incarnation of the Military Reaction Force operated outside the law, because one would not have to ask that the new unit operate within the law if one understood that the previous unit had operated within the law.  That shows how high up corruption went in the political system.<\/p> <p>  The British ambassador has often attended the House for motions in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and elsewhere in regard to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I have asked him, and asked some of the people who like to attend the British ambassador's tea party to ask him, for the files.  If I was a country that had been accused of the biggest mass murder in the history of this State, I would like to clear my name.  In such a case I would give every file I had and say that we had nothing to do with it, but we all know that the contrary is most likely true.<\/p> <p>  It is 18 years since the Good Friday Agreement and here we are.  I agree with Mr. John Kelly that the powers that be are waiting for people to die.  They are winding out the clock and hoping that not only will the families die off but the perpetrators will die off without ever seeing the inside of a courthouse.  That is basically what the Governments are saying.  Mr. Kevin Winters said to me that one in three of the victims in the North were killed either by the loyalist paramilitaries or by the British army.  The loyalist paramilitaries could not have existed without the assistance and support of the British State, through either a consistent policy or a policy that was nodding agreement.  That is a terrible indictment.  It sounds like South America.  We hear about murder gangs in South America during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and that is essentially what was happening in the North of Ireland.  What they want to happen is for the files to be released on some bright and breezy day in 50 years' time, thus ensuring that justice never comes for the victims' organisations present and the other organisations.  We must have justice, because there are thousands of victims, and I refer not only to those who lost loved ones.  I believe future generations will also be victims, because they suffered the trauma through their parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#EE00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time and suggest that we wind up shortly.

Cover-ups and agents still exist today.  I agree with what Senator Daly has said about the agents.  It was the British State who ran paramilitary organisations and there was collusion by state agents.  Statistics indicate that only 350 people were murdered by the British state during the Troubles, which represents 10% of the fatalities, but it had a greater impact.  The loyalist organisations were run, managed, armed, secured and financed by the British State, which would increase that percentage of fatalities to 40%.  The British State has been involved in killings through collusion, supporting paramilitary organisations and the rest.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Ferris has suggested that one should lead by example.  That is the way things should be, but I have no faith in the British State leading by example.  The Taoiseach has called for the files on the killing of ten innocent civilians in a van in Kingsmill.  He has said that he would co-operate and do all in his power to get the files released.  I do not know whether he has done so, but he has said to us that he is leading by example.  Let us hope that the British State will listen and come through for us.<\/p><p> I will finish off with a point about the historical investigations unit, HIU, and the Ballymurphy families.  I will reserve judgment on the matter.  It will be a long time before any conclusion.  As Mr. Kelly has said, our witnesses are dying and those who carried out the murders are dying.  This tactic has been used along the way.  Anyway, for people like ourselves - it applies to the Bloody Sunday families as well - there are younger people and the next generation to consider.  They are asking questions and they are going to carry on the campaign.  It is not only for me.  We need to get answers for the next generation and bring to a conclusion what we have been campaigning for all these years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#EE00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Teggart","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris asked us to comment on state truth.  We had one of the most infamous examples of a state cover-up, namely, the Widgery tribunal in 1972.  It certainly suited the British Government at the time that the Widgery tribunal was put in place to deliver that untruth about Bloody Sunday.  He produced a cover-up that was welcomed by the British Government at the time.  That remained the case for many years, but the families never gave up.  Eventually, we forced the British to reopen the case and we then got the Saville inquiry.  Having said that, in the case of the Saville inquiry we never got the full truth - this was pointed out earlier.  We never did and we probably never will because of the way the British state works.  Those involved protect their own people before they will admit to the murder of innocent people.  It is as simple as that.  Those responsible in the British state wrote the book on cover-ups.  They know how to do it and they will employ it many times in future as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1205,"content":"<p>I will leave the committee with one thought.  In 2006 we were assured, at the highest level in this Government, by the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Goggins, maximum co-operation to facilitate this murder investigation.  That was nine years ago.  We made a little headway after that but then there was no communication from the Garda.  The reason the force has given information to the police Ombudsman now is that it is an open investigation.  It has been an open investigation all along.  I believe that this is an unacceptable excuse for a lack of co-operation, as does our legal team and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  I am keen for some earnest thought to be given to questioning this reasoning or rationale by the Garda authorities.  I would like to leave this room with some serious attempt to get to the bottom of what happened in Donegal and why the Garda was not instructed to conduct a proper investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amanda Fullerton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having us in today.

If we can be of any help, that is what we are here to do.  Mr. Kelly, you referred to the ongoing PSNI murder investigations and the historical investigations unit.

Perhaps you can talk to me afterwards.

I have been CEO of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation for the past two years.  For those who do not know it, the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation was founded in 1974 as a response by people from the Republic to the violence that was predominantly happening in Northern Ireland and seeking ways to help stop that violence.<\/p><p>As our name, Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, suggests, peace-building and reconciliation are things we believe in and which are core to our mission statement and our vision for the future of this island.  Building a lasting peace, ensuring political violence can never return and having a reconciled society are very important to us.  It is in that context that I am making my remarks.  The role we have played for over 40 years is to act as an impartial, non-judgmental facilitator of dialogue, allowing difficult conversations to take place between people with very different views and opinions about the political situation on this island and how we deal with legacy issues of the past and whatever other contentious issues arise.  That is still the role we play today.<\/p><p> I was able to rearrange my diary to spend all day here to listen to what other groups had to say.  Now is the time - and we cannot delay any longer - to deal with legacy issues from our violent past.  It has gone on too long.  It is very difficult to do, both politically and for those who are involved, be they State or non-State actors, but we have to resolve issues from the past.  That has been clear from listening to individual families and groups talking about the difficulties and the obstacles they face in dealing with the past and how they are making no progress.  However, as a wider society across this island, North and South, we have to deal with the past, which also involves Britain.<\/p><p> Truth and justice are required.  People require information, acknowledgement and recognition for the suffering they have experienced.  Glencree has learned over 40 years that dealing with the past is fundamental to building peace.  I suspect everyone in this room wishes for a lasting peace.  Time will not be sufficient to heal the wounds and help reconciliation.  Trauma is passed intergenerationally and, as other witnesses said earlier, even if we just wait for people to die, other generations will pick up the baton and ask for peace, justice, acknowledgement and recognition.  We have to deal with this.  It is difficult for all of us but we have to find the courage to make it happen.<\/p><p> A second point I want to make relates to hidden legacies.  Quite rightly, we hear a bit - and perhaps not enough - about individual victims and how families and groups have suffered.  However, we may not remind ourselves often enough of the hidden legacies, such as alcoholism, dependence on prescription drugs, suicide, mental health problems and so on.  These affect a far wider group of people and effectively result in a collective trauma and in coping mechanisms that are not healthy for society.  We cannot forget these hidden legacies.  If someone commits suicide because of what he or she lived through in his or her community, not because he or she was directly affected by the violence but because he or she saw it around himself or herself, who is to say that his or her family has suffered any less than some other family that was directly affected?  I cannot say that.  These hidden legacies are part of the issues we need to deal with and which we cannot ignore.<\/p><p> The third point I want to make relates to a question of silence.  Given the title, I am a bit nervous mentioning this.  Another legacy we have from our violent past is violence.  The position with regard to violence is considerably better and the level of violence is considerably less than it was.  I do not wish to claim it is anything like the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.  However, there is still violence in communities.  People are expelled, there are punishments, there is domestic abuse, there is sexual abuse - the list goes on.  It is not acceptable.  That is a legacy issue we are dealing with.  The continuing violence is not named.  Most people I speak to know this happens, know where it happens, probably know who is doing it and who is doing the threatening, but we do not name it.  How can we, as a society, politically, name the unnameable without destabilising the massive progress we have made since 1998 and before?  There is no doubt that we have made significant progress.  This is also a very important legacy issue we have to grapple with.  It makes it more difficult and more complicated, but we have to face up to it.<\/p><p> In whatever mechanisms are agreed upon to deal with the past, if that phrase is acceptable, or to deal with legacy issues, we would strongly argue that informal truth-recovery processes can be an important part of a jigsaw or a suite of options.  What I mean by that is that, sadly in many cases, justice, in terms of a day in court and prosecutions, is not possible.  Information recovery is catered for in the Stormont House Agreement but it would risk being soulless - \"Here is a piece of paper after an investigation has been done that tells you some of what happened\".  It has been evident throughout the day that these issues are about emotions, soul, heart, suffering, people and human beings.  Pieces of paper with lines in black do not really hit the mark.  I am not saying everything needs to be informal, but informal truth recovery processes are an important part.  Glencree has done some of this work in the past and we are committed to doing it in the future.  I stress that it is all very much on a voluntary basis.  If someone who has suffered wishes to engage with a group or someone who has caused harm then we would be very willing to help that happen in a humane way.  The benefit of this is that it can allow for information and truth, or multiple truths, to emerge but it can also result in genuine acknowledgement, genuine understanding, hearing and recognition.  Acknowledgement and recognition have been asked for quite a lot today.  It can also potentially result in healing and reconciliation.  I am not saying it is a silver bullet because this is by no means the case, but it is part of a suite of options that need to be pursued and, therefore, it must be supported, which requires resources.<\/p><p> I have two final points.  I think Mr. Stack has already made this one for me and Ms Joly may also make it.  The perception is out there that victims, or those who wish to call themselves victims, from the Republic and Great Britain are somehow less important, less well catered for or less supported than those in Northern Ireland.  I do not know whether that is actually true but that perception exists and we need to be very wary of it.  I wanted to raise that given that this is a predominantly Republic of Ireland committee.<\/p><p> My final point is a broader one.  We are guilty in the Republic of Ireland of ignoring Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the exceptions are some of the people in this room.  We are guilty of saying \"Nothing to do with us\" or \"I'm not interested\".  To Glencree, that is not good enough.  The peace process is an all-island issue and an all-islands issue.  It is an issue for these islands.  We are a bit guilty down here of saying \"This is not our issue.  That is up to them and we should let them resolve it.\"  That is not to say that we should be meddling in another state's affairs, but the Republic could play a much more supportive and encouraging role as guarantor of the peace process than it does.  That would be just as relevant for legacy issues as it is for any other tricky matter in the peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Devas","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1212,"content":"<p>Myself and Mr. O'Connor of the Pat Finucane Centre are splitting the presentation between us.  Justice for the Forgotten, JFF, merged with the Pat Finucane Centre, PFC, in 2010 and this presentation will cover all aspects of our work north and south of the Border.  Apologies from Margaret Urwin who is on leave.  A brief outline will be provided on the scope and nature of the work of JFF and PFC, how many families benefit from it, the advocacy provided and the key issues for moving ahead.  My name is Bernadette Joly and I was injured in the Talbot Street bombing in May 1974.  After the merging of the PFC and JFF, I was invited, along with Pat Fay, to join the board of the Pat Finucane Centre to represent the interests of bereaved and injured families from the Republic.<\/p> <p>  I will first discuss the failure of the British Government to comply with D&aacute;il motions.  The British Government has continued, over many years, to refuse to disclose the relevant files relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other cross-Border bombings of the 1970s.<\/p><p>They have continued to ignore two all-party resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2008 and 2011 urging the British authorities to make the undisclosed documents available to an independent judicial figure.  Justice for the Forgotten put a proposal to the British ambassador and officials of the Northern Ireland Office in 2013 as to how the issue might be resolved.  We were due to continue discussions with the ambassador but a meeting arranged for November 2013 was cancelled at very short notice by the British side and no further meeting was offered despite efforts on our part.<\/p><p> On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings last year, the President, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste reiterated the call to the British Government to make the files available.  However, the British Embassy's response was absolute silence.  The most recent information we received via the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, several months ago was to the effect that the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, was considering how to resolve the issue.  We appeal to members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring pressure to bear on the British Government to comply with the D&aacute;il resolutions.<\/p><p> I also wish to place on public record our appreciation to U2, who have focused much-needed attention on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings during their ongoing world tour by displaying photographs of the victims as a backdrop while they perform their song about the tragedy, \"Raised by Wolves\".  The concert programme supports the call for full disclosure of the documents.<\/p><p> I move now to the historical investigations unit, HIU, and its implications for victims in the Republic of Ireland.  Under the Stormont House Agreement, it is proposed that a historical investigations unit, which is to be totally independent of the PSNI, be established.  While we would welcome the establishment of such a unit, Justice for the Forgotten is very concerned that the circumstances of the deaths of those were killed as a result of the conflict outside the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland will be excluded from this process and will not be investigated.<\/p><p> Under the Stormont House Agreement, the HIU will be obliged to accept all outstanding cases from the Police Ombudsman for investigation.  Of the families we represent, these will include a number of cases where the victims were killed in the Republic.  I refer here to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Dundalk bombing, the Castleblayney bombing and two single-incident cases.  In these cases, the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit is limited to investigating the role of the RUC.  How will the HIU deal with these cases where the deaths occurred in another jurisdiction?  Will the HIU fully investigate them or will its examination be confined to actions that occurred in Northern Ireland?  We believe it will be necessary for the Irish Government to establish a specific Garda unit to liaise and co-operate with the HIU in these and other cases by providing information regarding actions that occurred in the Republic and evidence relating to the bomb sites.  Justice for the Forgotten also represents families of victims where either a complaint has not been accepted by the Police Ombudsman or one has not been made due to lack of information.  These cases include the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973, the Belturbet bombing and one single-incident murder.  Like the other cases I mentioned, the perpetrators in all these instances came from Northern Ireland, the weapons, explosives and cars used were procured and transported from Northern Ireland and the perpetrators escaped back to Northern Ireland after each attack.

Through our offices in Armagh and Derry we are responsible for approximately 170 cases throughout the North, throughout all counties and throughout various communities.  The largest number of people who approach us - and they make the decision to approach us - come from within the Nationalist or republican community, but not all.  There are people from within what is called the PUL community, namely, the Protestant, Unionist and loyalist community, who approach us because of truth recovery efforts that they are engaged in.<\/p> <p>  I want to explain what the impact has been during the past two to three years and, fairly briefly, since the suspension of the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, because that has had a profound effect on many families.  Many people who live outside that particular little bubble within which the non-governmental organisations are working are not aware of that fact.  The suspension of the HET was brought about by a very critical report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, HMIC, which, in turn, was sparked by a critical report compiled by the University of Ulster.  Quite literally, on the day of the suspension we were with HET officers who were meeting families for the very first time.  Those families were lodging their complaints about the death of their loved ones on the very day of the suspension.  For the first time in 30 or 40 years, they were meeting officers from some type of police investigation unit in order to try to obtain some answers and then the news came through that the unit had been suspended.<\/p> <p>  For many other families, we had a situation where HET reports that were quite problematic were issued.  Our job was to go through those reports and point out the difficulties with them.  There were many other families that were still in the queue and in respect of which the HET process had not even kicked in.  There were at least 100 plus families affected by the fact that the reports into their loved ones' deaths were left unfinished as a result of problems that had arisen or because investigations into their cases had not even begun.  We have a large number of cases - the Glenanne series of cases, of which I am sure the members are aware - which are linked to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and so on and in respect of which we have been working for many years.  Even in those cases, in respect of which some very good reports have been compiled, many questions remain unanswered.  There is an overarching report which we were promised by the HET but which was never completed and which is currently the subject of litigation in the courts in Belfast.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective as a non-governmental organisation, since July 2013 a very large number of families have been left waiting to see if a new body will be set up.  It is very important to consider this matter from a human perspective, particularly in the context of what is happening at Stormont now and what has occurred since the suspension of the HET two years ago.  These are families that have never met police officers.  Following the death of their loved ones, they never met police officers.  They were informed by family members, priests or others of the death of their loved ones.  They have never had engagement with a police investigation.  It is vitally important that some type of independent and robust investigative mechanism be established.  There has been no such mechanism in place in recent years, with the exception of the Office of the Police Ombudsman.  It is important to note that the Police Ombudsman can only investigate allegations relating to the RUC and not to actual murders.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 30 of the Glenanne cases are currently with the Police Ombudsman.  The examination of them is due to start in November.  They include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Castleblayney bombing and other cases relating to the Republic.  Again, issues and problems have arisen in respect of these cases.  Although the examination of them has yet to begin, we would be anxious that the joint committee clarify the position in respect of Garda co-operation.  I am aware of the testimony given earlier by the Fullerton family.  We work with the Fullerton family and I have attended meetings at which officials from the Police Ombudsman have given evidence to the effect that they simply have received no co-operation.  This issue needs to be resolved and perhaps that might happen in the context of the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the mechanisms that have been proposed, draft legislation relating to the establishment of the historical investigations unit was published yesterday.  By and large, we would welcome much of what has been put forward - we believe the families would also welcome it - in terms of some type of investigative unit that is robust and independent.  However, there are issues which arise and the devil is in the detail.  I suspect Mr. Brian Gormally will touch on that, on some of the issues around national security and on the matters relating to who would do the investigating.  It is of absolute importance that an investigative unit such as the HIU be realised as soon as possible.  Leaving aside the legal issues, while such a unit is not in place, Britain remains in violation of its obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention.<\/p><p>We are broadly supportive of the HIU.  We think that the proposals are a good idea but it should happen sooner rather than later because there is a generation dying off.  More than 50% of such deaths in the North occurred before 1976, which is almost 40 years ago, and we see, in Justice for the Forgotten and in other families that we work with, that the relatives are dying.  The clock is against us. <\/p><p> There is also a proposal for the independent commission on information retrieval and for the implementation and retrieval group.  Someone thought of a lot of acronyms when involved in their negotiations.  It is our view that there has been a considerable amount of mischievous reporting on these different mechanisms.  From our point of view, it is absolutely clear, there is no amnesty mechanism built into the Stormont House Agreement and it is important to nail that because that is a myth that has been put out there recently.  There is no amnesty mechanism; there is a limited immunity mechanism.  Limited immunity is the same mechanism as was provided to the Parachute soldiers who gave evidence in the Guildhall in Derry.  They could not be prosecuted on the evidence provided in that hall; they could be prosecuted on the basis of a police investigation, which is now ongoing.  The same applied to the Commission on the Disappeared; there was limited immunity.  We think it was a good idea.  We feel that the commission has succeeded in the sense of victims' remains and providing some closure for those families.  We think that those are strengths and issues that should be pursued.<\/p><p> There are a number of other issues I want to touch on briefly.  One is the issue of inquests.  Many here will be aware of the case of Sean Brown, the GAA official kidnapped and murdered in Bellaghy in County Derry in 1997.  In that case, I have been accompanying the family to preliminary inquest hearings for nine years.  We have been at approximately 28 hearings of preliminary inquest.  There has been a shameful delay over the past nine years.  By and large, the reason for the delay is that the PSNI has failed to go through its discovery process and provide details to the coroner despite constant complaints from the most senior coroner in the North that the PSNI has not done what it is supposed to do.  We have been in that room  28 times with the family, waiting for information to finally be provided to the inquest.  What is happening is an absolute disgrace.  I note that the Kingsmill families and many others are now in the same queue and are being held up in the same way.  That is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p><p> I will give a brief update on the case of Pat Finucane because, as a representative of the Pat Finucane Centre, it would be remiss of me not to do so.  There has been a recent court challenge taken by the family.  It did not succeed in all of the challenge it took within the judicial review but the judge found that the UK Government had not fully complied with its European Convention obligations to the Finucane family.  The family are now considering its options.  The inquiry that was promised as part of an agreement between the Irish and British Governments has not happened.  The Irish Government kept its part of the bargain but the British Government did not.  Following that legal case, the British Government attempted to impose the legal costs for those legal proceedings on the Finucane family but the judge kicked that out of court recently.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#OO00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to give evidence here today.  It is much appreciated as is the work of this committee.  I have provided an opening statement to the committee but I will not read it all out to save time.  I will pick out some crucial points from our point of view.  For those who do not know, the Committee on the Administration of Justice was established in 1981 and is an independent non-governmental organisation working for human rights and we are affiliated to the International Federation of Human Rights.  We take no position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and we are firmly opposed to the use of violence for political ends.  Our membership is drawn from across the community.<br\/><br\/>Today we are talking about dealing with the past.  To date, there has been no overarching legacy commission or transitional justice mechanism to deal with the legacy of the conflict in this country.  Instead a number of criminal justice system mechanisms have examined unresolved conflict-related deaths.  Mr. O'Connor alluded to the fact that serious limitations become apparent in most of these mechanisms, which means that they have been unable to provide accountability for human rights violation and unable to meet the obligation of the UK Government to properly investigate deaths.  Elements of the package have been shown not to have the necessary independence, effectiveness or impartiality to investigate state actors, in particular.  Even those mechanisms which have been independent, such as the ombudsman and inquest, have faced limitations on their powers, delay or obstruction in undertaking their work<i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i><\/i>After the failure to agree on the Haass-O'Sullivan proposals and the earlier Eames-Bradley proposals, which were immediately rubbished by the government, we now come to the Stormont House Agreement.  The first thing to be said about that is that it is an agreement.  Irrespective of the other bits of the agreement, the dealing with the past elements, even though they are in very broad brush terms, were agreed by the two Governments and the five major political parties.  In that context, we believe that the Stormont House Agreement proposals provide the best chance to deal with the past since the Good Friday Agreement. <br\/><br\/>In our view, the proposed institutions have the potential to provide effective redress, yet the efficacy of these mechanisms will lie in the detail of how they operate.  It is this that will determine whether the bunch of proposals of mechanisms will succeed in conducting human rights compliant investigations and in achieving accountability and a measure of truth and justice for victims.<br\/><br\/>This is why CAJ has co-operated with academics from Queen's University and Ulster University and individual experts to produce a model Bill and explanatory notes that would implement the Stormont House Agreement a human rights compliant manner.  As human rights activists, we felt, and feel, the responsibility to put forward constructive solutions and not just sit on the sidelines criticising.  These documents were launched last week in Belfast after a process of continuing consultation with civil society, the UK Government officials drafting the legislation and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The model Bill also contains a suggested draft of the Irish-British treaty which will be necessary to establish the independent commission on information retrieval.  I have sent copies of these electronically to the committee and there is also a briefing document that we have produced on the key issues that we think need to be considered in the legislative implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.<br\/><br\/>I will just pick out some of the main points here.  Yesterday, we received a synopsis from the Northern Ireland Office of what the legislation will contain.  It is only a few pages long and is by no means draft legislation but, unfortunately, it in some ways bears out some of our worries about the implementation.<br\/><br\/>The historical investigations unit is the key institution proposed by the Stormont House Agreement.  It should provide a robust investigative mechanism that could result in criminal prosecutions and should mostly meet the UK Government's obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to properly investigate deaths that occurred during the conflict.<\/p><p>However, there are a number of vital issues - red line issues - which must be dealt with if the institution is to be effective and in line with human rights law and standards.  It must have full, unfettered and unfiltered access to all relevant archives and records, whichever agency holds them.  The UK Government has committed to full disclosure to the historical investigations unit but we are concerned that elements of the discredited legacy support unit of the PSNI may still be involved with the intelligence archive in some way or, worse, transferred lock, stock and barrel into the HIU.  I say the discredited legacy and support unit because the problems with disclosure are holding up the inquest system, for example.  The fact the unit is headed by an ex-RUC special branch officer, a post specifically created for him, destroys the potential independence of that unit.<\/p><p> The HIU investigators would also need to have full access to materials held by other police forces, the security service and the Ministry of Defence, wherever they are located.  In the document published yesterday by the Northern Ireland Office, we are pleased to see that there will be an obligation on UK state agencies to provide any documents requested.  Rather than just relying on the police powers of the HIU, there is a positive obligation.<\/p><p> Where there is no prosecution in a case, the HIU will provide information to families.  Clearly that information will have to be redacted to avoid any concrete threat to the life of any person.  However, we are concerned that the UK Government would seek a veto on the grounds of the undefined concept of national security, which would be an unacceptable restriction on the right to truth.  The publication yesterday by the NIO of the synopsis of the proposed legislation confirms this.  We had written to the Secretary of State about this and yesterday I received a letter from the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office confirming that they will impose such a national security veto, and this of concern to us.<\/p><p> In order to be Article 2 compliant, the HIU must be independent.  This is the absolutely crucial aspect. That means there must not be any connection between those investigating and those who might be investigated.  In our view this means no former RUC, British army or paramilitary personnel should be involved with the organisation in any way.  The NIO synopsis explicitly rejects this proposal for inclusion in the legislation, but it does say that the HIU must take account of the practice of other agencies in ensuring independence.  In that case, we feel it should follow the policy of the Police Ombudsman which excludes former security force members from relevant investigations.<\/p><p> The governance of the HIU must be independent. The Stormont House Agreement says the HIU should report to the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which is, in our view, a relatively independent body but we remain concerned that there may be scope for government control through the manipulation of budgets and departmental interference.  The synopsis by the NIO also makes clear that the HIU will not be accountable to the policing board when it comes to national security matters but will be accountable to the Secretary of State.  While that is also the arrangement for the PSNI, it is a diminution of democratic accountability none the less.<\/p><p> I will not make any comments on the other institutions except to echo what Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Connor has said about mischievous reporting of the independent commission on information retrieval in that it would offer amnesties.  That is completely untrue.  It is simply qualified privileged for the statements made.  It is not immunity for the individual who might make incriminating statements.<\/p><p> The oral history archive is important but is of less immediate significance in human rights terms.  However, it may be very important as a mechanism to allow people to tell their stories about the conflict.  The Implementation and Reconciliation Group, which has a kind of supervisory function and proposes themes for independent academics to draw into narratives of the conflict, will not be included in the legislation that is going through Westminster.  We believe this means it will not be taken seriously.  However, it should be included in the legislation.  The possibility of getting legislation about that through Stormont is probably remote.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor referred to our concerns for the inquest system.  We are highly critical of the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice for his refusal of a request from the policing board for Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to look at the disclosure mechanisms of the PSNI.  We feel this was a disgraceful decision.<\/p><p> On the matter of the way forward, it is now clear that the UK legislation will be laid before Parliament in October.  It will require a legislative consent motion to be passed at Stormont.  We are convinced that this process offers a major opportunity to deal effectively with the legacy of the past.  However, the establishment of a mechanism that fails the human rights test will also fail the test of confidence of the victims and broader society. That would be worse than useless. We are committed to campaigning for a human rights compliant process, and if it is human rights compliant, to campaign for a positive legislative consent motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  We are prepared to campaign against one which does not meet human rights standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#PP00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gormally.

If I was to try to work out a common theme, I think it would be the need for justice and for people&rsquo;s voices to be heard and listened to attentively.  It is all about a process to deal with our collective past in a way that does not dominate the present and prevent people living in the present.  The common denominator among all the witnesses here is that people&rsquo;s&rsquo; voices would be heard, that questions would be answered and that there would be investigations.  It has come across in the discussions that there are conflicting requests from people.  Some want to see prosecutions and sentencing while others are content with answers and the investigation.  How are conflicting demands or requests from people worked through?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the security forces, which is another conflict situation.  There are members of the security forces who gave their lives in the protection of their communities and we also heard of those in the security forces who were involved in collusion.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Justice for the Forgotten meeting the British ambassador, and perhaps the British Embassy might be aware of this committee&rsquo;s discussions today, was a reason given for the cancellation of the meeting and was there any follow-up?  Is Justice for the Forgotten anxious for another meeting with the British ambassador? This should be on the record today.<\/p> <p>  Another common thread from today&rsquo;s evidence is the delays.  There are times when the Irish Government has been forward and progressive and the Northern Ireland or the UK Government have not.  There have also been times when our Government has fallen behind on this.<\/p> <p>  The safety of solicitors who work on these cases is also an issue for concern.  Perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Connor would elaborate on this.  For those of us who have visited the North, in particular the prisons, there is no doubt that there is very little faith in the legal system in the North.  Prisoners remain on remand for lengthy periods.<\/p><p>We see revocation of licences based on closed information so that prisoners cannot defend themselves.  I see us storing up cases for the future.  There will be more and more cases which may have to go to Europe.  On the notion of national security being an issue, I note that on some issues, we were bounced from the Secretary of State to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It appeared to me a very easy cop out to say: \"The ball is not in my court, it is in yours\", which was then repeated.

The Committee on the Administration of Justice representative gave us a briefing on the outline of the legislation, which does not augur well for the process that will develop.  At this stage, the legislation does not appear to be right and there will be an uphill struggle to get legislation that reflects what is needed in the future.

On one level, it is easier for us.  In many ways, we are looking to disagree but in a much better and more understanding and empathetic way.  In the work we do, we do not have to find agreement between those who would like a day in court and to see someone go to prison and those who want something else.  What we hope to achieve is that people have a greater understanding of what people have been through and the issues pertaining to that and to allow perceptions and misperceptions to be addressed.  We are engaged in one piece of work in which there are very real concerns among the group we are working with that - the word \"collusion\" is not being used - a state was involved in and to blame for the way they have suffered.  They have some very legitimate questions they deserve answers to.  However, at the same time they have some misunderstandings.  The chance to engage with a politician or someone else who has been involved in legislation and the process allows them to see that they have not appreciated something.  One can strip away some of the misunderstandings to be left with the core issue.  We are fortunate that we do not have to have agreement.  Personally, I would not in Glencree want to turn to any victim's family or group and say: \"You should not be looking for X, Y or Z\".  We are very careful about not having strong views.

A lot of work is residential which provides time.  One has perhaps a day and a half or two days where a group of 15 to 25 people, many of whom have very different views about the past, present and future, share meals together and have some drinks, sit in a room and have a dialogue.  If it is facilitated well, relationships and understanding can, slowly, be built.  Why we are a big advocate of taking time because having 20 minutes for a question and answer session at a conference does not allow one to even start or get to the humanity of a person.  Someone has to give a statement and someone gives a brief answer and there is no chance of a follow-up discussion.  In a residential approach, one gets a chance to do all of that.  Often, what is said over coffee is just as important as what happens in the facilitated session.  We argue that is vital for peace building and working with legacy issues.  Legacy issues are a key strategic priority for us.  We do not claim we can bring justice for people, but that dialogue approach is helpful and people find it so.<\/p> <p>  I do not think Deputy Pringle was really addressing his remarks to me.  I was asking myself similar questions about there being a HIU in the South.  Personally, I do not know the answer to that, but I was interested to hear the answers given.  It was interesting that Austin Stack seemed unenthusiastic.  However, if the Republic can in any way be proactive around legacy issues, I would absolutely encourage it as vital.  I am afraid that we have in the South have been guilty of slightly washing our hands.  There are exceptions, but we have done that.  There are better people than me to comment on whether a HIU would address their particular needs, but proactiveness from the South would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I would say to Deputy Tuffy - I should have said this at the start - that my comments are based very much on what people tell us in our work.  As such, what I was saying was not based on research.  There are elements of research touching on a number of these issues, but I deliberately separated, although they are linked, mental health issues, dependency on prescription drugs, alcoholism and suicide from continuing violence.  I know from the groups that work with us on a range of programmes that these issues come up.  Domestic violence has come up a lot recently and if people feel brave enough to be able to talk about that in the safe space, they definitely link it, not solely, but in some ways to the Troubles, violence and the structures that were set up within communities.  Whether that is factually correct is sort of irrelevant because if that is people's understanding of why this is happening and it is a growing problem, we have to deal with it.<\/p><p>On the issue of violence remaining, this is not based on research but on what we hear in our work.

There is no doubt that the current phenomenon whereby people are being kept on remand for long periods is deeply concerning and a serious grievance.  I would not go so far as to say the legal system has not changed.  I am not one of those people who think the North has not changed.  It has changed profoundly.  Everything has changed.

There will be an uphill battle regarding the security services and other issues, and we see it in Pat Finucane&rsquo;s case.<\/p> <p>  On the question whether we need a HIU in the Republic, I would not give what we need a name.  However, clearly there is a problem in that the original Stormont House Agreement spoke of all deaths that resulted from the conflict in the North being investigated, but this wording was recently changed to &ldquo;all deaths that occurred in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  Justice for the Forgotten, JFF, contacted the people in Warrington to alert them to the fact that there is a problem.  Last week, I spoke to a woman at the conference whose brother was a British soldier and was killed in the M62 motorway bomb in 1974 in Britain.  All those people outside the North are left out of the process, which should not be the case.  While I do not want to specify the type of unit needed, we talked to the Department of Justice and Equality about it, and it is not good enough to hope that the HIU might, by leafing through papers on a particular case, come across intelligence about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  There must be reciprocal arrangements so that people are specifically searching for information; otherwise, it will not be found.  We need something clearly set up in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  The merger of PFC and JFF happened organically because we both found ourselves, at different times, searching the archives in London and finding the same research, particularly regarding the Glenanne gang, which was responsible for the murder of family members of people who are in this room and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as Judge Barron found.  We were doing the same work and we co-operated on it, which led, eventually, to a merger.  It was easier from the point of view of finance, funding and governance to have one board, which is the board of the PFC, and people from Justice for the Forgotten came on board.  It was a very fruitful thing to do and, while it is not for us to say what other groups should do, it made sense for us.<\/p> <p>  Across the broad spectrum of families with whom we work, there are all kinds of needs.  Some families need investigative processes, which they have never had.  They have a right to those processes.  This need would be satisfied by a robust, independent HIU.  Others we engage with are already at the latter part of the process, with a storytelling exercise called the Recovery of Living Memory Archive, to capture the memory of who the victim was from a positive point of view.  We merge it with the official report and will lodge it in the National Library here in Dublin and in the North.  It is a unique project to merge the official account of a death agreed by a family with the family&rsquo;s view of who the person was, such as details about how the person liked to go fishing or to sing.  This addresses a different type of need for families.<\/p> <p>  One can never legislate for the different needs.  With one family, we are addressing an issue of how to change paternity on a birth certificate.  A lady went to register the birth of her daughter, whose father, to whom the mother had not been married, had been murdered shortly before the birth.  The registrar would not allow her to put the father&rsquo;s name on the certificate, and we are trying to find out how this can be changed.  There are all kinds of different needs in families, and the different mechanisms proposed &ndash; the oral history archive, the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG, and the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR &ndash; cater to a wide panoply of needs.  Some people want justice, correctly so, and a court process.  We are dealing with the only family engaged in an ongoing legal process in which a former British soldier is in court, so I will not speak any further on it.  It ranges from that to other families who do not believe they will ever see that, or do not need or want to end up there because they are in a very different place.  One cannot legislate.  Whatever a family requests, we try to see how their needs can be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#SS00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan raised the issue of conflicting demands.  This is well recognised and has been addressed in the Eames-Bradley report, Haas proposals and Stormont House proposals, in that one could argue that there is something for everybody.  There is an investigative and, potentially, prosecutorial system.  There is the information retrieval commission, the oral history archive and the IRG dealing with narrative themes from the conflict.  Even the HIU goes as far as it can in the direction of prosecution.  After that, if it is not possible, we will give a report to the families, and it seems to be a good method.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan also noted the delay in the justice system in the North and she is correct.  While it is not like it was during the conflict, there is still an unacceptable delay in remands, particularly regarding non-mainstream republican elements who are accused of terrorist offences.  Delay is endemic in the terms of the disclosure in inquests.  There are all kinds of issues of people being off sick or needing training.  We have done a comprehensive, exhaustive analysis of the existing measures, and at the end we went back to the beginning and called that compilation the \"apparatus of impunity\", which is what it amounts to.  The report, like others, is available on our website.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle said what had come out so far did not augur very well for the Stormont House Agreement.  Mr. O'Connor is correct that we have already won some things - for example, I mentioned the obligation on State agencies to provide documents and archives to the HIU.  It is not perfect, given that presumably the HIU will have to ask for documents, and one does not know what is there if one does not know what is there.<\/p><p>There will be an issue, particularly with the secret security service, MI5, and its activities.  The national security veto to which I referred to is a very negative development but it is onward disclosure from the historical investigations unit, HIU.  It does not come between government records and the HIU investigators.  At least, it should not.  While it is negative, it does not necessarily compromise the effectiveness of an investigation.<\/p><p> There are many other issues.  As I said, we want to be able to support this because we think it is the best chance in a generation.  If it is not human rights compliant, it will be worse than useless.  If that is the way legislation turns out, we will oppose it.<\/p><p> What could be done here?  It is pressing on some of those really crucial issues, in particular the question of independence.  We would like the independence of the HIU to be guaranteed on the face of the legislation.  It does not look like this will happen, however.  In a sense, we will have to reserve judgment on that to actually see how it operates in practice.  As I said last week at our conference, it is a question of eternal vigilance when it comes to the implementation and practice of these institutions.<\/p><p> On the question of a HIU in the South, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Connor is quite right.  A consultative document published earlier on this year stated the deaths that were to be investigated were restricted to those occurring within Northern Ireland.  We only got the actual updated material yesterday.  In my quick flick through it then, I did not notice any mention of a unit for the South.  There were some issues about not being able to give the HIU extra-territorial jurisdiction.  That is, of course, true but it does not stop one opening an investigation and asking for co-operation from the place where the deaths actually occurred - for example, if the planning and the people were all from the North but the deaths occurred in the South.<\/p><p> As for the question as to whether there should be a HIU in the South in terms of co-operation with the Northern HIU, as far as I understand it there is a suggestion that the existing security co-operation arrangements will be adequate for security co-operation between the HIU and a special unit that is to be set up in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Whether the latter is called the HIU is another matter.  It is not an official proposal but what has been discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#SS00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>Will that be on a cross-Border basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#TT00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>It will be more a unit in the Garda to co-operate with and give information to the HIU in the North and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

Would the delegations prefer to see prosecutions, if they were still possible, of anyone from the Glenanne gang involved in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings?

It is all very well for cross-party calls for the British Government to release documentation.  I do not see that happening, however.

What do we as legislators in the Republic do in starting investigations into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the incidents in Belturbet, Dundalk, Castleblayney, as well as the other cases to which I referred earlier?

The response of the British Government to date has been abysmal and I know that successive taoisigh and foreign affairs Ministers, as well as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, have met the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Labour Party spokespersons on Northern Ireland.  It is one of the issues we continually raise with them.  We have also raised with the British ambassador the need to respond to the request for meetings with the Justice for the Forgotten group.  The response has been most disappointing and I sincerely hope there will be a different attitude from the British Government and its agencies to disclosures to the historical investigations unit.<br\/><br\/>Am I correct in thinking the personnel attached to the historical enquiries team are former police officers from England, not former RUC or PSNI officers?  I have read Anne Cadwallader's book, <i>Lethal Allies<\/i>, which is based on the work of the Justice for the Forgotten group.  A lot of the facts outlined in the book are based on the work of the historical enquiries team and it is a shame its work was not continued.  We know of terrible atrocities and that 120 lives were lost because of collusion between British and Northern Ireland state forces and murderous gangs in Northern Ireland over a few short years.  It is absolutely essential that the historical investigations unit be independent and that the personnel who carry out the work be at a remove from the situation in Northern Ireland in the past.

I do not ask this to be a smart aleck, but why is there a reluctance to support victims of the conflict in the State?  We support groups in the North but not in the South.  I do not know why but perhaps the delegates might fill us in.  We seem to have a partitionist approach, with huge sympathy for groups and individuals in the North, but when something happens here, the State does not respond.  We heard other speakers talk eloquently about how they had felt left behind or were the subject of incompetent investigations.  Justice for the Forgotten had the same problem or difficulty with funding before it merged with the Pat Finucane Centre.  Why?<\/p> <p>  People said certain things were not part of an amnesty, but, of all the participants in the negotiations, who is actually looking for an amnesty?  As far as I am aware, the only one looking for an amnesty is the British Government, for its own troops who have never served a day in jail on account of their activities.  There was co-operation at the height of the conflict between the Garda and the RUC and we are in a new era, a new beginning, but we do not seem to have the same structures and mechanisms whereby the PSNI and the Garda can co-operate to resolve these issues.  This also seems to be a contradiction.  <\/p> <p>  My last point concerns how we treat victims.  There was mention of the disappeared and people were asked to continue to come forward with information, but it is strange that, even within that group, people were treated differently by the State in terms of supports.  Seamus Ruddy was killed in France and there was not the same support for his family as for all of the others.  That shocked me when I met the family because I thought everybody was in the same position and received support from the British Government, the Irish Government and political parties but no, the family was cut off from these supports.  I do not know if this issue has been resolved to this day.  The structure has evolved in this way and it is understandable people feel angry and frustrated.  One group stated it did not agree with certain terminology, but what terminology do they want?  What are the phrases we should use?  We are dealing with the past and the present, but it seems there are political phrases people do not like.  Are there phrases on which the victims' groups all agree?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#UU00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan asked me how I had been dealt with in the aftermath of the bombing.

On the question of how the Republic has dealt with the North, or not dealt with it, the South stopped dealing with it in May 1974 because it was sent a very clear message to stop worrying about it.<\/p><p>That is what the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were about.  The warning was to leave the North alone: \"Do not to talk about it, or else it will spill over to your jurisdiction.\"  This was the warning shot and just the beginning of it.  That is my personal view.  I think that was the message intended and I think it worked.<\/p><p> In terms of some of the other issues, it is not an either-or situation with the HIU in terms of prosecution.  The HIU is, first and foremost, a police unit whose job it is to attempt to gather evidence and, if possible, prosecute.  That is its job and that is the mechanism within the Stormont House Agreement in which we are most interested, because most families want to see a proper investigation.  Some investigations were carried out by the HET, which were excellent.  We felt, and have said so publicly, that the senior investigating officers who were responsible for the Glenanne case were people of the highest professionalism, and they delivered and were very good.  They assisted us in the recent court challenge in Belfast.  The retired officer responsible for the Glenanne cases came over and provided an affidavit.  I have also seen HET cases that were absurd, ridiculous and hurtful.  There were particularly serious flaws in terms of British army cases.  The HET was both good and bad; it produced a mixture of things.  There were people in it who were able to do their job - there is no doubt about that - but what is needed is a body that can win back confidence in terms of providing independent investigative processes.  <\/p><p> One point I wish to emphasise is that some people portray dealing with the issue of the North as almost impossible.  It is absolutely not impossible.  It is not rocket science.  What we need are mechanisms that work.  Even when we talk about what is needed in the Republic, if one considers the level of co-operation that would take place today as a matter of course between the PSNI and the Garda, that is simply what is needed when it comes to past investigative processes.  They did go on in the past.  I read declassified documents in our office yesterday, along with Alan, related to the fact that the Garda supplied the details of 2,000 cars within a short period to the Vengeful computer of the British army by mid-1976 to have them checked.  Therefore, the Garda was using the British army's computer even then.  These are declassified documents from the Minister for Defence.  If they were capable of that of co-operation at that time, surely they are capable of it today.  I do not think it is rocket science. <\/p><p> On the issue of an amnesty, I do not believe there is an amnesty in the Stormont House Agreement at the moment.  There is a problem in that only four British soldiers have ever been convicted of murder.  In the D&aacute;il there was a unanimous motion on one of those cases, in which the soldiers were allowed back into the British army, and that has caused profound disquiet in the North.  I saw the same happen recently.<\/p><p> In terms of definitions of victims and who is a proper victim and so on, we had a discussion in the office about this recently.  Clearly, what happened with the disappeared worked.  That process worked and was a valuable process for the families.  It is interested to look at who is a proper victim.  It appears that if a member of the IRA is killed, he or she is only a proper victim in some people's eyes if he or she was killed by the IRA.  There is a widespread acceptance that most of the disappeared were proper victims, as I believe they were, but most of them were members of the IRA.  Because they were killed by other members of the IRA, Unionists accept them as victims, but they do not otherwise.  It is a very curious way of doing things.  <\/p><p> There is also the terminology of innocence.  We always say in the centre that we do not work with people who died but with their families.  Their families are always innocent.  Irrespective of what organisation their sons, daughters or relatives were in, the family is always innocent in the sense that they have a legal and moral right to information.  I have two statistics about the issue of innocent victims that may be interesting.  Lost Lives, the definitive study of victims from the Troubles, indicates that loyalist paramilitaries killed approximately 1,200 people, the vast majority of whom were civilians within the Catholic community, while the IRA and other Republicans killed some 1,800, of whom more than 1,000 were members of the security forces.  So the IRA killed some 600 civilians in bomb attacks and other incidents, while loyalists killed twice as many from a smaller community base.  Yet when we use these terms about civilian deaths, we do not actually recognise that over all the years of the conflict, there were only three years in which the greatest number of civilians killed did not come from the Catholic community.  The majority of people killed each year were Catholic civilians.  It is wrong to differentiate between those who were innocent, guilty, civilians, members of the security forces, members of the IRA and members of loyalist groups; their families are all the same, and they all have a right to information and to justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2015092400002#UU00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly on some of the points raised.

I do not expect that we will have complete disclosure of everything that goes on.  It is interesting to see what has actually been declassified, and particularly the pattern of consent for public records and so on.  Even the documents that have slipped through the built-in process are quite illustrative of some extremely dodgy practices.  All we can do is argue for a stronger legislative base for disclosure.  We cannot guarantee that State agencies will not stand outside the law.  I suppose if one is being cynical one would expect that to a certain extent.  All we can do is push and push.  What we will get in the legislation is probably not as strong as would like to get in terms of an overall mechanism.  Connected to that was the question of what the South can do here.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan talked about disclosure.  I think there is a big role in leading by example.  If the Irish State says it is prepared to open the books, effectively that throws into sharp relief any reluctance on the part of the UK, which, I think, has probably got a lot more to hide, if it does not do the same.<\/p> <p>  Again, what could we do here?  Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned the necessary independence of the personnel involved in the HIU and included the HET in that connection.  One of the issues that has been raised by Government sources in discussions around this whole issue is the difficulty they reckon they will have in recruiting sufficient investigators.  They point to the fact that the Police Ombudsman has had a bit of difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of people.  That is partly because budget cuts and so on mean they will only offer short term contracts to people who are relocating from places such as England, and that makes it difficult.  If one pays enough money one will get the investigators.  The HIU, in principle, would be open to secondments, including from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It seems to me that people could be encouraged to apply and for that to be made a fairly easy process.  I have no idea how many would get the positions or what the fallout of that would be.  In principle, garda&iacute; could apply to become investigators, but on the basis of secondment so that they would not have to leave their existing careers behind.  That is an issue that might be looked at.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Sean Crowe asked about terminology.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that terminology is perhaps one of the most contested things in terms of looking at the conflict.  Personally, I do not like the term \"dealing with the past,\" even though in a certain sense it is accurate because, from our point of view, what we say is that we are dealing with current human rights violations by the British state in not fulfilling its obligations under Article 2 to carry out proper investigations.

While I recognise that this will be an uphill struggle, no one imagined we would be in a position where the British Prime Minister would describe Bloody Sunday as unjustified and unjustifiable and that he would stand up in Parliament and state that agents of the state had colluded in the murder of Pat Finucane.  However, he did so and he also met Geraldine Finucane in 10 Downing Street where he accepted there had been collusion in her husband's murder, before contradictorily stating he could not allow an inquiry into the murder because there were too many people in nearby buildings who would not allow it.<\/p> <p>  In many ways, I believe we have won many of the battles.

Another question of terminology arises with regard to whether one describes non-mainstream republicans as dissidents.  In any case, people who are political opponents of the peace process or who support those who are involved in armed actions against the peace process argue that their people are currently being interned by remand.  While I do not believe this is occurring on the same scale or for the same length of time as it did during the conflict, we have had complaints around the issue.  While not every complaint is justified and not every cause is sufficient to argue that these are massive breaches of human rights, none the less it is concerning that people are being held for long periods on remand, during which it emerges consistently at hearings that the police have not prepared evidence and so on.

Truth recovery has often resulted from prosecution and traditional justice, in other words, where a person has served a term of imprisonment.  The implication is that the person has been involved in paramilitary activity because, as we heard, very few, if any, state forces have served time for what occurred in the conflict.  Therefore, there may not necessarily be legal issues.  One may have someone who has suffered as a result of the activity of a person or a group and wants to have more information rather than simply seeing that a person was guilty.  In such cases, one facilitates conversations between the person and the persons involved or another individual acting as a proxy.  This can contribute to healing and reconciliation, although it is by no means for everybody and should be done voluntarily.  It has proved very helpful for some people in their personal journey of healing and reconciliation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raises a very important question and sensible point regarding cases where some people believe the person with whom one is dealing should have been prosecuted or where a case may still be taken.  As the CEO of an organisation that fundamentally believes this process is absolutely vital for humanity and reconciliation when both parties wish to avail of it, I am also aware there are real legal difficulties.  Could one legislate for limited immunity for informal processes as well as formal processes?

It examined how people deal with the past, and one of its findings was that community responses are needed.  These means looking at local communities and identifying their strengths and abilities to deal with issues and the collective trauma they have suffered.  I am not aware of how much further the idea has been taken in terms of identifying what sort of process communities could implement.  The point I was trying to make is that individuals and families have suffered but the suffering has been much more widespread.  There are many people living with trauma who may not have a loved one listed in Lost Lives or who may not feature in a list of injured but are traumatised as a result of what happened in their communities.  A collective response is, therefore, needed.  Some African societies would take a much more community orientated approach to dealing with this issue based on the idea, \"Your trauma is my trauma\".  We are a much more individualistic society and tend to focus, perhaps naturally, on the individual.  I do not claim to know the solution but there are some areas where a community approach would be beneficial.

It was always the case that part of the legislation would have to go through Westminster rather than Stormont.

As I approach the end of my term as Master of the Rotunda, I can look back over the last seven years with a unique perspective.  This has been the busiest seven years in the 270-year history of the Rotunda.  It has been a time when activity levels were extraordinary.  The deficits in infrastructure became very evident and the strain and stress on staff was exacerbated by salary cuts.  The hospital's ability to deal with these issues was curtailed by reductions in funding allocation and restrictions in head count.  The combination of all of these issues has resulted in a significant inability to retain or recruit staff.  These staff are a vital arm of our health service.  All of these issues, and those I am going to identify today, have had a detrimental effect right across all elements of our health service.<\/p> <p>  Over the last two to three years, maternity services in Ireland have consistently been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.  There have been numerous high-profile cases reported in the news; multiple investigations with associated recommendations; high-profile Coroner&rsquo;s inquests; and a variety of HIQA and independent reviews.  It has now reached a point where the confidence of the public has been severely shaken and the quality of the services provided to our mothers and babies is questioned in the media on a daily basis.  Much of the reporting has been sensationalist and some of it out of context.  Such stories are understandably frightening for prospective mothers and families. <\/p> <p>  To put the situation in context, despite all of the negative publicity, we must recognise that maternity and neonatal outcomes in Ireland remain extremely good and benchmark well when compared to services in comparable countries.  Having said that, our results could and should be improving.<\/p> <p>  There is a normal pregnancy loss rate of between four and seven per 1,000 births of babies greater than 500 grams.  Most babies who do not survive suffer from fetal anomalies, extreme prematurity and infection, unpreventable cord accidents or placental dysfunction.  Some deaths are unexplained, even after the most detailed post-mortem examination.  Only a very small number of normally-formed babies in the latter stages of pregnancy do not survive.  It is these preventable situations that we must do our utmost to avoid.  It is in these cases that staffing levels, expertise and experience, funding and infrastructure, as well as good clinical governance are so important.  <\/p> <p>  Obstetrics is demand led.  Demand for antenatal care and delivery is significantly higher now than it was ten years ago.  Some 70,000 babies are born annually in Ireland, which is up from 60,000 a decade ago.  In some hospitals, delivery numbers are up between 25% and 30% over ten years.  I know what that means, as will my colleagues here, but for the layperson they are just numbers.  To put these figures into reality, as a hospital with nine delivery rooms and about 9,000 deliveries annually, we have between 25 and 45 births every day.  That means that each delivery room is used between three and five times a day.  Considering that the average duration of labour for a first-time mother is between eight and ten hours, those numbers just do not add up.  This puts too much strain on our facilities and staff.<\/p> <p>  Ireland had the highest birth rate in Europe between 2004 and 2013, yet we have the third lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the population, among 34 OECD countries.  In order to reach accepted, recognised international norms, we need to increase our consultant numbers by 57% and we need an additional 600 midwives.<\/p> <p>  In 2003, the Hanly report recommended an increase in consultant numbers.  Specifically for obstetrics and gynaecology, a target of 179 consultants was set for 2009, to go up to 191 by 2013.  By the end of 2014 we only had 133, despite deliveries being up by 30%.  In 2006 the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommended 24-hour on-site cover in the bigger units.  A figure of one consultant for every 350 deliveries was recommended.  This would require the current number of consultants to be increased by 57%.  The KPMG report in 2008 recommended an expansion of consultant numbers.  HIQA, in Galway in 2013, said there was a relatively low number of consultant obstetricians in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  That is more than ten years of reports saying exactly the same thing.  I am not sure how many more investigations, reports, and recommendations are required - or how many more adverse events will be required - to get those who oversee and fund the health service to recognise the need to invest in the quality staff required to keep our mothers and babies safe.<\/p><p> The complexity of the patients we deal with has become a serious issue.  Obesity now affects approximately 30% of our patients and, by extension, there is increased risk and cost.  Unusual and resistant infections are now much more frequent and women with complex co-morbidity now conceive, requiring multidisciplinary care across several services.  Population diversity has brought challenges, with new disease entities, greater social and communication issues.  Despite all these challenges, results have remained good but our staff and infrastructure are strained by these extra demands.  Crucially, no additional funding has been put in place to deal with these issues.<\/p><p> With regard to funding, we know that maternal and perinatal mortality rates when Government funding reduces, yet between 2009 and 2012, the busiest time in the history of modern Irish obstetrics, when activity levels were up by 25%, spending was cut by 3.5%.  The recent recession has caused a reduction in fee income for our voluntary hospitals and these fees account for approximately 20% of our budget.  This fall in income has worsened our funding deficit.  We had opportunities to co-locate and, unfortunately, these opportunities were missed.  None of our three major maternity hospitals has immediate access to intensive care facilities for adult patients and sick mothers are still transferred by ambulance to adult hospitals away from their newborn babies.  Access to appropriate imaging, such as CT and MRI, has to be organised off site and access to joint services and multidisciplinary team care requires complex agreements between different hospitals on different sites and sometimes in different groups.  All of these factors combined have resulted in all hospitals having difficulty retaining and recruiting quality staff.  The exodus of our excellent trainees to more attractive packages abroad continues, resulting in an over-reliance on locum and agency staff.  This drives cost up and quality down and is no way to run a health service.<\/p><p> In recent years the HSE set up clinical programmes in most specialties, which have assisted greatly with the provision of national clinical guidelines.  This was a welcome development.  Unfortunately, however, there was no provision of additional resources to allow some of these best practice guidelines to be put into action.  Many hospitals do not have the infrastructure or the staff to implement such guidelines.  Despite the availability of good, solid information on where staffing levels should be, no effort has been made to bring levels of staffing up to recommended ratios.  Better incident reporting has assisted with improved knowledge of clinical incidents but without the factors identified above being addressed, it is difficult to see how we can improve the position.  The new one-size-fits-all incident reporting form currently being trialled in conjunction with the State Claims Agency is not working very well or gathering the sort of vital information that we need to improve our services.<\/p><p> I will speak to inequality of access to services.  Patients in different parts of the country do not have equity of access to subspecialist services and, for example, anatomy screening scans at 20 weeks' gestation are only available in bigger centres.  In the tragic situation where a baby dies, only in the bigger hospitals will a dedicated bereavement team be called in and a dedicated perinatal pathologist be available to carry out a post mortem and get the best information as to what may have been the cause of death.  This is really important information for the family and clinicians.  Mental health issues in pregnancy affect approximately 10% of patients, yet services and staff for these patients are deficient.  Endocrine services for diabetic and thyroid patients are stretched beyond coping point, and this should be addressed.<\/p><p> With respect to governance of services, historically, State-owned HSE hospitals report directly to HSE.  Maternity units in HSE hospitals, therefore, have no direct governance relationship with the HSE, as it goes through the management system, and the performance indicators set for those hospitals by the HSE do not and never did relate to maternity services or their outcomes.  This lack of direct oversight and a reporting relationship which was not designed to identify clinical risks has led to either failure to or delayed response to clinical issues.  This lack of good governance in some hospitals has been pointed out in several recent reports.  Even in voluntary hospitals such as ours, where clinical governance systems are tighter, we have still had great difficulty escalating some of our concerns.  The theme is consistent, as clinicians raise concerns, governance systems are not good enough to ensure these issues are acted upon and nothing changes until something bad happens.<\/p><p> The oversight and running of our health service is currently undergoing another transition.  The country has been divided into regions, with each one serviced by a hospital group based around an academic partner.  The groups have been very slow to evolve.  The appointment of chief executive officers has also been slow and these were meant to have boards to report to but they have not been appointed.  The delay in driving this process carries the risk of leaving a vacuum at a governance level, particularly for the non-voluntary hospitals.  This vacuum creates a dangerous lack of oversight and needs to be addressed urgently.  How the voluntary hospitals fit into this new group model has not yet been worked out.  The Minister has indicated that he sees voluntary hospitals, particularly the maternity hospitals, playing an important role in the new groups, and we welcome his reassurance, although it is unclear how this is going to work.  There is a real fear that in the current proposed model, the voluntary sector, which has contributed so much to the development and improvement of our services, may be threatened by extinction.  This, in our view would be a very retrograde, step for maternity services.<\/p><p> Ireland has a reputation for high levels of medico-legal claims and obstetrics is a high-risk specialty.  Approximately 20% of claims arise from obstetrics and midwifery practice but this accounts for 60% of the monetary value of claims.  This amounts to approximately &euro;60 million annually, enough to run one of the Dublin maternity hospitals for that period.  The State Claims Agency deals with this and shares information with individual hospitals but there is no national learning from this valuable information.<\/p><p> With regard to models of care, all women, regardless of their risk categorisation, should be entitled to the best possible facilities and one-to-one midwifery care, with access to medical information as required.  There has been much discussion around models of care and some very vocal groups are suggesting that midwifery-led models are better.  The delivery of maternity services requires co-ordination of both midwifery and medical obstetric services and it is impossible to separate these two functions because low-risk women can become high risk with little warning; therefore, in most developed countries, care of women in pregnancy is shared between these two professional groups.  The important issue is that all mothers should have access to the best possible facilities in the most relaxed surroundings, with good continuity of care, and be looked after by midwives experienced in both normal and complex labour.  Women who remain low risk can be delivered by those midwives and those who become more complicated can retain their continuity of care with that midwife but responsibility moves seamlessly to the medical team.  There should be no need to move a patient in labour to a different location and continuity should be maintained.<\/p><p> If we genuinely want patient-centred care, we need to get away from the idea that one professional group has ownership over pregnant mothers.  The terms \"midwifery-led care\" and \"medically-led care\" should be abandoned because they put the professional at the centre and not the patient.  All patients, regardless of their risk category, should be able to access the best possible care and medical expertise required for delivery in comfortable surroundings.  Care based on patient need is required.  There is no doubt that antenatal care to low-risk women should be delivered in a community setting, as this would cut out long waits in hospital outpatient clinics and allow hospital services to be devoted to higher-risk patients.  There needs to be significant investment in these community services to promote this model.<\/p><p> The current protection of life in pregnancy legislation is welcome.  It puts some structure and guidance around what to do when a woman's life is at risk.  However, that particular legislation does not assist us when faced with a woman carrying a baby with either a fatal foetal abnormality or one where the anomaly is life-limiting.  Ideally, most obstetricians would like to see legislation that would allow us to support women and their families in whatever decision they make regarding their pregnancy in such a difficult position.  Where a woman chooses to continue the pregnancy, we need to be in a position to support her choice with appropriate facilities and services for her unique situation.<\/p><p> Having identified some of the issues that need to be tackled, I will make some suggestions to the committee and the Minister to assist in improving the quality of services and help restore confidence in our services.  I hope these suggestions will help to inform the work and output of the new national strategy group.  First, we should set up a clinical governance system in each of our maternity units to oversee clinical activity, with appropriate clinical audit, clinical risk reporting and incident review to allow units to benchmark against each other.  This system should mirror what currently exists in the Dublin maternity hospitals, where a clinician leads the service and is accountable for its provision.  Second, each unit delivering maternity services should have a sufficient critical mass of activity to support the full range of services required to deliver that care to the population it serves.  We believe this is approximately 4,000 to 5,000 births annually.  This may require examining the models of care provided in some units or the provision of satellite clinics in some areas.  These decisions can be made on a needs assessment of care.  Third, each unit should have facilities to provide care for a full range services to deal with all levels of complexity, from the normal midwife model to the more complex medical model, with seamless transition between the two again based on patient needs.<\/p><p>I have already mentioned the terms \"midwifery care\" and \"obstetric-led care\" being abandoned and moving to a patient-centred care model.<\/p><p> Low-risk patients should be looked after by midwives based more in the community, where possible, and hospital clinics should be preserved for the more complex patients.  The midwives delivering the community-based care should rotate through the hospital at intervals to maintain their skills, keep up to date with guidelines and stay familiar with current practice.<\/p><p> We need a well-organised and fully resourced national transport system to build on what currently exists to allow transport of mothers and babies to an appropriate setting when required.  Our tertiary referral maternity centres should be co-located with acute adult hospitals which can support the requirements of the high-risk patient.   With access to intensive care and radiology services, stand-alone maternity units should be a thing of the past.<\/p><p> Our maternity units should be staffed to a level commensurate with accepted international standards.  This was recommended in the KPMG report in 2008 and a variety of reports stretching back to 2003 but has never been acted.  Failure to provide appropriate working arrangements for highly-skilled and motivated staff will lead to further worsening of the current manpower crisis.  The staff of the health service are its most valuable asset and need to be treated as such.  Pay and conditions need to be restored to a level where we, as a country, can compete with services in other countries.  We still have one of the lowest midwife and consultant ratios in the developed world.<\/p><p> In moving toward the hospital groups, any governance system we put in place should recognise the value that voluntary hospitals have given in the development of our service and foster the values and ethos of these institutions.  The valuable work led by the national lead in the production of national guidelines needs to be accompanied by resources to allow their implementation.  This issue has not been addressed adequately.<\/p><p> The maternity services need to have access to the State Claims Agency's information relating to adverse incidents and claims.  This hugely valuable information would allow clinical issues and trends to be identifiable, benchmarked and highlighted and appropriate interventions to be made possible.  This information would need to be monitored in an agreed way possibly through the national lead and clinical programmes.  This data will be sensitive.  It, therefore, needs to be anonymised and appropriate confidentiality measures put in place.<\/p><p> Dublin&rsquo;s three maternity hospitals cover almost half the deliveries in the country.  We believe we have a unique perspective and valuable experience to offer.  While we accept that each of our hospitals has from time to time been involved in cases and issues where outcomes could and should have been better, we believe that through good governance and oversight, we have responded to those issues and put systems in place to improve the quality of our outcomes and the service to our patients.  We not only benchmark against each other but also internationally.  We believe our systems are robust and should be replicated across the country.<\/p><p> Above all, our health service is our staff.  They are our most valuable asset and we urgently need to put measures in place to retain them.  Failure to address the already acute staffing issue has started to affect the quality of services we provide and will ultimately lead to a worsening of outcomes, more adverse events and bigger medical, legal and litigation issues.  Doing nothing or token gestures are not sufficient.  We need a strategy to repair the damage that has been done in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>I now call on Dr. Sharon Sheehan to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members most sincerely for inviting me to give evidence on the future of maternity services in Ireland.  I would like to start by introducing myself.  I am the Master and CEO of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, the largest provider of women and infant health care in the State.  Last year, we delivered almost 9,000 babies.  As well as being CEO, I am a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and have trained in both Ireland and the UK.  I am a member of the executive council of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK.  I am also a member of the national maternity strategy steering group, representing the joint standing committee of the Dublin maternity hospitals.<\/p> <p>  In looking at our maternity hospitals, we must remember that, thankfully, the vast majority of pregnancies result in a healthy mother and baby.  We are on the verge of producing the first ever Irish maternity strategy and we must ensure that each child is given the best start in life while endeavouring to make the experience the best possible one for the mother.  Ireland demonstrates one of the highest fertility rates in Europe and despite a recent small decline in the national birth rate, the maternity services are under increasing pressure.  The complexity of mothers attending for antenatal care is ever-increasing.<\/p> <p>  Significant increases in rates of obesity, gestational diabetes, assisted reproduction and coexisting medical problems coupled with advancing maternal age continue to pose enormous challenges for obstetricians, midwives and other allied health professionals.  Poor social circumstances and, more recently, homelessness, are adding to the complexity of patient care.  Advances in neonatal care, particularly at the threshold of viability and the therapeutic cooling of the full-term infant to prevent cerebral palsy, are great success stories but the intensity and acuity of the workload must be recognised and resourced.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, maternity services have rarely been out of the media spotlight.  Much work needs to be done to restore public confidence in our maternity services.  We must acknowledge what is working well and what needs to be improved.  When we look at maternity services, we cannot ignore gynaecology.  Gynaecology is provided in all of the 19 maternity units throughout the country.  Following the very successful introduction of the national cancer control programme, the increase in benign referrals transferred to non-cancer services spiralled out of control in the absence of resources.  Waiting lists for gynaecology outpatients are wholly unacceptable, often exceeding 18 months, but we simply do not have the staff to bring down these numbers.<\/p> <p>  In respect of quality and patient safety, perinatal death rates continue to decline and maternal death rates are among the lowest in the developed world.  Despite the low rates, we cannot become complacent.  A death is a tragedy and we must learn from it and drive improvement and change.  From the most recent confidential enquiry into maternal deaths across Ireland and the UK published in December 2014, we know that the majority of women who died during or after pregnancy died from indirect causes, that is, from an exacerbation of a pre-existing disease.  Three-quarters of the women who died had medical or mental health problems before they became pregnant.  We must plan for the care of women with known medical complications, particularly before they become pregnant, and also during their pregnancy.  Only one third of women died from direct complications of pregnancy such as bleeding.<\/p> <p>  A spotlight has been shone in the past decade on severe maternal morbidity as an important quality indicator of obstetric care and maternal well-being in high-resourced countries.  Learning from morbidities is really important - looking at what went wrong and what went well.  One of our colleagues, Dr. Michael Geary, refers to \"great saves\" rather than \"near misses\" - recognising when patients have received exceptional care and when this care has averted an adverse outcome.  Review and oversight in respect of the provision of high-quality maternity services are really welcome.  Each of the three Dublin maternity hospitals produces annual clinical reports which are not only published but externally assessed and peer reviewed each year.  In addition, each of the 19 maternity units submits data relating to patient safety and quality of care to a number of national agencies for review, including the State Claims Agency, the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre and the quality assurance programme of the HSE clinical care programme in obstetrics and gynaecology.  These allow assessment of performance over time and but even more importantly, they allow us to benchmark our performance against other similar units nationally.<\/p> <p>  In designing models of maternity care for the future, the principles of access, equity, appropriateness, effectiveness and value must be considered.  All women should expect and receive high-quality, safe care delivered in the most appropriate setting by the most appropriate care provider based on the needs of the woman and her baby.  Care must be patient-centred and evidence-based and allow the patient choice.  In Ireland, most maternity care is hospital-based.  Much of this antenatal and postnatal care could and should be delivered in the community.  Community midwifery services in Ireland are patchy and are largely confined to the Dublin maternity hospitals, allowing the woman to access care close to home and, most importantly, permitting continuity of care, usually with a team of midwives.<\/p><p>It is not surprising that demand for these services is increasing.  A nationwide solution must be put in place to resolve this issue.<br\/><br\/>Collaboration and teamwork are essential for the delivery of a safe and high quality maternity service.  Too often we get lost in debates on midwifery-led care versus consultant-led care, high risk versus low risk, consultant-led units versus midwifery-led units, or alongside midwifery-led units, or stand-alone midwifery-led units, and home birth versus hospital birth.  If we revert to the principle of what a woman and her baby or babies need and providing that care, then the pathway becomes much clearer.  Every single woman, irrespective of her risk, deserves midwifery care during pregnancy.  Clinical care pathways facilitate the seamless transition of a woman across health care providers and services based on her needs at a particular time.<br\/><br\/>In looking at models of care it is important to define standards.  At present the standards of care throughout the country are inequitable.  By way of example, international best practice recommends that every mother has a scan early in pregnancy to confirm her dates and again a little later to assess any foetal problems.  These standards are only being delivered in a handful of maternity units throughout the country which is wholly unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>The promotion of normality must also be balanced with the need for escalation in the event of an obstetric emergency.  It is important to define levels of care and determine what level of care should be provided in each hospital.  It is completely inappropriate to suggest that all maternity units should be able to offer high-tech intensive care facilities, but we must guarantee and ensure there is streamlined access to critical care at a time when it is most needed.  The national neonatal transport system is a great example and has been hugely successful.  It aims to provide all neonates who require critical care transport with access to a dedicated, highly professional and equipped team that is available at all times of the day or night.  A similar programme for <i>in utero<\/i>transfers is urgently required.  Both of these transport systems must have dedicated and ring-fenced funding.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the staffing of maternity services, an integrated approach to workforce planning is required.  In addition to midwives and obstetricians, a host of other specialists and specialties interact with the mother or her baby during their time in maternity service care.  They include neonatologists, anaesthetists, general practitioners, perinatal mental health physicians, perinatal pathologists and other allied health care professionals.  Therefore, investment in staff is paramount.  We have a highly skilled and talented workforce in Irish maternity services.  Internationally our doctors, nurses and midwives have always held the reputation of being the best educated and trained, so it is not surprising that other countries look to our highly skilled doctors, midwives and nurses to staff their maternity units.<br\/><br\/>Staffing levels in maternity services in Ireland are a major concern.  The lifting of the moratorium in HSE hospitals has resulted in a significant movement of staff away from voluntary hospitals.  More recently, financially rewarding and attractive packages offered in the Middle East have attracted our highly trained and skilled staff.  Of greatest concern to me are the unfilled places on the bachelor of midwifery university degree programmes and the higher diploma of midwifery programmes.<br\/><br\/>A recent study, entitled Birthrate Plus, reviewed the appropriate staffing levels in Irish maternity units.  I understand that the funding requests for the additional posts deemed necessary to achieve minimum staffing levels have been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Such funding must be approved but we need a robust national recruitment strategy to attract midwives to take up these posts.<br\/><br\/>Our hospitals continue to face ongoing challenges in terms of the European working time directive for non-consultant hospital doctors.  There are insufficient numbers of NCHDs working in maternity services to achieve compliance.  The 20% reduction in training time that would result from a 48-hour week has not been adequately addressed.<br\/><br\/>Last June a supplementary report on consultant workforce planning in 2015 was published by the HSE's national clinical programme for obstetrics and gynaecology.  It showed that Ireland has the lowest number of obstetricians and gynaecologists per 100,000 women and the lowest per 1,000 live births of all OECD countries.  The report states that there is somewhere between 120 and 140 consultant obstetricians delivering services in our maternity units.  It recommends that an additional 100 new consultant posts are required to bring us in line with our UK counterparts.  Promotion and integration of education, training, research and innovation are essential components of high quality clinical care and should be included in all clinical strategic considerations and planning.<br\/><br\/>In terms of governance, all women should have a clearly identifiable lead health care professional.  We need to realise that patient safety is not only a clinical responsibility but is also a corporate responsibility.  Any model of care proposed must be founded on the principles of good corporate and clinical governance and have a strong leadership to drive clinical excellence, quality, safety and clear accountability.  I firmly believe that the mastership model operating in the three Dublin maternity hospitals works extremely well and should be maintained and expanded to the hospital groups.<br\/><br\/>In terms of systems, there is wide acceptance that teamwork and good communication are essential, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that systems can either obstruct or support collaboration.  Therefore, organisational design must support effective collaboration.<br\/><br\/>Kofi Annan has said that knowledge is power and information is liberating.  Therefore, investment in information technology is essential.  Many of the 19 maternity units have no ICT system whatsoever and data must be collected manually.  At present, data are collected through the national perinatal reporting system and the hospital inpatient enquiry scheme, HIPE.  More recently, the Irish maternity indicator system has begun to collect data which highlight the lack of consistency across the different systems.  I welcome the new maternal and newborn clinical management system which has an expected roll-out date of early 2016 to four of the 19 maternity units.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has an international reputation for quality research on maternity services.  Advances in medical research and technologies must be supported.  Maternity care in the future is likely to involve early innovative screening for biomarkers to detect pregnancies that are at risk of potentially life threatening conditions such as pre-eclampsia and other pregnancies most at risk.<br\/><br\/>In terms of funding, our maternity units have suffered from chronic under-investment.  Numerous reports and recommendations for improvements in quality and patient safety have been produced but never funded or implemented.  We cannot allow this cycle to be perpetuated.  Maternity is a demand-led specialty, there are no waiting lists and we cannot cancel clinics or close wards.  In addition, our emergency rooms are neither recognised nor resourced.  There is a lack of transparency about the funding mechanism for our hospitals.  I welcome the new funding models of activity-based funding and money follows the patient.  However, historical under-funding and deficits which have accrued over the years must be addressed if we are to move forward.<br\/><br\/>In terms of location and our facilities, maternity facilities must be fit for purpose with infrastructure that is appropriate for clinical needs.  It is inappropriate to have bereaved mothers sharing a room or a ward with newborn babies.  It is inappropriate to have mothers who are miscarrying sitting alongside mothers with buggies while waiting for hospital appointments.  That is what is happening to some mother as we sit here at this committee.  Funding for the business cases to redevelop our units must be prioritised and made available in advance of any proposed relocations in order that we can deliver a humane service to mothers.<br\/><br\/>To summarise, the national maternity strategy along with all of the other reports must not be allowed to sit on bookshelves gathering dust.  The strategy will only be as good as the plan designed to implement it.<\/p><p>We have a poor track record of implementation of reports and recommendations and I urge the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise, fund and support the full implementation of this strategy.  If I could leave the committee with just one message today, it is that investment in our maternity services, namely, investment in models of care, technologies, equipment, facilities and, most important, our staff, must be prioritised.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to present my views today and look forward to answering any questions the committee might have for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>I thank the two masters for their presentations.  Reference has been made to the fact that in recent years there has been some high-profile and tragic incidents in our maternity services.  There is always the concern, in reacting to such adverse events, that we have a very short-term response and no strategy that flows from it.  We have a knee-jerk reaction rather than putting in place a proper strategy that would deal not just with an adverse event but which would also bring forward better maternity services.  In that context, it was mentioned that we have 19 maternity units in the country serving a population of 4.5 million.  Whatever way it is calculated, 50,000 to 75,000 births will probably be the going rate for the next number of years.  As the population ages, there probably will also be a drop in birth rates.  We should bear all that in mind as well as the fact that when, as I always say, medicine and politics meet, seldom there is a good outcome.  That is often the difficulty in this country.  We consistently politicise our health services.  If a decision is made by a Government or Minister, the medical professionals become political.  We do not seem to have proper discourse or debate about what is right for the patient.<\/p> <p>  When talking to professionals of all hues, colours and backgrounds, I find that sometimes the patients' concerns are very much secondary.  The professionals and politicians sometimes put their own profession and concerns ahead of those of patients.  It is not done in an underhand way; it is often just the nature of the beast.  Between now and the publication of the review of the maternity services, which is urgently required, are we capable of coming up with a blueprint and planning our health services and maternity services in the short and medium term?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Coulter-Smith and others referred to community-led midwifery and maternity services.  To many that means the local maternity hospital is closing down and getting those discussions going in communities can be very difficult.  It was said that approximately 4,000 to 5,000 births per annum is the best ratio to maintain competence, continuing professional development and medical expertise, but many hospitals have fewer than 4,000 births.  There will be many around this table and elsewhere whose maternity hospital in their constituency or region has only 3,000 births, which means closure.  When developing a strategy, we need to come at it purely from the point of view of patients.  I mean that with respect to everyone in this room.  We have made this point in debates on foot of tragic circumstances that have received national and international attention, yet the system trundles on.  We need to follow through on commitments we make.  I am not putting questions but making points because many important people are here today.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about reviews, restructuring and reconfiguration of maternity services, it is normally done as a pretext to a downgrading of services.  We should be honest about that fact.  Over the history of our health services, when we have spoken about reconfiguration and amalgamation, they have often been a result of cuts to capital projects, funding and current expenditure.  However, we not have a huge opportunity to get maternity services right.<\/p> <p>  At the end of that Second Stage speech, Chairman, for which I apologise, I have a couple of questions.  We often compare ourselves to the UK when we look at statistics and best practice in maternity services, and rightly so, but given the geography and size of our dispersed population and the fact we have one large city and pretty much after that small regional towns, apart obviously from the city in Cork as well, for fear I would forget it, where else could we look?  Where else should we look to get a blueprint for the building of good community care, midwifery-led services and high-end centres of excellence attached to tertiary hospitals?  Where else should we look for a blueprint to do all the things we need to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#K00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming our panellists and thank Dr. Coulter-Smith and Dr. Sheehan for their presentations and for circulating the broad text of their contributions earlier.  I have a number of questions although none is directed at any of the witnesses in particular.  As they are comfortable, they might please respond.<\/p><p>On adverse outcomes, the accepted but unacceptable situation is to deny and defend.  Do the witnesses, in their respective positions, believe a change of approach is needed to this disposition, which is very much <i>in situ<\/i>?  Do they believe that not only their profession and the provision of maternity services but the broader public interest would be better served by an acknowledge and apologise approach?  Do they and their colleagues believe they have a role to play in bringing about a change in the approach of the State Claims Agency in this respect?  I think we all recognise that if one were to act individually, as I have urged, the State Claims Agency would go ballistic, as it were.<\/p><p>I will direct a specific question on inquiries and investigations to Dr. Coulter-Smith.  My personal noting of inquiries and investigations is that they are mainly carried out by senior consultants and practitioners engaged by the HSE or hospital management.  These people are the busiest of our practitioners.  They are people such as Dr. Coulter-Smith, who is himself the master of a maternity hospital.  As he is so busy, the consequence of having him on a panel set up to carry out an investigation in another hospital on a particular adverse outcome would be that there would be an inordinate delay in the conduct of the process and the publication of a report and recommendations.  In my constituency of Cavan we have one maternity hospital.  Currently, five maternity related reports are awaited.  It is not the fault of those panellists that in one particular instance we are almost at the three-year mark and still waiting for something to enter the public arena.<\/p><p>I wonder if Dr. Coulter-Smith is engaged in such work.  If he is, how many is he currently involved in and how many over the seven years of his holding the position of master of the Rotunda would he have been directly involved in?  Does he think that is appropriate?  Is that good use of his time?  Would the process be better served by more available clinicians - I do know at what point in their service that could even be viewed as right - or perhaps retirees?  I would be interested genuinely in knowing what his views are in relation to that.  I would add that knowing some of the perils concerned and knowing some of the excellent staff in these maternity settings, including in Cavan, I can affirm the pain and hurt, not only of families but of those who provide such excellent service beyond the line of duty, at the delay in having the facts established.  It is a terrible disservice to excellent doctors, nurses and support staff in the maternity settings.  We need speedy address of these matters.<\/p><p> I note and welcome Dr. Coulter-Smith's remarks regarding the need for legislation that would provide for interventions in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities where such an intervention is the wish of the pregnant woman.<\/p><p> In relation to models of care, Dr. Sharon Sheehan referred to community midwifery services largely confined to the Dublin hospitals.  Is it the case that in the Coombe and the Rotunda that women do not have the choice between consultant-led, medically-led birthing opportunities and midwifery-led ones?  They do not exist in either of the two major hospital.  Indeed, my understanding is that they are only in two maternity settings across the State and both of them are in the RCSI region, close to my domicile.<\/p><p> The Chair might bear with me for one moment.  On staffing levels, I agree with the point Dr. Sheehan made and thank her for so much of what she included in her contribution today.  We talk here in terms of the lifting of the recruitment embargo and we note the failure of the bring-them-home campaign - I do not see a big flood coming home - but Dr. Sheehan stated that the lifting of the moratorium in HSE hospitals has resulted in the movement of staff away.  Could she explain that moratorium reference and the impact of it?  I am a little puzzled.  I enjoyed the point about there being no waiting lists and that clinics cannot be cancelled nor wards closed.  How true that is.  It is a pity it did not apply in all settings across the health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#K00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Coulter-Smith and Dr. Sheehan for what were really very detailed presentations.  As I said as late as last evening in the Chamber, I acknowledge the background not only to the maternity service but to the health service is that we have lost &euro;4 billion in funding, 11,000 staff and 2,000 beds in the past number of years and, on top of that, there has been the moratorium.  Of course, that was on top of a situation where most services were not well staffed anyway and certainly services outside Dublin were much less well-staffed than the Dublin services, and even those were not properly or fully staffed.  Obviously, that is the background and one that I absolutely accept.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The first question is for Dr. Sheehan and relates to the statement, which I fully acknowledge, that much of antenatal and postnatal care should be provided in the community.  I absolutely agree with that.  I would like if Dr. Sheehan would explain to us exactly what that would mean, how that would work in practice and what level of service could be expected and provided in the community.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Dr. Coulter-Smith from where is figure for the cut-off point of 4,000 to 5,000 births annually coming.  I am around quite a while and I have seen that figure vary over the years.  I have never seen it as high as 4,000 to 5,000.  Certainly, in many of the maternity units of our EU partners, it would be considerably lower than that.  I wonder from where that figure came.  Even the lower figure of 4,000 birth were to be implemented, what, in practice, would that mean for the 19 maternity units around the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#L00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their comprehensive presentations.  Many of the issues they raised this morning are ones I have highlighted over the past four years.  In terms of some of the issues, it is like banging one's head against a stone wall.  Dr. Coulter-Smith raised fact the number of consultants is 133.  The Hanly report stated that over 170 consultants should be appointed.  The Hanly report dates from 2003 but very little progress has been made.  Dr. Coulter-Smith gave the figure of 133.  I understand that whole-time equivalent consultants number 114.  Therefore, we have moved from 93 consultants in 2003 to 114 and at the same time, we have had a significant increase in the number of deliveries and very little response from within the system as regards sanctioning additional posts.  Even if one wanted to recruit an extra 20 consultants in the morning, what kind of difficulties would we face in trying to recruit that number of consultants in a short time period and what do we need to do to make it attractive for consultants to come back to Ireland to provide the service required?<\/p> <p>  The second issue follows on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's issue in relation to inquiries.  I also have a concern about that issue where there is a delay in dealing with inquiries.  Is there a need to set up a better structure for dealing with inquiries than what we have at present because each hospital seems to be dealing with them on an individual basis rather than in a co-ordinated way?  Should we have a set system in place for all of the hospitals because I am a little concerned about the delays?  The immediate reaction of those involved is that there is a cover-up going on.  The next step is litigation and then there are considerable complications thereafter.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to raise is about the coverage.  Dr. Coulter-Smith referred to the amount of adverse coverage of the maternity services.  In relation to the effects it has on staff in the maternity units, is there any back-up supports for the staff who have worked to the best of their ability in delivering the services?  The focus is very much on the hospital and its staff when something goes wrong and that obviously has a knock-on effect on staff and on their performance.  Is there enough backup support for staff where something goes wrong?<\/p><p>I recently came across a case where something went wrong.  While it was no one's fault in real terms, the staff member wanted to resign the following morning.  Someone had to sit down with them for three to four hours to try to talk them through it.  It was an issue out of their control.  Do our hospitals have enough support for the staff where an adverse outcome occurs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#L00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1283,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their in-depth statements.

For a long time there has been a lack of joined-up thinking and a lack of funding.  <\/p> <p>  I believe in the idea of the co-location of hospitals and particularly training hospitals.  I ask Dr. Sheehan for her views on the proposed location of the new national children's hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus and the proposed location of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital on that site.  It probably will not happen very soon.  I would be interested to hear her thoughts on that given that I live quite close to it.<\/p> <p>  I am the mother of four girls, three of whom have babies - I have three grandchildren.  During all their pregnancies they got excellent care in the community from their GP and particularly from the local nurses, etc.  The idea of visiting the hospital and then visiting one's community care is very important.  I agree with the witnesses that if we are to help people, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy and particularly young people right across the board, regardless of whether they have medical issues, it is the place to do so.  It is very important to invest heavily in community care.<\/p> <p>  As a mother, I know that going into labour for the first time is a terrifying experience.  In the long run when a pregnant woman goes in behind the hospital doors she is completely in the hands of the staff and dependent on the quality of staff.  It is not always about the medical care, it is about people just being there for her and doing the normal things that nurses do such as holding her hand and bringing her through the stages of her pregnancy.  We do not appreciate the quality of the people in hospitals, not just nurses but other people working in the hospitals even down to the people who give out the tea in the evening.  The camaraderie they show in speaking to people and looking at the babies is very important.  In that respect, I believe our hospitals are unique.<\/p> <p>  My only question was on co-location and the possibility of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital being located on the site.  I thank the witnesses for taking time out of their busy schedules to come here and present to us.  I will go away more enlightened this morning.  I am a member of a Government party and we certainly have not fixed many things in health.  However, I think we are going in the right direction when we have reports such as this and we can understand what people have to deal with in hospitals, particularly the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#M00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  I compliment our maternity services in general.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne has said, the whole system from when a pregnant woman attends her first appointment to the delivery of the baby is excellent.  The care that is given in maternity hospitals by midwives, obstetricians, gynaecologists and others is outstanding.  As outlined in the presentation, half of all babies born are born in Dublin, but I want to praise the services in the west and north west.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that the obstetricians and gynaecologists have the expertise that is needed in the case of rare diseases.  I am speaking for myself because when I was pregnant I got acute fatty liver disease, which is a very rare disease.  I know I am extremely lucky to be here, which is because I was looked after very well by one of our top gynaecologists, Meabh N&iacute; Bhuinneain, who is completely dedicated to her job.  She is always furthering her career and is deeply interested in maternity services.  Her registrar, who had worked in many big hospitals - I think, in New Zealand or Australia - had seen the disease previously.

Adverse outcomes are tragic.  They are of huge concern to us when they happen.  They are obviously major life events for all the people involved.  They are very difficult and very time consuming.  In addition to the grief there is often anger and many issues need to be dealt with.  The key to dealing with adverse outcomes is to keep lines of communications open, to embrace the idea of open disclosure, and to have a bereavement team that is able to come and sweep up the situation and get everything organised so that no issues are left unsorted.  There needs to be open disclosure and an open door policy so that people can communicate and those lines of communication need to be with senior clinicians and senior midwives.  That is why Dr. Sheehan mentioned the idea of a lead person involved in everybody's care.<\/p> <p>  We also need to have perinatal pathology.  Our submissions mentioned that perinatal pathology is not available everywhere.  That is a very important part of the jigsaw for patients.  Timely post-mortem examination with timely results keeping those lines of communication open with patients is a really big part of successfully dealing with an adverse outcome.<\/p> <p>  The coroners' system is slow.  Getting information back from coroners can often take months.  The more time that is left before making contact with patients and getting them back to give them results is time for them to dwell on what has happened.  We need to keep those lines of communication open in the intervening time and we need that process to be as speedy as it can possibly be.<\/p> <p>  I have not personally got involved in external reviews; I am far too busy doing what I do on a daily basis to do that.<\/p><p>Often, such reviews are done by senior clinicians who filled my role previously, that is, ex-masters of the maternity hospitals.  Success in dealing with an adverse outcome lies with communication, bereavement teams, perinatal pathology and open disclosure.  We in the Rotunda have embraced this approach completely.  We are open with patients when things go wrong.  There will always be situations that are difficult to deal with but, in the majority of those, patients are grateful when one is open and honest with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>Is there a particular reason for the delay with the coroner?

It may be pressure of work, it may just be that the system is a little slow.  It would assist us greatly if those types of cases could be turned around more quickly.  We have a good relationship with our coroner.  We are able to lift the telephone and talk.  If we need to give results to patients, he is often amenable to doing so.  This may not be the case across the country.  I do not know.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Kelleher's question, we often have knee-jerk reactions to adverse events.  This is unfortunate, as we need a considered approach.  It revolves around the same issue I raised in my answer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The cornerstone of good governance is open lines of communication and open disclosure, but we also need other elements.  The cornerstone of good obstetric care is the staffing level.  This must be appropriate for our activity levels.  We must also have an appropriate infrastructure.  One cannot put 40 deliveries per day through nine delivery rooms.  It would not work and would be too much strain on staff.  Staffing, facilities and infrastructure have been stretched significantly in recent years.  Funding of the service is also important.  Maternity services have been underfunded compared with the level of activity in the system.  These four elements will be important in the development of our service.<\/p> <p>  As to where should be look for best practice, there are good models across the world, for example, in elements of what Australia and Canada do.  However, one cannot just transplant a system from one health service into another because one is not comparing like with like or starting with a blank canvas.  One should take the good elements and consider what is available.  Plenty evidence of best practice has been published.  We have discussed reports, for example, Hanley in 2003, KPMG in 2008 and the recent report on manpower.  They are all saying exactly the same thing, namely, that we do not have enough midwives and doctors in the systems.  We must rectify that situation.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to Senator Colm Burke's question on how to ensure that we bring more people back to the system.  We must be competitive in the package that we offer.  It is not just about salary, but services, operating theatre lists and the ability to practise what people have learned abroad.  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about the culture of people travelling abroad to train.  I did that, as do the majority of people.  One qualifies as a doctor, decides what one wants to do, does a year or two in Ireland and learns the basics before going away, subspecialising and becoming skilled in a particular area.  Previously, people used to want to return.  Nowadays, that is not the case.  We have well-qualified doctors.  Some of the best in the world come from Ireland.  Unfortunately, they are not returning anymore.  This boils down to the package that we can offer, including facilities, infrastructure, staffing and funding levels and the possibility of performing the sort of world-class research that we are capable of but which we cannot do currently because we are not bringing people back to do it.<\/p> <p>  The answer to all of these questions is that, when bad things happen, be open about them.  There must be open lines of communication, open disclosure, bereavement teams and pathology.  A multidisciplinary package is required to answer questions quickly, openly and honestly.  The same applies in respect of the quality of the service.  It all boils down to facilities, infrastructure, staffing and funding.<\/p> <p>  As to the figure of 4,000 to 5,000 births annually per delivery unit, I am not suggesting that units that deliver 1,500 or 2,000 women should close.  Rather, if one wants a delivery unit that can provide a medical model of care - I do not like talking about medical models - including the full range of anaesthesia, perinatal pathology, 20-week anatomy scans and foetal medicine and newborn babies looked after by neonatalogists, not paediatricians, one needs a critical mass of approximately 4,000 or 5,000 deliveries in order to ensure that those people have enough work to maintain their skills.  One will not get value for money from a smaller unit because, although teams will be on call and available, they will not be doing much with their time.  If a unit with 1,000 deliveries has a full team of obstetric anaesthetists, they will not be doing a great deal for much of the time.  I am not sure whether I have answered the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>I am not sure either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#N00400","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>What I am saying is that it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>What is Dr. Coulter-Smith proposing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#N00600","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443083400,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>It boils down to patient-centred care.

We need to be very careful because there is a fear among larger units as well that they will suddenly not be able to cope with having 12,000 to 13,000 deliveries in their units and the smaller units are obviously fearful of closure.  It is not for me to say whether units should close as that is way beyond my level of expertise.  We need to look at providing a nationwide service of maternity care and how that can best be provided across hospital groups and centres.  The hub and spoke model, to which Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith, referred is very important.<\/p> <p>  As part of the strategy, we have had a number of invited speakers in to speak to the steering group.  We have invited in Paul Fogarty, who is involved in the Northern Ireland maternity services strategy, and Polly Ferguson, who is involved in the Wales strategy.  Wales would have similar demographics to ourselves in terms of the length of time it would take for some patients to travel to a maternity unit.  Many of the women who come to our hospital, the Coombe, live in a catchment area where it would take anywhere between an hour to two hours to get to our hospital.  When we consider Cork and Kerry, it could potentially take four and half hours for a woman to travel to the nearest maternity unit.  Those women must be provided for.  We must be able to offer a safe service to every woman in the country.  As Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said, we need to decide what levels of care can be provided, in which hospitals and at which point is it more appropriate to transfer a particular woman and-or her baby to another unit that can offer a different level of care.  We already do that and that works very well.<\/p> <p>  It is in the context of the community model that we are able to expand our services in terms of antenatal and postnatal care.  If one were to go into any of the Dublin hospitals, one would see that the antenatal clinics are burgeoning with patients who do not need to be there.  That care can, and should, be provided in maternity and community settings.  We offer community midwifery care, as does the Rotunda Hospital and Holles Street hospital.  It is important for us to expand that.  What works very well is where patients only come to the hospital to deliver their baby.  We have many clinics running like that, where the women are seen and have all of their antenatal care in community.  We have a clinic which runs from Naas hospital.  It does not have a maternity service, but we run a full antenatal clinic there.  Patients are booked to that clinic, have a scan done there, have all of their antenatal care there and only attend our hospital to have their baby.  We need to replicate that model across all our communities, where we only bring the patients into hospital who really need to be there.  We need to stop medicalising it where it does not need to happen.  That is response to the question with regard to what happens in other countries.<\/p> <p>  I would echo Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith's point that we need to look at other jurisdictions.  As I said, we have looked at Northern Ireland and Wales.  Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and other countries in Europe also need to be looked at.  I second the point that was made, that we cannot pick up a strategy and system in place in another country and simply prop it down in Ireland and expect it to work; that will not happen.  We look at the UK, as our closest neighbour, but it has a very different health service from ours.  Its funding mechanism for health is entirely different from ours but its community midwifery services are extremely well developed.<\/p> <p>  I return to other points that were raised in that context.  The roles of the general practitioner and the public health nurse are very important.  It is very useful to have general practitioners and representatives on the national steering committee.  I am not sure if everybody knows but obstetrics is not a requirement of the general practitioner training scheme.  One either does obstetrics or one does another model, so not all of our general practitioners are trained in obstetrics.  That is an important aspect.  <\/p> <p>  I would also add that public health nurses who look after mothers when they are discharged and after the babies when they go home are not employed by the hospitals but are HSE employees and midwifery is no longer a requirement to do public health nursing.  It always was in the past.  We always trained staff in midwifery and then they went on to become public health nurses.  They are no longer required to train in midwifery and yet they are expected to look after mothers and babies when they go home to the community.  We need to have an integrated structure and, as I said in my presentation, we need to have a integrated workforce planning strategy in place to match the kind of services that we expect and are able to deliver.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments, although he is no longer here.  He spoke about the deny and defend culture.  I would like to deny that this culture exists in our hospital.  Open Disclosure was launched by the HSE in conjunction with the State Claims Agency but I would argue that open disclosure exists in our hospital.  One of our board members has raised concerns over the title, Open Disclosure, which implies that the disclosure we had heretofore was, in some way, potentially closed.  I would echo those concerns.  We have a very open culture with our patients.  It is important to maintain that, to acknowledge and apologise when an adverse event has occurred and to establish, along with the patients and the staff involved, what went wrong and how we can improve the service.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne and Senator Burke mentioned the effects on staff who are involved in an adverse outcome.  There is emerging evidence of, and talk about, a second victim in an adverse event.  The staff members are now being referred to as a second victim.  An adverse event often has life-changing impacts.  We are all traumatised when something goes wrong.  We are traumatised by the loss for the family and share in the grief experienced by the family when something goes wrong.  There is the trauma of an adverse event and then there is the trauma associated with potentially being in the coroner's court or potentially being in the legal system, which is a long-drawn out process.  There is emerging evidence to suggest that there are suicide rates associated with staff who have been involved in adverse events and that they are increasing.  We have a huge role to play in supporting our staff when these events occur, in addition to supporting our patients.  We have advanced bereavement support in the Dublin hospitals but such support in the other hospitals leaves a lot to be desired because of a lack of resources around that.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of systems in place for our staff, certainly in our own hospital, in terms of employee assist programmes, to look after them when they are involved in such cases but such cases can go on for years.  It may be ten or 15 years before a case appears in court, particularly a case involving a baby who has been born with cerebral palsy.  That has hugely life-changing consequences for the family but also for the staff.  Staff may never again work in medicine after an adverse event and we need to support staff.  I would strongly echo what has been said in that respect.<\/p> <p>  I have addressed the questions Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the models of care.  He also asked about the moratorium and my reference to staff moving.  Many of our staff had been commuting significant distances during the HSE embargo on recruitment.  Following the lifting of the moratorium in the HSE hospitals and as posts opened in hospitals, such as Portlaoise, Kilkenny and in hospitals around the country, our staff who lived in those areas were able to obtain employment and moved back to those hospitals.  We saw an exodus from the Dublin hospitals largely of staff moving to HSE hospitals where they could not heretofore get jobs.<\/p> <p>  The other questions put to me related to community care.  As I mentioned, the main elements are in terms of antenatal and postnatal care.  Who would not want to be cared for in one's community?  Which one of us would not want a midwife to essentially come home with us when we go home with our baby and when we are learning to breast-feed and look after our baby?  Women are given an enormous responsibility, that of being able to look after a baby, for which nobody has prepared them, and what woman would not want the midwife to visit her everyday at home?  We need to develop, resource, staff and fund that service.<\/p> <p>  Senator Burke raised a question regarding the 114 whole-time equivalents.  I would add that they are not even 114 whole-time equivalents dedicated to obstetric care.  In respect of the number to which the Senator was referring, we are all qualified as consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists.  There are not 114 whole-time equivalents in pure obstetrics as the number dedicated to that care is far fewer than that.  Too often when we think of maternity services, we think only of the number of births.  More than 8,000 surgical operations are performed in my hospital every year and those are taken out of and resourced from that complement of obstetricians and gynaecologists.<\/p><p>It is far more than simply the number of births delivering that defines our services.<\/p><p> Reference was made to staff going away.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that she has spoken to staff who are leaving because there are no positions open here.  That is a real concern.  Like Dr. Coulter-Smith I trained abroad and I welcome people going abroad to train.  What is unique, however, is that many of our staff who leave to train abroad have absolutely no intention of coming back to Ireland.  That is new.  We refer to ourselves as having a homing pigeon beacon, something inside our brains that makes us want to come home.  This seems to have been switched off in the staff who are qualifying and training now.  I sat amidst a group of UCD medical students last year who were embarking on their obstetrics and gynaecology programme.  I asked for a show of hands for how many saw themselves with careers in Ireland eventually.  Less than half of the class raised their hands.  That is unique.  In my class in UCD, everyone wanted to come back here.  We all aspired to work in Ireland and put back into the system what the system had given us in our training.  We are now training to export and we need to ask ourselves why that is.  Why are our jobs and hospitals unattractive?  They are not.  We are delivering excellence in outcomes for mothers and babies, but we need to ensure that the resources and funding are put in place to recognise that and develop it.  We must avoid being short-sighted or knee-jerk in our reactions by quickly changing one problem but ignoring what may be a far greater problem in the room.<\/p><p> Senator Henry discussed picking up rare diseases in pregnancy.  Her case epitomised the care needed in maternity care.  As a young healthy woman she developed a potentially life-threatening complication although she would probably have been considered a low risk.  The low-risk mother can become high-risk at any point in her pregnancy and we need to be able to cater for the needs of all our patients.  We need to recognise that simply because a woman is low-risk at the start of her pregnancy does not mean she will stay in that category throughout.  This is why I urge collaboration across midwifery and obstetric care as well as the other medical specialists who we rely on heavily when patients develop complications.  We need to be able to seamlessly transition our patients to the appropriate care when and as they need it.  It should be possible for a woman to book in a hospital that may not have certain expertise but where the training is in place to recognise when she develops a problem.  This should facilitate her being moved to the appropriate centre of excellence to ensure she receives all the care she needs.  I urge us not to get lost in the debates of territorialism of maternity services, the idea that a woman must remain low-risk or high-risk or that she must be in midwifery care or consultant-led care.  Let us forget about that.  Let us move as the needs dictate.  We must remember that we have two patients: the mother and the baby.  A low-risk mother may carry a high-risk baby.  Conversely, a high-risk mother may carry a low-risk baby.  That is the key and that is why obstetrics is referred to as an art.  We need to work seamlessly across health care professionals to deliver what patients need, not what I, as a consultant obstetrician, need or what a midwife needs.  We should let our care be truly patient centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>I want to raise the coroner situation.

Certainly I would not deign to speak on behalf of Dr. Farrell but in many conversations I have had with him on the matter, I have ascertained that there are major delays in obtaining reports.

I am a consultant neonatologist in the Rotunda Hospital and in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  I am also a member of the national clinical advisory group for neonatology.  Recently, I was appointed as clinical director of Temple Street hospital.<\/p> <p>  The Rotunda and Coombe hospitals are in a unique position.  They tend to have the largest volume of these patients.  The document before the committee goes through the matter in more detail but in the interests of time, I will try to summarise it.<\/p> <p>  Neonatal abstinence tends to pertain to those babies who are withdrawing from mothers who are substance abusers, generally of opiates, including heroin and methadone, as well as other hypnotics.  What we have seen in the past five or ten years is that the majority of these mothers are polydrug users.  One of the greatest challenges in delivering a maternity service arises where the mother is on a benzodiazepine, for example, Valium or sleeping tablets.  She may not always declare it.  The half-life of these drugs is far longer than for others, so the baby may not actually withdraw for two to three weeks and by then the baby is home.  The way we manage that and how we identify it are major challenges.<\/p> <p>  There is a policy in the UK and in some centres in the United States to encourage these mothers to abstain during pregnancy.  We have found, through research between the Coombe and the Rotunda undertaken by our chief pharmacist, Brian Cleary, that this is probably not a good model.  What tends to happen is that if we ask the mother to abstain she actually disengages from the services, does not attend her antenatal clinic and gets into far more trouble during the pregnancy.  A good deal of research suggests that keeping these women on a methadone programme is actually safer for mother and baby.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 100 per year come to our services in the Rotunda.  I have given the committee our clinical specialist midwife report.  Some 68 of these delivered in 2014.  Up to 10% of our deliveries, approximately 1,000 babies per year of the 9,000 delivered in the Rotunda, are admitted to the neonatal unit.  Of the 68 deliveries, 33 were admitted for a variety of reasons, not always for neonatal abstinence syndrome.  It may have been because they were born more premature or because they had problems with blood sugar.  Approximately one third, that is, ten or 11 of that figure - sometimes it could be 15 or 20 - would have had full-blown neonatal abstinence syndrome.<\/p> <p>  One difficulty is that it is not necessarily the dose of the drug or the number of drugs the mother is on.  Some babies have a genetic predisposition to withdraw more acutely while others withdraw more chronically.  There are major social issues dealing with these mothers.  They often come from troubled backgrounds.  They do not have very good parental models.  They may have had other children who are already in care.  There are complex social issues.  Having a drug liaison midwife has made a major difference.  I apologise for the typographical error in the document provided in that the word \"lesion\" should be \"liaison\".<\/p> <p>  The infrastructure to which Dr. Coulter-Smith and Dr. Sheehan referred is a problem for us.  Ideally, once these babies are identified under the scoring system as requiring more intensive management, they should be nursed in a dark quiet room with dimmed light and swaddling.<\/p><p>That is not possible in the Rotunda Hospital in 2015 because we do not have the space.  Ideally it should be done in a transitional care unit so that the mum can stay with the baby which stops the social problems escalating.  If we take the babies away from the mums, they are in a busy, high-dependency unit with 20 other babies.  Our nurses are a bit nervous about nursing them in a side room because of the implications for staff safety as well as baby safety.  The infrastructure is not there to provide the model of care properly and, therefore, our length of stays are far too long.  The committee will see that the average length of stay for these babies is between 11 and 54 days.  Although the numbers are small, they block our beds from a practical point of view.  Furthermore, we are not giving the babies the service they deserve because they are not being managed as appropriately as they should be.<\/p><p> The elephant in the room is the very controversial issue of foetal alcohol syndrome.  We probably have a lot more problems with this syndrome than is openly acknowledged in this country.  We have proposed a project to the Health Research Board, HRB, which would study this anonymously, as was done 15 or 20 years ago for HIV.  Babies would not be identified and we want to look at the their first poo at delivery and check the alcohol levels.  That would give us some data because we do not have data on the number of babies exposed to alcohol during pregnancy.  This is an issue that I and Dr. Miletin from the Coombe hospital have spoken about previously.  We might see one or two babies a year who clearly have full-blown foetal alcohol syndrome but the mother would be an identified alcoholic.  There are probably many more babies affected and those effects are probably a lot more subtle.  They may not present with problems until they are two or three or at school-going age when we see learning difficulties.  Unless we know how widespread the problem is, we will not know how to deal with it.<\/p><p> Despite all of the infrastructure and staffing problems to which I have referred, one can see from the report by our drug liaison midwife, Justin Gleeson, that the number of admissions is going down and that how we manage those babies and the number of babies who get to go home with mum, albeit with a grandmother or other support provider in place, has improved dramatically since he was appointed in 2008.  We have a dedicated team in place.  Patients see the same midwifery specialist antenatally, during labour and afterwards.  He is the key link for us with social services, with the obstetrics team headed by Maeve Eogan, one of my obstetric consultant colleagues, and with a really good pharmacy support service.  We do it well but it could be done a lot better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adrienne Foran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1320,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Foran.

I have spoken to these foster parents about caring for such children, many of whom do not present with problems until they are seven or eight years old.

However, if we had a community-based drug liaison midwife and Justin Gleeson had the support of another colleague, we could probably identify the more subtle exposures, particularly to alcohol, earlier and get those patients into the system.  What we are presenting here and what we know about is probably only the tip of the iceberg.  What Deputy Byrne is seeing in the community probably reflects better what is really going on.  The Deputy is absolutely right that these are not easy babies to bring home.  They withdraw for months if not years, they do not sleep very well and get terrible nappy rash.  They are not easy babies to care for.  We rely very heavily on the foster care system.  The committee will see from our report that regarding the 14 babies mentioned, there were 19 interim care orders.  We had one horrific case where a mum was booked in for a C-section for medical reasons.  When she realised that a C-section would mean that would not have access to drugs for five days, she went off the rails.  When she presented the baby was in severe trouble because she did not stick to the programme because she was worried about being kept in hospital for five days.  If we had continuity of care through another colleague for Justin Gleeson who could cover weekends and out-of-hours, we could stop those few who escape.  Such patients are very fragile and they feel very guilty.  We cannot be judgmental because addiction is a complex issue.  The judgmental attitude has gone and that has helped a lot but if we ask these women to abstain throughout their pregnancy, it falls apart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adrienne Foran"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>Can I continue, Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#Q00700","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>Yes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#Q00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1327,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to the breakdown of monthly clinics and client numbers for 2014 in the report.

I could bring the witnesses to my office and show them the mountain of files I have on homeless people, as is the case with Deputies from throughout the country.  The biggest issue with homeless women who are pregnant is the difficulty in tracking them down.  They move around so much that it becomes difficult to keep in contact with them, especially if they change their mobile phone number.<\/p> <p>  Regarding babies who are born with addiction issues, as I said already I did not realise that they were continued on a methadone programme, which information is very helpful.  I have never witnessed such a baby having a seizure but I know someone who has and I know that it was a truly frightening experience.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their very comprehensive report.  This is an issue I have been concerned about for some time because in the area I represent, there are large numbers of young mothers who have substance and alcohol abuse issues.  It is for that reason I wanted to try to get a better handle on the medical end of things and to determine how I can, in my work as a public representative, help to direct people to the appropriate services.  I agree with the witnesses that when mothers leave hospital with their newborn babies we must continue to track not only those with problems but also the healthy babies.  I know it is difficult for service providers to trace and track those who are addicted to alcohol or drugs in their journey with their babies.<\/p><p>I have to pay a huge compliment to the staff I do know who deal locally with people with substance abuse issues.  I also want to pay a compliment to the many foster parents who take on these babies with their not-normal medical issues.

The Government needs to look at that in more depth and at how these foster parents can be helped in order to maintain some kind of normality in their own lives.

The fact we are able to discuss this issue and the services put in place in the Rotunda and the Coombe for this vulnerable group of patients is important.  The reason we could do this, as well as expanding our foetal medicine units and the many subspecialist services, is because we are voluntary hospitals.  We have the ability to make decisions around the type of service we provide, as long as it is within budget.  In recent years we have expanded areas, done things a little bit better, worked on some specialism, employed specialist midwives in particular areas and sent people off to train.

Voluntary hospitals have the ability to expand services and deal with issues as they arise in a timely manner, whereas hospitals under other governance systems find it a little more difficult to do.

What I can safely say is that the vast majority of obstetricians would like to see a situation where we are able to look after and support women in the choices they have made regardless of what those choices are.  If a woman decides that she wants to carry on with her pregnancy and maintain it, we need to be able to support that choice where, because she has unique needs, we can look after her in facilities that are possibly slightly separate from ordinary antenatal clinics which cater for the run of the mill normal obstetric patient.  Resources need to be made available for that type of situation.  Hospice-type care for those babies would be very welcome but we need facilities to do that.  Our current infrastructure does not and could not support that type of facility.  That is a very humane way of dealing with things.  In the same way, for women who choose not to proceed with the pregnancy, ideally, we would like to be in a situation to support them in that choice.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about low-risk and high-risk women becoming pregnant.

Last year, we had reported a current alcohol use rate of 1.4% for all our patients.  The issue is whether we believe that only 1.4% of our pregnant women are using alcohol.  I do not think we do.  That is the real importance of this study.  We know what reported use is, but what is actual use?  That is where the discrepancy lies.  It is not that we are not asking.  We are asking but it is the validity of the information we are getting that is the issue.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the children's hospital and our proposed new tri-location with the children's hospital and St. James's Hospital, we are delighted the children's hospital will be around the corner from where we are.

We have not been given timelines in respect of our move and it is really important we continue to build all the links with the new children's hospital and St. James's Hospital.  Many of our clinicians are shared appointments across the sites and it is very important we continue to facilitate streamlined access - building those links prior to any physical location.  It is very important we continue to invest in our facilities on our current campus because it may be ten years or more before we move and our current services and systems are unable to continue to deliver a service that would see us past that stage.  Investment on our current site and in our services and facilities is paramount long before any proposed relocation.

To be honest, it was very useful information.  It is also sad to realise that it is so patchy throughout the country, we lack so much data and we obviously need a national study.  We have no data on alcohol and we know what our relationship with alcohol is like in this country.  In respect of babies being born with the syndrome and the fact it might be only one per year, due to the fact we have no data and babies do not present with symptoms immediately, I presume, rightly or wrongly, that many children are misdiagnosed later because there are no data to tie into the syndrome.

If we get a urine sample from a mother who delivers today or from a baby who is born today in the Rotunda who we think is withdrawing, we pick up methadone and heroin from a few days or a week earlier.  The cocaine will be long gone even if she has taken it that morning so the only way we can actually accurately detect cocaine is, again, in a stool sample or hair follicle, which will have a three-month lifespan.  This is technically easy to do but, again, needs funding.  I would have said when I came back in 2007 when everything was still up and running with the Celtic tiger that we would have seen a lot more and it was definitely linked with certain anomalies such as gastroschisis, which is a bowel problem that a baby can be born with.  We feel, as does Justin, who is the liaison midwife, that it has probably reduced.  It may be resurfacing but in the more middle-class to wealthy areas where it is a more expensive recreational drug.  It is difficult to detect it in the baby in the same way we detect other things but it can be done.  It just needs resourcing.  A baby will not withdraw from it in the same manner as a baby withdrawing from an opiate so it is more difficult to identify in the baby.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015092400002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adrienne Foran"},{"type":"speech","time":1443083400,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comments on the national children's hospital.

My grandson was not sick but he was in there for a reason.  In respect of being in a room where one could even put in a cot and possibly a chair, one looked at very sick children being confined to very small rooms.  The staff were doing their best, but in the long run, we need a new hospital.
