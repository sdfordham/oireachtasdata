He is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the minutes of previous meetings.  Are the minutes of meetings from 15 May, 16 May, 23 May and 24 May agreed?  Agreed.  There is one matter arising out of the minutes from the meeting of 24 May.  It regards category B correspondence, No. 1277, which we discussed last week.  The correspondence in question is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and he provided much helpful and useful information regarding unfinished housing estates, the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, the local authority mortgage resolutions arrears process and the taking in charge of estates.  The resolutions process dealt with the number of repossessions obtained by local authorities.  People will have seen the figures, which were quite high in some areas but not in others.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up that letter asking Mr. McCarthy to supply information relating to evictions achieved by local authorities.  We have the figure for repossessions involving people with shared ownership loans and mortgages - they are staggering in some counties - but we would like to see the figures for evictions achieved by local authorities.  We would also like to see which were done on foot of a court order or otherwise, as the case may be.  We know people have been evicted for non-payment of rents and possibly other reasons.  It would be useful to get that information for each of the past three years, taking in 2015 to 2017, inclusive.  I would like to get the figure from the voluntary housing associations funded by the taxpayer as well.  It is a matter we have not touched but when we saw the figure for repossessions by local authorities, the next question would be in respect of tenants in voluntary housing associations and evictions achieved.  This takes in local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  We should get the information and take it from there when we get it.  Is it agreed to seek that additional information?  Agreed.  Members should understand that it is about following up the excellent information provided on the previous occasion.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A refers to briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1333A is from the office of the chief administrative officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, enclosing the internal audit report of the ICT payments process.  We will note and publish this.  There was a previous report provided to the committee.  No. 1344A is from the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, providing his opening statement.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers to follow up previous meetings of the committee.  There are a number of items in this category, starting with a letter from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen of the State Claims Agency, as well as correspondence from the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I want to group these together in one discussion as different letters have popped up.  We will come to it in a moment but I would like to get the other items of correspondence out of the way.  Is that okay?<\/p> <p>  No. 1329 is correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Deputy O'Brien had a query about this matter, which regards the contract with the new national lottery operator and assurances given with respect to unclaimed prizes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>This is seeking further information.

If a commitment was given, we want to know if it was followed through into the subsequent contract.  The commitment is to go through the transcripts of the debate on the legislation.  Deputy Howlin brought it through when he was Minister.  I was a spokesperson for the Opposition dealing with it.  I have not checked the record but I suspect the item would have come up for discussion.  I would be surprised if it did not.  Deputy McDonald was probably part of the committee when we discussed the matter.  We will go through the debates relating to the passage of the legislation allowing the national lottery to be essentially privatised.  We can perform a search for the term \"unclaimed prizes\" and see what discussion took place and if the then Minister gave any commitments on the matter.  When we get that, we can follow through.

Mr. Mitchell requests that as Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross report is subject to a Garda investigation and that we do not publish it in unredacted form or deal with it publicly.  Can we note this, we might discuss it tonight but I have looked at some of this?  This matter has been aired very publicly on the national airwaves.  I am discussing this now briefly and I am asking people not to say anything that might implicate any particular individual because if there are Garda investigations under way we will certainly not cut across those.  However, I think there are matters on the internal audit that are smack bang within the remit of this committee to discuss and we will do that so I hope people will understand what I am saying there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I had raised this first.  I had asked that we write to the HSE to request a copy of the audit.  I fully appreciate the request that we do not discuss someone in detail for the reason the Chair gave that it is subject to a Garda investigation and some of the individuals involved have a right to protection as well so I have no difficulty with that.  The one thing I took from the audit itself and what was in the media reports, because a lot of this is in the media, was the attitude of the organisation as a corporate body to the audit.  I found it to be quite shocking to be honest.  Leaving aside all the issues which we will not go into, it was the response from the organisation to the audit that shocked me.  We see lots of audits and reports where there is a finding or an opinion, whether it is a Comptroller and Auditor General report or an internal audit report and an organisation may not agree fully with the finding or the recommendations.  There would be some commentary but it seemed to me that the attitude of the corporate body was \"nothing to see here, hands off and how dare you even come in and ask questions\".  That seemed to me be the attitude so there are certainly issues for the PAC.  We always look at process and whether the governance issues that should have been in place were robust and it seems they were not.  We have been here before so this is not the first of the section 38 organisations that have been before us unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  If I remember correctly, when I raised this we had the HSE in some time ago where we discussed generally what improvements were being made and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was saying that improvements had been made on the back of our meetings and the work the HSE was doing and that the issues in this audit go back to a period a number of years ago where improvements have happened since.  It might be unfair to us to say that there is still a huge problem but these issues still need to be ventilated some way.  Maybe I will leave it at that and if we want to deal with it in private session or under our work programme we can but I certainly think we need to examine some of the issues.  I am open to how we do that and I am deeply conscious of what the Chair said at the start as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am conscious of that.

These are facts.  The property was later sold for &euro;37,500 without being put up for sale on the open market which resulted in a loss based on the original estimated value and the cost incurred.

I note that Deputy Darragh O'Brien has indicated.  Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. John Connaghan, director general of the HSE.  Interestingly, he was the interim director general last week but he has written his signature above the title of director general on correspondence that was issued this week.  I believe he has a big job ahead of him.  We were concerned because we were given evidence that people had informed the State Claims Agency that all of the women involved had been informed about their audit, whereas the State Claims Agency wrote back last week and said very straight that this was inaccurate, so we asked the HSE to respond accordingly.  We need to discuss the matter, which is a culmination of some of these issues in CervicalCheck.  I ask the secretariat to display the letter, No. 1348, on the screen so everyone has it in front of them.  People can view the correspondence on the screen now.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>At the request of the HSE, SCA officials met with officials of the HSE, including Mr J Gleeson Programme Manager CervicalCheck.<br \/><br \/>The purpose of the meeting was to clarify the apparent difference as to the content of a telephone call between the SCA legal team and Mr J Gleeson which occurred during the trial of V Phelan v HSE and another.  The context of the telephone call was to discuss matters pertaining specifically to the case.  The issue of all the other women (the subject matter of the audit) being informed arose as a brief discussion issue.<br \/><br \/>While Mr Gleeson cannot recollect the specifics of the conference call with the SCA in April 2018, we clarified Mr Gleeson's understanding was consistent with the record of the call.  Mr Gleeson's understanding of the communication with the women was that at the time he assumed the women had been informed by their treating physicians.  We now know that this was not the case.<br \/><br \/>Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved.<\/blockquote> <p>Obviously that is to the satisfaction of the HSE and the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p> My issue, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is we are given very definitive, categoric evidence in public session and immediately afterwards we find it is not the case.  That is a problem for the committee in terms of witnesses appearing before us.  It is not about the cervical cancer issue; it is about evidence.  The committee has to have an absolute assurance that evidence given here is correct because if it is not correct we are all on the wrong track.  That is the issue I am concerned with.  Deputy O'Brien indicated he wished to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#D03700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am not happy with this and I will tell the Chairman why.  The issue is not whether Mr. Gleeson was of the understanding the women had been informed or not.  The issue was he sat in that chair and said he did not have a conversation with the SCA and he did not tell them that all of the women had been informed.  It is not an issue of whether he was of that belief or not.  He categorically said he did not speak with the SCA and neither did anyone from CervicalCheck.  That is the issue.  He cannot now come back and say that he had the conversation, that he told them this, that he was under that belief and that is now resolved.  The issue around the HSE and the agency may be resolved in the context of the apparent difference in understanding of whether women were told or not.  I do not want to use the word \"lie\", but we have somebody who came before a committee and who did not give us accurate information and even denied having a conversation, and now we know that not only did he have the conversation, he said what we all knew at that meeting.

In that scenario, we have to question having confidence in a management team that appears before the committee and gives information that, for whatever reason, is inaccurate.  Not alone is it inaccurate but it is based on a case that was in the High Court.  This is pretty serious stuff and we will have to have a discussion about what we do about this.  If the SCA had not written to us last week, we would be none the wiser.  It begs the other question: what else is inaccurate?  What else do we not know about?  It raises a serious question for Mr. Connaghan.  What will he do about it?  He has a management team, previous and current, that has given inaccurate information to the Committee of Public Accounts based on a High Court case.  If Vicky Phelan had signed the confidentiality clause, we would not even be talking about it in the first place.  This raises deeper questions.  We should write to the SCA, verify that it agrees 100% with the context and the way in which the letter was written and ask if it has any other further clarifications or information it wants to give to us.  Second, we have to seriously consider the impact of being given information like this which is completely inaccurate for us and which is based on other evidence given to us.

As I simply do not accept that at face value, I believe Mr. Gleeson has to appear before us again.<\/p><p> We should not, however, miss the bigger point, which is what An Teachta Kelly was getting at.  I am giving my opinion from what I have heard.  We look at process failures and systems failures but there is a sense that a deliberate strategy was put in place to limit the number of women made aware of the results.  That is the bigger issue.  In my view, Mr. Gleeson was at the core of the decision-making in that regard.  I do not believe that issue should be lost in the confusion over emails and what was said or not said.  The Committee of Public Accounts should produce a report from that perspective and should not encroach on the work of Mr. Scally or anyone else.  We have had a number of meetings, however, and cannot just bookend them saying we have had discussions with witnesses because we have our job to do.<\/p><p> There were three elements to the strategy.  One was to limit the number of women who knew.  The second was to get those who knew and who had legal recourse to sign confidentiality clauses.  Where that did not work, the third element was to drag it out through the courts.  Ms Vicky Phelan rumbled all that.  That is my sense of it.  It is only my sense of it so I am not speaking for the committee.  I do not believe we can forget the strategy.<\/p><p> As the Chairman knows, some of the women involved were in Leinster House again yesterday.  Some of them are still taking cases in the High Court.  Women who are dying are still in the High Court fighting the system.  We have to have their backs.  Deputy Fleming, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, promised them that we would fight their corner for them so we cannot just drop the matter and say that is it.  At the very least, we have to produce a report and give our view on whether we feel there were systems values.  I know the word \"cover-up\" was used by the solicitor for Ms Phelan.  That is still an allegation.  I do not believe Mr. Scally will be looking at that.  I would imagine that if there were failures he will come back and state that.  Then we will need a commission of investigation.  If that happens, it will be locked into a two-year process whereby nobody will be able to talk about the matter again.  That is what happens with these commissions.  We have been here before with all these issues.  I am just making the point that we started a process and made a commitment and promise to the victims at the centre of this.  Not only because we made a commitment, but because of our responsibility, we need to see it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#E02800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I find the letter shocking.  I have serious questions over the fact that the director general has put his name to this.  I am not given to extreme statements but am inclined to make one when I see a new director general coming forward in a situation like this, where there was clear evidence from the State Claims Agency, to say he decided to bring the two together to have a meeting.  We have no minutes of that meeting.  He refers to an \"apparent difference\".  There was nothing apparent about it; there was a difference.  Now we are talking about apparent differences, assumptions and consistencies.  There is something seriously amiss.  I find this letter totally unacceptable.  The last line states: \"Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved.\"  As a member of this committee, I believe nothing has been resolved for me.  There was no \"apparent difference\".  It has already been said this is a very serious issue.  We have only a very limited, specific role in it.  When we are given differing accounts as evidence, it is then up to us, not the HSE, to make decisions on how to resolve it.  The representatives of the organisations in question, including the director general, need to appear before us again.  We will hear what has been said and we will make conclusions in our report.  We have no choice but to do that.  I say that most reluctantly because there is a much bigger issue here for the women.  We need an investigation as quickly as possible.

If the HSE is saying that is the misunderstanding and that the State Claims Agency and HSE are now happy it has been clarified, that is the end of the matter.

The combined expenditure under those arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;27.8 million.  Within that total, expired contracts had been extended beyond the specified contract end date for 27 procurements with combined expenditure of just over &euro;20 million.  This included procurement of information and communications technology, ICT, goods and services, some of which were the focus of the internal audit examination being considered by the committee today.<\/p> <p>  More generally, I would point out that, as part of the annual audit of accounts of financial statements, we review the work and outputs of internal audit units.

These include the management of the emergency 999 communications control centre; incident recording; criminal investigations; fingerprints; registration of EU nationals; and international policing and security co-operation and information exchange.<\/p> <p>  In addition, ICT is being increasingly used in new ways to support the organisation&rsquo;s daily activities in areas such as strategic planning, data analysis and modelling of the organisation and its functions.<\/p> <p>  In delivering such services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always been very conscious of the need to ensure the ICT budget available to it is maximised and is invested in a cost effective manner.  Despite its capital budget being reduced by 50% as a result of the recession and the level of staffing being below those of other Departments, the Garda ICT department has successfully delivered a number of major projects, such as the TETRA radio communications network, e-vetting and an automated number plate recognition system that have enhanced the delivery of policing and security services.<\/p> <p>  Delivering these kinds of new services, as well as maintaining ICT services to an organisation of more than 15,000 people who work in a very complex environment, would not have been possible without a comprehensive approach to governance and project management.<\/p> <p>  In line with other public sector bodies, the annual Garda ICT budget is approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  Annual ICT expenditure is reviewed regularly in that given year by the executive director of Garda ICT.  In addition, it is subject to review by the ICT governance board, which is chaired by the chief administrative officer, and includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ICT governance board meets on a quarterly basis.<\/p> <p>  A key element of the organisation&rsquo;s modernisation and renewal programme is the need to upgrade, replace and develop new ICT systems.  In taking on these initiatives, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faced the challenge of progressing ICT projects where the number of people employed in ICT is significantly lower than in similarly sized public sector organisations.  As a result, and, additionally, in order to maintain critical policing and national security ICT systems on a 24-7, 365 days a year basis, it was necessary for the ICT department to avail of a very significant level of external skilled resources.<\/p> <p>  By their nature, given the range of ICT services to be provided and supported, contracts with suppliers can be very complex.  The skilled resource contract with the largest provider of external resources to the organisation commenced in 2009.  The contract has been rolled over to ensure the continued operation of ICT services and, given the complex nature of the procurement required, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged the assistance of a specialist ICT service to assist developing a procurement approach which would maximise competition opportunities.  A series of tenders have issued, with more currently progressing, and contracts with a number of different suppliers have been awarded.  Over this period, the cost of the existing contract was carefully managed, with the average cost per resource decreased by 8%.<\/p> <p>  The report by the Garda internal audit service raised a number of issues, which are being addressed.  For instance, since last year, all external staff working under the skilled resource contract in ICT are subject to the Garda electronic time recording system.<\/p> <p>  Since receiving the approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework to tender for new skilled resources, a series of procurement competitions have commenced.  To maximise competition options, the existing contract has been broken into five tenders for different services, namely, ICT service desk provision; IT operations; ICT security; ICT application development; and support for the strategic transformation office.  These tenders are at different stages of the procurement process.  Subject to the outcome of the five tender processes, which are independent and operate via open competition, we would anticipate that reliance on a single provider in this area will significantly reduce.<\/p> <p>  Over the past year, the number of inhouse skilled resources in ICT has begun to increase and will increase further in the coming years.  Increased numbers and skills, combined with new structures in the ICT department, will reduce the level of dependency overall on external contractors.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of agreed rates, all rates are contained in the master services agreement and annual project documents.  There are no verbally agreed rates.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the internal audit service raised the issue of pre-payments.  The decision to apply prepayments is in line with the overall Garda budgeting process and has resulted in a 5.5% discount.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, ICT plays a fundamental role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na providing a service that protects and supports communities.  We fully recognise the need to ensure that investment in ICT is in line with public procurement rules and provides value for money.  Our approach to breaking-up the skilled resources contract will assist us in this and our focus on increasing the number of our personnel working in ICT will reduce our overall reliance on external contractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Deputy Alan Kelly will be the first speaker and he will have 20 minutes.

What level of credit check do the witnesses do in respect of organisations to which he makes prepayments because if they are gone, they are gone and they will not get them back?  What kind of ongoing monitoring is done in that regard?  When a contract is signed today that will run for a couple of years, it might be fine on the day the credit check is done and the contract is signed but where there is a prepayment system in place, there has to be some annual update of a credit check.  Sometimes the published financial statements might provide hints.

Perhaps it is half serious.<\/p> <p>  Five weeks ago, we went through all this in the justice committee.  I asked a range of questions which Mr. Nugent came back to me on late last night.  I have the answers on my phone.  The answers to my questions, which were meant to be delivered within two weeks, were sent yesterday, five weeks later, and they were not satisfactory.  I will go through some of them but they were not satisfactory.  I had to chase for the answers.  I will get back to them.  I used the phrase \"cat and mouse\" but that is what is going on because trying to get straight answers to a number of questions is borderline impossible at this stage.  <\/p> <p>  Well done on the audit, which was necessary.  There needs to be an investigation into the way in which some of these contracts were handled.  I say this with officials of the Department of Justice and Equality present and with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality watching proceedings.  There should be an investigation into how contracts in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to some companies were handled because of the volume of money and the lack of procurement processes.  Mr. Kelly has outlined it.  It is not acceptable in modern times that this would happen with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it would not enforce procurement rules in respect of rolling contracts.  It is not acceptable that it would have people on site dealing with very sensitive information not clocking in so it would have no knowledge of what they are doing, how they are doing it or what hours they are doing.  The audit states, \"No assurances can be given that procurement rules were being followed on major IT contracts in the force\".  It stated that there was a lack of a paper trail over key financial agreements.  I ask Mr. Kelly whether that is correct.<\/p> <p>  I presume acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in has read this audit in detail and I presume he has taken action as a consequence.

Mr. Kelly has agreed that the contract was within the proper timeframes up until 2014.  Between 2009 and 2014 that contract was valid.  There was a period in 2015 when it was out of date.

Therefore, there is governance in place.  Those boards meet quarterly.  Subordinate to those, there are individual project boards which deal with the internal projects on which we are working within the projects.  On a routine basis, within ICT, I manage money monthly.

Mr. McCarthy is telling us there is &euro;11 million concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope that never creates a problem.  I am sure, now that we have raised the issue, we will be coming back to the Comptroller and Auditor General to find out its extent across all Government bodies.  Between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement, somebody needs to get a handle on the matter to ensure we are not here next year finding &euro;3 million had been issued in prepayments to a contractor that went bust.  I need to see lessons learned across the public service from what happened in DIT.  One function of the Committee of Public Accounts is to make sure the public sector learns from what went wrong.

I also welcome the ambassadors and the other members of the diplomatic corps who have taken the time to be here today.<\/p><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to address it on developments at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  I had been due to appear on 1 March but the meeting was cancelled due to adverse weather.  I am glad to say the weather is not a problem this week.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss developments at the Council, which met most recently met on Monday last.  My Department has provided a detailed information note to the committee on the wide range of issues the Foreign Affairs Council has considered in recent few months.  In the interests of maximising the time available for discussion, I propose to address only the major themes<b><\/b>of the Council's discussions in my opening remarks. <\/p><p>I will first discuss Middle East issues.  I thank Deputy Niall Collins for writing a comprehensive letter to me in recent days setting out his concerns on the situation in Gaza and the broader Middle East process.  My Department and I will supply him with a detailed written reply.<\/p><p>Naturally, in what has been a period of upheaval and tragedy, the Middle East peace process<b><\/b>has been one of the most frequent topics on the Foreign Affairs Council's agenda and was discussed in September 2017, and again at the meetings of the Council in December 2017 and January and February of this year.  The December meeting was held just after the US announcement on moving its embassy to Jerusalem and we discussed the unambiguous negative impact this would have, as we made clear at the time.  There was also an informal breakfast with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, which allowed for a useful and frank conversation.  The level of EU unity in support of a two-state solution was notable.  I used the opportunity to speak about the damage that the continued construction of settlements on Palestinian land is doing to prospects for peace and a new peace initiative.<\/p><p>At the January Council meeting, we discussed how best we could support the Palestinian leadership in its efforts to keep the hopes of the population focused on a political track.  We restated our support for the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.  I highlighted the need to support the Palestinian leadership and expressed deep concerns about the untenable situation in Gaza.  On numerous occasions, I have appealed to the United States to review its decision on UNRWA funding.  We had an informal lunch with President Abbas at which we reiterated the European Union's strong support for a two-state solution in a constructive discussion.  We had a further discussion on the Middle East peace process at the February Council meeting.  We also had an exchange with some of the key Arab foreign ministers on this issue, focusing on the prospects for a US peace initiative. <\/p><p>I requested that Gaza be added to the agenda for the Foreign Affairs Council meeting last Monday, following the shocking events there in recent weeks.  Even before recent events in Gaza, this has been a difficult and dispiriting period, with ongoing settlement construction, demolitions and restrictions on economic development making the path forward ever more difficult.  Decisions such as the announcement last week of further settlement construction and a court judgment on the Bedouin community of Khan al-Amar are extremely worrying and threaten to directly erode the physical space that is needed to establish a Palestinian state in the future.<\/p><p>I have also strongly condemned rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel, which undermine the Palestinian cause and are counterproductive in terms of alleviating humanitarian suffering in Gaza.  That situation is worsening and efforts to restore Palestinian Authority governance in Gaza seem to have stalled for now.  The US announcement on moving its embassy to Jerusalem was a disappointing and premature development and has, undoubtedly, complicated US efforts to bring forward a successful peace initiative.  Ireland has been to the fore in pressing for constructive EU action on this issue and we have kept it high on our agenda.  I have visited the region twice to meet all of the key players and I will visit again next week, something which has informed my contributions to EU discussions. <\/p><p>The situation in Libya<b><\/b>was on the agenda for the Council meeting in July 2017 and, again, in January 2018 when the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Libya, Mr. Ghassan Salam&eacute;, joined our discussions.  Ministers share a deep concern about the appalling abuses that have been reported against migrants in Libya.  They agreed on the importance of supporting the work done by UN agencies to improve conditions for migrants, and of working with countries of origin to address migration generally.  I am glad some progress has been made in that area.  The restoration of stable government in Libya, where the rule of law can be implemented across the territory of the country, is essential to bringing a permanent end to these abuses.  It was useful for us to discuss with the UN special representative his plans to bring the parties together and prepare for elections. <\/p><p>The influence of Iran on the region is worrying and negative, especially the support the country has provided to the regime of President Assad.  Nevertheless, Ireland believes the Iran nuclear deal shows how multilateral political action can help to de-escalate some of the world's worst security challenges.  Ireland firmly supports non-proliferation and we believe the entire Middle East should be a zone that is free of weapons of mass destruction.  The situation in Iran was discussed at the Council meetings of October 2017, March and April 2018 and earlier this week.  The EU has been united in its support for the Iran nuclear agreement and we were deeply disappointed that the US has decided to withdrawn from the agreement.  The EU continues to be committed to the deal as long as Iran fulfils its obligations under the agreement.  I call on the other parties, likewise, to remain committed to an agreement to which we all signed up.<\/p><p>There are a number of complex and interlinked conflicts in the Middle East region.  It was useful, therefore, to have a broader discussion in December on recent developments across the Middle East.  This discussion allowed us to touch on the linkages between the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, Lebanon and the Gulf crisis.  Our discussions stressed the primacy of the UN's Geneva process on Syria and the need for accountability; the need for unity and dialogue in Iraq; support for stability and the upcoming elections in Lebanon; and the need for continued support in Jordan.  On Iran, there was agreement that the EU should continue to engage on and through the nuclear deal, but also that we address Iran's regional activities and ballistic missiles programme, which is worrying.  My intervention focused on Syria and Yemen.  I called for the EU to make a political contribution in support of a negotiated solution in Yemen and to intensify our efforts to make progress in that regard.  I also raised, in a focused way, the need to get humanitarian access and assistance to civilians in Yemen in the context of a war-torn country.<\/p><p>There was a more detailed discussion on Syria at the February, March and April meetings of the Council.  The position is Syria is increasingly desperate and there have been appalling attacks on civilians, as we will all have seen regularly on media broadcasts.  Outside involvement is fuelling and sustaining this conflict.  Ministers agreed on the need for a strong push to restart the UN's Geneva process.  There is also a concern that the reignition of fighting in a number of areas may take the pressure off ISIS, which had lost most of its territory in the past year but has not disappeared. <\/p><p>The Council meeting of April discussed the western Balkans in preparation for the summit that took place last week on 17 May.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European perspective of the western Balkans.  I was pleased the support Ministers expressed for the current focus on the region was reflected in a successful summit in Sofia, Bulgaria.  We agree on the need to encourage the western Balkans to continue to vigorously pursue reforms and that the European Union needs to give practical assistance.  The stability of the region is important to the security of the EU and we need to be sure our message is communicated effectively.<\/p><p> The March Foreign Affairs Council had a discussion on Ukraine which covered progress on implementation of the national reform programme and the ongoing conflict in the east of the country.  The High Representative updated Ministers on her visit to Ukraine a few days earlier, where she reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s unwavering support for Ukraine&rsquo;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Ministers agreed that significant progress had been made on the reforms, while noting that much more still needed to be done.<\/p><p> On Russia, in March the UK updated Ministers on the Salisbury nerve agent attack and the Council expressed its full solidarity and support for the UK.  At the April Foreign Affairs Council, member states stressed the need for EU unity on Russia and upheld the validity of the five guiding principles for the relationship, which have served the EU well.  Several states urged greater support for civil society in Russia.  On sanctions, there was broad agreement that the lack of progress on implementation of the Minsk agreement and Russia&rsquo;s unwillingness to engage constructively in the trilateral contact group negotiations made it inevitable that the restrictive sanctions measures would remain in place.<\/p><p> In March Ministers discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula with the South Korean Foreign Minister, who gave a generally optimistic assessment of developments with the DPRK.  High-level talks held between the Republic of Korea and the DPRK since then, and the prospect of direct talks with the US, are an encouraging signal which can be conducive to fostering trust and de-escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula as a whole.  This is positive news.  Nevertheless, along with our EU partners, we remain conscious that similar initiatives in the past have not worked out, despite significant political and financial investment.  We are also conscious of the DPRK&rsquo;s serial breaching of UN Security Council resolutions on missile testing and nuclear detonations as well as its appalling human rights record.<\/p><p> Ireland continues therefore to support the EU&rsquo;s policy of critical engagement with the DPRK, which was reaffirmed during our discussion in March.  This combines pressure with sanctions and other measures while keeping communication and dialogue channels open.  The EU is also maintaining dialogue with third countries such as China in order to ensure that restrictive measures are being implemented in an effective way.  Ireland continues to provide some humanitarian assistance in the DPRK via the World Food Programme and through international NGOs operating in North Korea.<\/p><p> The Foreign Affairs Council has considered the follow-up to the EU-African Union summit held in Abidjan last November.  If the relationship between the African Union and the EU is to be productive and constructive, we must meet more frequently and at the highest political levels, over the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> In addition, the Council has been considering the forthcoming negotiations with African, Caribbean and Pacific states on a successor to the current Cotonou partnership agreement which expires in 2020.  The Cotonou Agreement is a comprehensive partnership for economic, social and cultural development of the three regions.  The EU&rsquo;s aim is for a new partnership, called post-Cotonou, which re-energises relations and which emphasises regular and high-level political engagement.  The Council this week agreed to further work on the negotiating mandate.  I would like to get the committee's views on this matter.  My view currently is that the political infrastructure currently in place between Europe and Africa is totally unfit for purpose and we need to put an entirely new structure in place for the kind of engagement that will be needed to help the continent of Africa and Europe to deal through partnership with the multiple challenges Africa faces, including climate change, food security, energy security, water security, migration, corruption, regional conflict and so much more besides in the context of an extra 1 billion people on the continent of Africa in the next 25 years.  These are massive challenges which I believe should be prioritised in terms of the future of Europe and its impact globally.<\/p><p> Aside from considering day-to-day foreign policy issues, the Foreign Affairs Council has also been discussing how the EU can promote a rules-based international order with multilateralism as its key principle and the UN at its core.  The EU global strategy sets out a vision for foreign and security policy.  It commits the Union to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.<\/p><p> The Council has been monitoring progress on the implementation of the strategy.  In the area of security and defence this includes strengthening the EU&rsquo;s peacekeeping capacity in support of the United Nations.  We have also made progress on implementing a strategic approach to strengthening the resilience of states and societies in our neighbourhood and in developing an integrated approach to conflicts and crises.  Unfortunately there is no shortage of them.  A particular priority in the time ahead will be the EU&rsquo;s role in strengthening multilateralism and global governance.<\/p><p> I know PESCO has had considerable debate in our Parliament.  PESCO was formally launched at the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December.  Twenty-five member states are participating.  The Irish Government approved participation on 21 November and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval was obtained on 7 December in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This enabled Ireland to participate in PESCO from the outset.<\/p><p> For us PESCO is a tool for member states to jointly develop the essential capabilities necessary to carry out peacekeeping tasks in missions in Lebanon, Mali and elsewhere.  PESCO can only operate in that context, anchored within the global strategy and bound to all the other measures &ndash; prevention, mediation, diplomatic, development, economic &ndash; that form part of the EU&rsquo;s integrated approach to situations of conflict and crisis.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s participation will enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; capabilities for a wide range of United Nations-mandated missions where they must be able to work with contingents from other countries.  It allows the men and women of our Defence Forces to gain access to the latest equipment and training, which enhances their ability to participate safely and effectively in challenging peacekeeping missions.  Twenty-five of the 28 member states are participating, including other member states such as Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Sweden which are neutral or not members of any military alliance, which, of course, is also the case for Ireland.<\/p><p> The deployment of the Defence Forces overseas on peacekeeping missions will continue to be governed by the triple lock which requires UN authority and approval by the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> Any capabilities developed or equipment procured under PESCO belong to the member states individually and any deployments remain a decision solely for the member state concerned in accordance with its legal and constitutional requirements.  In other words, this is voluntary.  We buy into the projects and assignments that we want to under the structures of PESCO.  Therefore there is no undermining of Irish neutrality or the issues linked to it.<\/p><p> Maximising the potential of the EU&rsquo;s military and civilian Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, is another priority.  Civilian missions have traditionally focused on the need to strengthen the police, rule of law and civilian administration in host countries.  New and increasing challenges such as cyber and hybrid threats, organised crime, counterterrorism and irregular migration are now forming part of these missions&rsquo; work.  These new challenges will mean changes to the way CSDP operates to ensure that it is as responsive and as effective as possible.<\/p><p> Good progress has already been made here.  There is strong commitment that more can be done, including on preparing a new civilian capabilities development plan in the first half of this year and a civilian CSDP compact by the end of this year.  My Department currently seconds a total of 12 civilian experts in eight of the ten civilian CSDP missions in Europe, the Middle East, and in Libya, Somalia and the Sahel.  Eight members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also deployed to the EU&rsquo;s mission in Kosovo.  It is vital that they have the tools they need to operate effectively.  That is what the co-operation with other EU countries is all about.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to update the committee on what has been a wide-ranging agenda at the Foreign Affairs Council.

It is no secret that I think Ireland needs to put a convincing roadmap in place to get us to where we promised we would be, which is to commit 0.7% of our gross national income to development aid funding.  To put that into context, we are currently spending &euro;700 million a year on development aid.  If we were to get to 0.7% by 2030, which is a target we would like to certainly focus on, we would have to get to spending &euro;2.5 billion by then.  That is the kind of scale of increased expenditure that one is talking about.  It is not easy to factor that into budgets because it means very significant increases annually, even if one is to do it over a ten-year period or more.  We are currently talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach about that.<\/p> <p>  I have strong views on this issue.  We are currently spending below 0.3%, not because we have reduced funding in this area - in fact, we increased our development aid funding in the previous budget by &euro;25 million - but because our economy is growing at such a pace that to simply stand still and not reduce the percentage of GNI that relates to overseas development aid, ODA, one would have to spend between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million extra.  This is a difficult challenge for us.  If our economy was standing still it would be much easier to do this but we have an economy that is growing at the fastest pace in Europe for the fourth year in a row.  When a country is in deep recession, when we have to make hard choices to support our own people and to provide basic services and supports for them, that is one matter but when we have an economic growth story such as we have right now, in my view, we have an obligation to the poorest of the poor.<\/p> <p>  We have a good track record in how we spend money on overseas aid programmes.  We will launch a White Paper process to review that and to modernise it.  In the coming weeks, we will also launch our global footprint plan between now and 2025.  One will see much discussion and activity around the role of overseas aid, in terms of Ireland's contribution globally, particularly in the developing world and on the continent of Africa.  One will also see commitments, which we will need Opposition parties to support us on, to prioritise increased expenditure at budget time to make a roadmap to 0.7% real because it is easy to promise these goals for 2030 or beyond but not make the financial choices and decisions in advance of the budget for next year.  This will require hard choices.  Obviously, the more support we get from this committee and from other political parties, the easier it is for us to do that.  I am absolutely committed to a credible route to 0.7% and the significant expenditure increases that will be required to get us there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Libya, as a former Minister for Defence, I am quite familiar with this issue.  As Deputy Niall Collins will be aware, we have had naval ships on and off in the Mediterranean, largely picking up refugees who have come from Libya to the shores around Tripoli.  It is a desperately tragic story.  The conditions in many of the camps on the shoreline are horrific.  There are many stories of sexual abuse and rape of women.  There are many horrific stories of people trafficking, basically, people being put into boats that are not at all seaworthy and that everybody knows will not make it 15 miles, never mind across the Mediterranean.  This is a tragic situation that the European Union has focused on, and is spending a lot of money and a lot of political capital on trying to help to resolve.  In April of last year, the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection for migrants and to reinforce migration measures in Libya.  The &euro;90 million is in addition to &euro;120 million already announced for migration related support for Libya.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's contribution is essentially through an EU contribution, which we obviously contribute to.  We do not have a bilateral ODA support programme in Libya.  The main reason for that is because we do not have any presence in Libya.  Normally, when we have priority countries with aid programmes, we have a government that we can negotiate with that we get transparency from, in terms of how funding is spent and how programmes operate, etc.  In Libya, it is difficult to do that.  There are security and governance issues and we have done it, essentially, by supporting EU funding programmes to date.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy would have heard me call for an international investigation into the violence in Gaza in recent weeks.  I refer to the 110 Palestinians that have been shot, many of them a long way from the border wall.  The credible approach here is to insist on an independent inquiry on what happened.  Israelis will defend their actions.  Palestinians will also make very credible arguments in terms of what happened here and the tragic consequences.  We have supported and sponsored a session in the human rights council.  We are not a member of the human rights council but we have been supportive of a motion which has supported the setting up of an independent inquiry, which will find it difficult to do its work because I do not think Israel will co-operate.  I still think it is a useful exercise.  There needs to be accountability when there is this kind of violent engagement where so many people have been killed because of military interventions and the use of live ammunition largely on unarmed crowds, which is what happened.<\/p><p>The cross-party debate we have had in the D&aacute;il on the issue reflects the concern in Ireland in that regard.<\/p><p> History will judge the global powers harshly for what has been allowed to happen and what continues to happen in Syria.  There are a number of processes to try to make political progress that will make a ceasefire stick and last.  In truth, I am not sure if any of them is working.  The one we support strongly is the Geneva process.  The ongoing violence in Syria has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people, while countless others have been injured and displaced.  The numbers displaced run into millions.  I have condemned the violence on numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il and reiterate that condemnation.  Together with other countries, Ireland states there is a need to give strong political support to the Geneva process in an effort to try to bring some political stability to a country that has been and continues to be torn apart by war.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided more than &euro;109 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the conflict, including almost &euro;25 million last year and over &euro;16 million so far this year.  It includes the provision of support within Syria and also for countries in the region, including, in particular, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey which are host countries for large numbers of refugees.  At the UN hosted pledge conference for Syria and the region that took place in Brussels on 25 April Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance in 2018, thus maintaining the same level of assistance we provided last year.  Given the very significant level of ongoing need, Ireland also made a commitment to provide multi-year predictable funding beyond 2018.<\/p><p> One of the things I will be doing next week when I am in Jordan is visiting refugee camps.  Countries such as Jordan and Libya are doing extraordinary things in trying to incorporate hundreds of thousands of refugees.  When European countries talk about trying to manage migrants and refugees, the numbers of thousands are often in single digits.  We should spare a thought for countries such as Lebanon where half of the population are refugees.  Jordan and Turkey are dealing with enormous numbers of refugees.  We have an obligation to assist in any way we can with monetary and policy support.  Next Tuesday I am due to leave very early to travel to Jordan.  Jordan and Egypt are important strategic countries in the context of the Middle East peace process.  I have been to Egypt in recent months.  The last time I travelled to Israel and Palestine, I travelled to Egypt first.  This time I am visiting Amman in Jordan.  We will open an embassy in Jordan before the end of the year which, again, is reinforcing the interest Ireland has in the broader Middle East peace process.  We recognise the role Jordan plays as a stabilising country in the broader region.  We will then visit Tel Aviv and Ramallah for political meetings in Israel and Palestine.  We will then travel to Cyprus, a country which potentially has a strategic role to play in the neighbourhood as an EU member state but also as a country with a coastline that geographically is very close to Gaza and Israel.<\/p><p> I will happily come back to report on the political engagements I will have during the visit.  We have engagement at very senior political level with all of the countries mentioned.  If I meet the Israeli Prime Minister, it will be the fourth time I will have met him in nine months.  We are due to meet the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Mr. Riyad al-Mliki, and the Palestinian chief negotiator, Mr. Saeb Erekat, in Ramallah.  Likewise, I am due to meet my counterparts in Cyprus and Jordan.  That is the reason I have asked Opposition parties to give us some time and space to try to make diplomacy and politics work in the Middle East, rather than make a radical change of direction in an effort to show solidarity or express frustration at the lack of progress in the past 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#D00500","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":900,"content":"<p>My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, is critical of the lack of action by the Government, particularly in responding to events in Gaza.  The D&aacute;il collectively made its position very clear that it wanted to see some response.  That was the view expressed by most speakers from all parties.  There is an onus on us to respond to what is happening in Gaza which clearly is wrong.  We were horrified that on 14 May in Gaza the Israeli army murdered at least 59 Palestinians and injured more than 2,700 others.  The Israelis have since killed a further 121 Palestinians in Gaza, while 12,000 have been injured.  These are significant numbers.  There was an expectation arising from the meeting the T&aacute;naiste attended that there would be some agreement but clearly there was not.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views in that regard.  Will there ever be agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the Council of Foreign Ministers that the Minister attends?  There is a lot of guilt because of the treatment of the Jewish people during the Second World War.  For that reason, I do not think we will ever get agreement, but there is an onus on countries such as Ireland to stand up and do something.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday there was an escalation of the conflict, with the Israeli army responding to the use of projectiles, as mentioned by the Minister.  I thought it was interesting that the Israeli ambassador went on television when the conflict was ongoing in Gaza and spoke about Israel defending its borders.  Does the Minister know where the Israel's borders start and end?  I do not think the Palestinians know.  I do not think a lot of countries in the region know.  The Syrians do not know.  Israel occupies part of Syria.  Perhaps that is an issue that might be raised at the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I know that there was an attempt to breach the naval blockade of Gaza.  The boat was carrying patients who needed medical care, students and people who were looking for jobs in universities, but it was intercepted and many were injured on it.  Bullets were fired by the Israeli army.  We need to make a strong statement on what is happening.  I do not think Israel is listening to anybody, with the exception of President Trump when he confirmed that the United States would recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  I agree with the Minister's view that US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was disastrous and a negative step, but something needs to happen.  Ireland could recognise the state of Palestine.  Senator Frances Black has brought forward a Bill, but will the Government allow it to be debated on Second Stage to be scrutinised further?  There is also the question of banning goods from the illegal settlements.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Khan al-Ahmar, a Palestinian Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank.  Do people know that if the illegal demolition goes ahead, it will pave the way for illegal colonial settlement and construction of the EI corridor?<\/p><p>Was that possibility discussed at the meeting?  It further undermines the possibility of a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem.  Was it discussed?  The T&aacute;naiste's notes mention the forcible demolition and transfer of people, which is a war crime.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Iran.  What he said about the interest of Iran in the region was interesting.  He mentioned supporting the murderous regime of President Assad.  I agree it is a murderous regime.  The T&aacute;naiste talks about North Korea.  Is that a murderous regime?  I imagine it is but we do not use that language.  It is interesting the T&aacute;naiste has used that language in this context.  The US President unilaterally withdrew the US from the historic Iran nuclear deal.  It is reckless.

Turkey is sliding into authoritarianism.  We know that 12 MPs of one left-wing party, the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party, are in prison.

We all realise the men involved are getting older.  Some of them have died.  Anyone who reads some of the narrative concerning what was done to those men will know it was defined at the time as inhuman and degrading treatment.

Anyone who follows this case will know it is a referral process as opposed to an appeals one.  It has never happened before.  We need to get some legal guidance and that is what we are getting.  We will make a decision in the next few weeks.  I will be away next week and will miss the Cabinet meeting so it will probably be the following Tuesday.<\/p> <p>  There were a lot of questions there and I will try to go through them.  On Gaza, the Deputy said we need to do something.  I agree and that is why I have spent more time on the Middle East peace process than on any other issue outside of Brexit and other EU issues and Northern Ireland.  I do not think any other Minister in the European Union has been there three times in nine months.  Perhaps there is.  We are trying to do as much as we can.  What I did not want to do was respond in an emotional way by doing something we would regret a few weeks later because it would limit our capacity to build on the kind of relationships that I and my team have worked hard to try to build in Washington, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Cairo and hopefully in Amman and to try to help to make progress on the broader challenges we face which for the moment is to try to de-escalate the violence taking place and the tragedy on the back of that, particularly for Palestinians.<\/p> <p>  When one listens to what most parties said last week, with the exception of Sinn F&eacute;in and a few others who were calling for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and a range of other things, most parties expressed outrage but also said we need to think about how Ireland can contribute in a constructive and positive way and in a way that can help Palestinians who are incredibly vulnerable, particularly in Gaza.  They are living in impossible conditions.  I was in Gaza in January.  It has a highly educated, young population.  There are 1.8 million people living in a tiny space.  Many of the young people are in and out of Internet cafes and on their phones, just like we are here.  They know exactly what is going on but they are unable to make any progress in their own lives or their own country, as they see it.  That has led to a pressure-cooker effect that has built frustration and antagonism.  That is what drives young teenagers into radical responses which is the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.  That plays into the hands of dark forces that are trying to encourage some people into violent responses and so on.  We want the opposite.  We want to be talking in a positive sense about what is possible in Gaza and what is possible for a state of Palestine in the future in the context of a two-state solution through politics as opposed to through other ways of lashing out.  Lots of people, not only me, have predicted what has happened.<\/p><p> Without political initiatives, some progress and new thinking, living conditions in Gaza have continued to deteriorate.  I am talking about basic things such as power and water, not to mention employment opportunities - a lack of which makes life impossible.  The build-up of protest has been a response to frustration.  We need to be honest.  There were some devious elements in the protest, which encouraged violence but, by and large, the protests were driven by utter frustration.  Most people wanted to make a political point through protest rather than be part of a violent uprising.<\/p><p> We want to continue to pursue what we have been pursuing for the past ten months, which is engagement, persuasion, argument and blunt and direct discussions to challenge the existing policy direction, whether that is in Washington or in Jerusalem, Ramallah or Tel Aviv.  If it turns out to be a futile exercise and it becomes clear that no one is listening or cares what Ireland thinks, we may need to look at changing our policy approach.  The European Union has unity on a number of things such as insisting on any new initiative being based on a two-state solution, which is shared across all 28 member states.  There is a common view in respect of the criticism of the expansion of settlements and an acceptance that this is illegal and there is also a view that the humanitarian crisis, which is continuing to build in Gaza, needs a much more comprehensive response than it has received to date.  The EU is willing to put a lot of finance behind new initiatives such as a desalinisation plant and new energy projects and we have committed &euro;10 million to a new solar energy project, which we negotiated with both Israelis and Palestinians.  It will be a large solar panel project to power a desperately needed water purification plant.<\/p><p> The Deputy suggested that we were not doing anything.  We are not seeking headlines which may look good for two or three days but which do nothing to improve the lives of Palestinians.  We are lobbying for, and trying to instigate, a new peace initiative that is acceptable to Palestinians and Israelis, with parity of esteem on both sides around the negotiating table and a credible roadmap to a two-state solution.  In the meantime, we are focused on the humanitarian situation and the misery in the West Bank, especially in Gaza.  This year we will spend &euro;12 million or &euro;13 million on humanitarian support programmes with Palestinians and we will continue to support UNRWA.  We will add an extra &euro;10 million with the energy project in Gaza and we are looking to do more.  I have made this issue a big priority for the Irish Government.  I accept that Irish interventions have not resulted in any political progress yet but we do not help what we are trying to do by taking actions that may be popular for 48 hours or a week while undermining what we have been trying to do for the past year.<\/p><p> If any member has new thinking on this, or wants to speak to me privately about it, I am all ears.  We have met many experts on the Middle East peace process and I always try to educate myself on how we can progress our objectives.  My only objective here is to respect and support Palestinians and Israelis in the context of a fair outcome to a peace negotiation which, unfortunately, looks to be a long way away right now.  We will continue to build alliances, particularly with some of the neighbouring Arab countries.  Egypt has a strategic role to play in terms of Palestinian reconciliation, which is a hugely important part of the aspiration to have a Palestinian state controlled and managed by one governance bloc, that is, the Palestinian Authority.  It is difficulty to do many of the things we want to do in Gaza while Hamas continues to control it.  Egypt has been trying, largely on its own, to bring Fatah and Hamas together in a reconciliation process, which is hugely important work in which Ireland wants to assist.  I am happy to take some political risk to help and support the process if it is thought useful in light of Ireland's experience of reconciliation processes and the integration into politics and peaceful dialogue of people who were formerly committed to violence.<\/p><p> I feel very strongly about Israel and Palestine.  The easy thing would be to do what many NGOs advocate, which they are right to do because this raises the profile of issues.  If we did this, however, the Government would be seen in the same way as an NGO.  I am a politician and a Government Minister and I need to interact with other politicians and Ministers in order to find political ways forward, rather than engage in actions that are just about protest or solidarity.<\/p><p> I have been vocal on Iran and I strongly disagree with the US decision.  I think they have made a mistake.  The US sees the Iran nuclear deal in a very different way from the way we see it and it is important to understand their reasoning.  We see the nuclear deal as a nuclear deal, isolated from other issues.  Congress in Washington sees the Iran nuclear deal as part of a broader approach towards Iran.  They say they cannot agree to the continuation of the deal while Iran continues to have a ballistic missiles programme, to sponsor Hezbollah in Syria and to contribute to other conflicts in the region.  This must stop and the US has taken an absolutist approach by imposing sanctions but I believe this approach is not likely to be successful and will be destabilising.<\/p><p> The EU's approach is that, given that it took years to put a deal together to prevent nuclear armament in Iran, we need to make sure the deal remains intact.  All the indications from the inspectors who go into Iran on a regular basis, in an onerous inspections system, are that the commitments Iran made in the joint comprehensive plan of action, JCPOA, nuclear deal are being fulfilled.  I do not think that even Washington disputes this.  We have similar concerns to the US over Iran's influence on other issues but we believe they are separate issues which should be dealt with separately.<\/p><p>Currently, the discussion is focused on how the EU - along with the countries that signed up for it - protect the nuclear deal in the absence of US support.  As members know, once US sanctions are implemented, the secondary sanctions effect will have an impact on the ability of businesses not only in Iran but also those at home with businesses investing in Iran.  That is why we have seen companies like Airbus, Maersk, Total and other big European entities making decisions about pulling out or potentially pulling out of Iran because of the secondary effect of sanctions.  The countries where the companies originate are still committed to the deal but because they have a footprint in the US or a licensing issue that could be compromised, they are not willing to take the risk.  It is why the matter has become so complicated and difficult.  It is not just a case that everybody else, with the exception of the US, is remaining true to the deal.  The impact of US sanctions is very difficult to avoid, particularly in Europe, given the interconnectedness between the US and EU economies.  It is the same with China.<br\/><br\/>I have been very vocal on the matter and we are very much supporting the EU line led by Ms Federica Mogherini, who was personally involved with getting this deal across the line a few years ago and is as a result very committed to it.  So too are France, Germany and the UK.  Interestingly, despite Britain being a very strong military ally of the US, it has been very clear and vocal on the matter, as has the European Union as a whole.  That said, we cannot force our companies to do anything that does not make commercial sense for them.  There are consequences here that will be difficult to cope with.<br\/><br\/>Presidential and legislative elections are due to take place on 23 December 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC.  However, there is still some doubt over whether they will take place, and if they do, whether they will be free and fair.  Ireland is also a strong supporter of the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, and is currently the eighth-largest donor to the fund since its inception.  Already in 2018, the CERF has disbursed over &euro;60 million to the DRC.  We are contributing quite a bit of money for development supports and through the European Union we are trying to support free and fair elections.  It remains to be seen as to whether they will develop in a way we would like to see.<br\/><br\/>The was a question on Ireland's role in Syria.  We must be realistic about what we can do.  We are a small country and I said before that I decided to prioritise two big policy areas outside the obvious issues of Brexit, Northern Ireland and EU and US relations.  The first is the Middle East peace process and the second is Africa.  We spend most of our &euro;700 million of development aid in Africa.  That is not to say we are not really interested in what is happening in Syria but if we are to expend political capital as a country the size of Ireland, we must pick and choose where we can try to make a difference, politically, through negotiated outcomes or solutions.<br\/><br\/>The Geneva process for Syria is UN-led and we support it.  It is not a country-based process <i>per se<\/i>, and there are some efforts going into parallel processes, particularly driven by Russia.  This is not the direction anyone in the UN wants to go.  That is why I mention the Geneva process over and over again.  Ultimately, the conflict will have to be resolved by the great powers, to use an outdated term.  It is the US and Russia that will need to agree to try to use their influence and persuasion to bring about a lasting ceasefire.  There are other big players involved but those two happen to be on different sides of the conflict.  In the meantime, countries like Ireland and many others need to contribute significantly in a financial way, which we are doing, to support refugees and, in time, the rebuilding of Syria.  We must also advocate politically for sense to prevail in the context of what happens in the Geneva process and elsewhere in bilateral discussion and dialogue.<br\/><br\/>Elections are due in Turkey on 24 June and we have called on Turkey to ensure June's elections are free and fair, with all parties and candidates given the opportunity to campaign equally and without limitations on freedom of expression.  Turkey has so far failed to address the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in its reports on the general election of November 2015 and the constitutional referendum of April 2017.  A state of emergency is ongoing in the country.  Ireland shares the EU concerns and believes it is necessary to support a climate of free and fair elections; that is not currently in place in Turkey.  I would like to visit Turkey with some of these issues in mind and I have not had the chance to do that yet, apart from flying through Istanbul on my way to Africa.  There is a real concern across the European Union about the shift towards a more authoritarian approach to governance there, as the Deputy mentioned.  It is a worry.  I am sorry about the long answers, particularly on the Middle East matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#F00900","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here.  We had the Irish element of World Vision in last week and they spoke in particular about South Sudan, another major area of catastrophe.  Approximately 2 million people have been displaced internally and 2 million people have also fled to Uganda.  These people feel it is the forgotten war and the displacement of people is on a massive scale.  Where do we stand with regard to South Sudan?<\/p> <p>  My bailiwick is the visa issue.  We have been inundated with refusals of visas, particularly J1s and, more important, E2s this year.  Senators Mark Daly, Conway and I met staff from the embassy and it was a very strong discussion that happened approximately two months ago.  Many Deputies and Senators were irate at the time because there were so many refusals.  We want to cool it down a bit and we met those officials as a result.  There is no doubt in my mind that there has been a change in policy.  The amount of refusals this year is a multiple of last year's total.  With the economy doing so well, Irish companies are investing in the United States and trying to bring out top executives on E2 visas.  It is the same visa on which I went to the US 20 years ago.  They are being refused now, which is very worrying for companies that have already invested millions of euro.<\/p> <p>  In a recent case, an Irish builder who got his visa three years and who has 32 houses being built in Boston came home to renew his visa with his wife and two children.  The renewal was refused.  It is serious.  Senator Mark Daly backed me up but we were told there has been no change in policy.  That is not what I am seeing on the ground.  The other question is the reciprocity deal and we are dealing with administration, so is there progress on that?

The Senator is right to say it is largely an invisible crisis because it does not get anything like the same coverage as many of other humanitarian crises.  Widespread violence from the bitter civil war which broke out in December 2013 has forced more than 4 million people to flee their homes.  Conflict and violence have caused massive displacement, with 2 million displaced within the country and over 2 million South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya.  I was in Ethiopia and Kenya a few months ago.  Sixty per cent of these refugees are children, 7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance; hunger and malnutrition are widespread and 5.7 million people are in urgent need of food assistance.  The UN's 2018 humanitarian response plan for South Sudan requires US$1.7 billion to reach 6 million people with lifesaving assistance.  Ireland has provided consistent humanitarian assistance to South Sudan with direct support of over &euro;54 million provided from 2012 to date.  In 2017 Ireland provided almost &euro;12 million and we will provide strong support again this year.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the central emergency response fund, CERF, and is the eighth largest donor.  CERF dispersed over US$15.5 million to South Sudan and will continue this.  So far this year &euro;3.5 million has been provided to our partners on the ground who are reaching the most vulnerable and those most in need of humanitarian assistance.  It is anticipated that funding of at least &euro;5 million by Ireland will be provided to South Sudan by the end of this year.<\/p><p>It is yet another humanitarian response and one we are part of.  A number of Irish NGOs are also involved there.  I am happy to be corrected, but I think a former Deputy and Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is involved in a practical way with one of the NGOs working on the ground on water access and the sinking of wells.<\/p><p> I was asked about visas for the USA.  Officials have met with officials from the US Embassy and been assured there has been no policy change.  They are happy to request further meetings to follow up on issues the Senator raises today.  I will happily try to make that happen because while the official position is the official position, if we have anecdotal evidence to suggest things are changing in practice, we must raise that.<\/p><p> On the reciprocal arrangement, as the Senator refers to it, I am slow to go into detail.  For the record, I note that we are working hard to find ways to help the undocumented Irish in the USA.  We must think about how we can be smart politically in terms of doing this and build support on Capitol Hill to facilitate a change and recognition of the Irish people who have been in the USA for a long time and who want to regularise their positions.  While we have made some progress in that area, I am very slow to raise expectations to try to create a momentum on which we cannot then follow through.  Migration is a very sensitive issue on Capitol Hill and any change is difficult to bring about.  Deputy John Deasy from Waterford has done a great deal of work in this area, particularly in talking to Democrat and Republican Congressmen.  We have had some pretty high level meetings in Washington on this issue and it was a topic of conversation for the Taoiseach and the President on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  There is a real effort to make progress but I do not want to raise expectations unduly given the legislative challenge involved in what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#K00200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the issues regarding the undocumented and on visas.  There is growing frustration among businesspeople going out on the ESTA system but who are being stopped and turned back.  As such, further engagement on that would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe referred to the hooded men.  There is a real obligation on us in that regard.  I understand that it is not an appeal and that no case has progressed further than ours successfully.  However, this is not just about the hooded men.  This is also about the way in which the ruling has been used by democracies to justify enhanced interrogation techniques which everyone considers to be torture.  As such, we need that ruling to be overturned, not just for those 14 men but for people who are in prison at the moment and could be subjected to the same methods legitimately on foot of that ruling.<\/p> <p>  The Minister dealt with the Middle East peace process.  It is cause for despair in many ways.  A lot of the problem is that the necessary ingredients are not there.  Olson said that to negotiate peace one needs four key elements, one of which is a hurting stalemate in which both sides are inflicting maximum amounts of pain on each other.  That is obviously not the case here.  Although the Palestinians are being subjected to what is in many ways dehumanising treatment, the Israelis do not seem to wish to facilitate any further negotiations in the peace process.  The other three elements are a credible facilitator, which is not there at the moment, the absence of a belligerent third party present, and leadership.  All four elements are required for a successful peace process such as we had in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, they are not in place in the Middle East.  It is also the case that there are many other competing situations which need to be dealt with, meaning it can attract only a limited amount of actual engagement.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned at lunchtime today in a speech on Brexit the unhelpfulness of discussion of a Border poll.  I agree with him 100% on that.  Discussion of a Border poll is very unhelpful in the context of Brexit, the lesson of which is that one does not have a referendum and only then tell everyone what the future looks like.  That has been the mistake in Westminster where, in fact, they still do not know what the future looks like in terms of what they want Brexit to be.  On 15 May last, Prime Minister Theresa May said she did not believe unionists would win a Border poll and Lady Sylvia Hermon has said she believed there would be a Border poll in her lifetime.  In fact, a unionist is taking the Minister's Department to court on 13 July on foot of the Government&rsquo;s policy on achieving Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#L00200","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":919,"content":"<p>We are stretching things in terms of the reporting of the Foreign Affairs Council last Monday, albeit this is a very important subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#L00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>Having been in Belfast a number of times and having met unionists, my understanding is that they are concerned.

I will continue to ask for support, in particular from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to ensure we continue to have a consistent and credible approach to the Middle East and do not do something in the short term which makes Ireland's position less relevant in terms of trying to be part of compromise solutions.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for that support to date.  Sometimes, what is popular here in the short term is not necessarily the smartest thing to do.  There may come a time for us to change our policy approach, but now is not that time.  That does not mean we should not have intensive political engagement or that we should not be absolutely critical when that is warranted.  I hope I have been speaking in a way Irish people are comfortable with in the context of the interest and concern for Palestinians in particular in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  I have made it very clear that is unhelpful for people to call for Border polls in the immediate aftermath of a referendum on abortion in Ireland.  It is adding to what is an already polarised environment in Northern Ireland on foot of Brexit and its pressures.  I have stated repeatedly and I say it again now: constitutional change on this island is not part of the Brexit discussion and it should not be.  We are looking for a practical solution to the very complicated and difficult challenges posed by Brexit.  We have to try to find a way forward which unionists and nationalists and Ireland and Britain can live with.  That is true to the December deal and the agreement in March.  We are trying to make progress on that in June so time is short.<\/p><p>According to the latest Queen's University Belfast poll, 85% of people in Northern Ireland want to be part of a shared customs union and shared single market with the European Union.  That applies to unionists and nationalists because they are looking for practical ways to protect and maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I am aware of unionist and nationalist fears, each equally genuine.  Nationalists want to avoid the re-emergence of a physical border separating them from their own country and unionists fear that new barriers may emerge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ,as they see it in an effort to resolve the Irish and island of Ireland issues linked to Brexit.  We have many challenges to overcome without introducing calls for a Border poll into the political dialogue which makes the process more difficult given the current environment.<br\/><br\/>With regard to passports, I thank the committee for its patience on this issue.  Last week, 30,000 people called the passport telephone line, which is a huge demand.  People are working night and day to deal with passports because turnaround times and so on are of the essence.  We are adding staff, taking them from other parts of the Department to have people on the call lines and increase our response capacity to emails and so on.  We have tried to be as helpful as we can for emergency cases that come through Deputies' offices but I encourage them to only forward emergency cases because our systems are under some pressure.  This is the peak time of year.  In six weeks or less, we will be off the peak and will have all the staff and resources that are there today with much less pressure on turnaround times.  The turnaround time for processing a passport application depends on the channel through which the application is submitted.  The highest proportion of applications is submitted through Passport Express, the postal channel.  Passport Express renewal applications are being processed within the target turnaround time of 15 working days.  The turnaround times for some categories of application are falling outside the target turnaround times for Passport Express first-time applicants while applications for lost or stolen passports to be replaced are taking longer than the 20-day turnaround time we had but it is generally happening in approximately 30 days.  There are practical reasons for that which I do not need to go into.<br\/><br\/>The online passport application service is a positive story.  It has a turnaround time is ten working days plus postage.  The majority of online passports are being processed within seven working days, which is ahead of target.  That is not to say there are not problems.  There has been a significant increase again this year in the number of passport applications from Northern Ireland and from Ireland generally.  That is what happens when the economy and population are growing.  More people are travelling and, therefore, need passports.  Given the Brexit pressures, we are experiencing a significant increase in passport applications from Northern Ireland and the UK.  We are at peak and our systems are under pressure.  I thank the staff because they are doing a job that is in some ways far beyond the call of duty and we are trying to deal with all the emergency cases that come through Deputies' offices as well.  I ask them to bear with us.  We are adding staff, we will get on top of this and, as the peak passes, the passport systems will be much smoother for the remainder of the year once we get through the month of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#L01100","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I echo the comments of committee members about the courtesy and help of the officials in the Minister's office and in the passport office.

Everyone in Fermanagh and Tyrone tells me they have cousins in Cavan who know and support me.  It is a great introduction but it creates difficulties for me.  We know the pressures the office is under and appreciate the assistance. <\/p><p>I live close to the Border and I am in Northern Ireland at least once or twice every week doing my ordinary constituency work in Cavan-Monaghan.  Over the past few weeks I have attended several football matches and other events where I have met people, some of whom I do not know, who are frustrated and angry that we do not have the institutions up and running in Northern Ireland.  They realise that many day-to-day issues need to be tackled, including housing, jobs, employment, rural development and regeneration.  These are the same day-to-day issues we have in our jurisdiction.  They are doubly concerned about Brexit.  I hope that the Minister and his counterparts in the British Government can encourage the two major parties in Northern Ireland to have meaningful talks and to get those institutions back up and running.  It is shameful that the institutions have not been operating since early 2017 given the many challenging day-to-day issues and the bigger picture of Brexit.  We wish the Minister well in whatever talks he has with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties there because we all want to see those institutions up and working on behalf of the people. <\/p><p>Much of the meeting was devoted to the Gaza situation and the Middle East peace process.  Recently we had Omar Barghouti of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions, the human rights movement, was here.  I asked him whether the two-state solution is still feasible and viable.  He said while it is not the opinion of his association, he thinks it is not viable.  Perhaps it is an issue we could discuss in the future.  He referred to the shrinking space for Palestinians and the intense colonisation of Palestinian land, and said life is being made impossible for Palestinians.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>We expect the territory to become unliveable in a year and a half.  The West Bank is not unliveable yet but it is becoming extremely difficult for Palestinians to sustain any life with the encroaching settlements taking over the most fertile lands and water resources.<\/blockquote> <p>That type of commentary has been echoed by other contributors at this committee.  The Minister's opening remarks and his response to colleagues indicated that concern.  We might have a discussion on that here in the future.  The Minister said at the outset that all colleagues in the EU were supportive of the two-state solution.  Is there any discussion at the Council about how feasible this will be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#M00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I would be happy to come in and spend a few hours talking about this issue, in terms of what we are trying to do.  Although I spoke a lot about it today we have not had the time to get into some of the specific measures we have been trying to promote and do.   I do not agree with those who are saying a two-state solution is no longer tenable.  If that becomes the consensus, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions about where we are going because we will not see a one-state solution where Palestinians and Israelis are living in the same country with equal rights and opportunities any time soon.  Many Israeli people would fee threatened by that.  Many Palestinians will continue to advocate for, and insist on, having their own state.  Politically, the only realistic outcome to a negotiated settlement is a two-state solution.<\/p><p>It becomes practically more and more difficult to deliver that when concrete is being poured on land that is supposed to be the basis for the negotiation of a new Palestinian state.  Some settlements, particularly near east Jerusalem, are being strategically located in a way that makes the prospect that east Jerusalem will be the capital of a future Palestinian state more and more difficult to envisage.  That is why Jerusalem has become a totemic issue for Palestinians.  In that context, the decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem is a barrier to political progress.<\/p><p> I still think it is important for us to advocate for a two-state solution.  I still believe it is possible.  That is the UN position as well as the EU position.  When I talk about unity on a number of key things across the EU, I am probably giving an overly positive description of the EU's unity on the Middle East peace process, unfortunately.  Different European countries have different red lines.  I do not believe we are sufficiently unified on the need for the EU to be far more intensively focused and involved in trying to make progress on the Middle East peace process.  Instead, there is a sense that we are waiting for the US to intervene at a time when Palestinians have made it very clear that for a series of reasons, they cannot deal with the US on their own in the context of any new initiative.  This is not easy.  I do not want to suggest naively that it is.<\/p><p> For what it is worth, I have raised the case of a Bedouin settlement that is potentially going to be demolished, with people being forcibly relocated.  The settlement in question, Khan al-Ahmar, is in the area to the east of Jerusalem.  We have asked the EU High Representative to make very strong representations when she is protesting on this issue on behalf of the EU.  It is difficult to match the aspirations we hear coming from Israel for a future peace deal with the actions that are being taken on the ground.  Settlements are constantly encroaching on the best land in the West Bank.  I refer also to the way in which Area C, which represents the majority of West Bank territory, is being managed.  The issues we face in Gaza - the humanitarian issues, the violence and the influence of Hamas and more extreme forces that are trying to capitalise on the misery of many young men and women in Gaza - are more extreme.  I know Irish people are very interested in this complicated political challenge.  I am spending a lot of time trying to ensure Ireland makes a relevant contribution on it.  That is why I am going back to the region next week.  I will happily come back here to talk about these issues in more detail if that is what members want.  If they want to bring in other expertise, we can respond to that.<\/p><p> The current circumstances in Northern Ireland are frustrating, especially considering some of the challenges that were overcome when the Good Friday Agreement was put in place.  The challenges we face today in setting up an Executive, a functioning Assembly and a devolved Government in Northern Ireland do not really compare to the challenges of 20 years ago.  All the parties in Northern Ireland say they want a devolved Government.  I do not believe the barriers to that are insurmountable.  I think the two big parties, in particular, can come together to make it happen if they wish.  It is difficult for them to do that in the context of the current uncertainty around Brexit.  They have two very different approaches to Brexit.  It is not that long ago that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in sent a joint letter on Brexit that covered issues like Border infrastructure.  Both Governments are aware of the challenges that would be associated with Brexit if there was a functioning Executive.  We would help the parties to try to overcome some of those issues.  We will continue to work.  I have a good relationship with Karen Bradley.  We are very conscious that Northern Ireland cannot continue in the current vein indefinitely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018053100002#M00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527771600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the briefing he has provided here today.

We both want to ensure that long-term financial services which are not of a fixed or definite duration can be investigated by the ombudsman under the longer time limits applying to long-term financial services.  These Government amendments are squarely aimed at ensuring that financial services which are long-term in nature but which do not specifically fix their duration can be investigated by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p> <p>  The first amendment is technical and is required by the substantive amendment.  The substantive amendment allows the ombudsman to investigate cases where the duration is not fixed but where it is reasonable for a consumer to expect its duration to be longer than the five years and one month threshold by virtue of the manner in which the services operate, the type of assets with which it is connected, or by virtue of representations made by the financial service provider.  It specifically excludes current accounts and other financial services of an indefinite duration which do not have such characteristics.  <\/p> <p>  I appreciate that this is a complex amendment, and I can see the attraction of the simplicity of the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  However, I consider that it would capture more than we agreed we would include in the expanded definition of long-term financial service.  For example, a consumer opening a current account on starting his or her first job or when he or she goes to college might reasonably expect that it will last more than five years, but we have been clear that such a product is not and should not be considered a long-term financial service.  <\/p> <p>  These Government amendments mean that whole of life cases, which are not of fixed duration by definition, can be investigated by the ombudsman subject to the time limit in section 51 of the 2017 Act.  Contrary to the common understanding that these time limits rule out misconduct that occurred prior to 2002, the current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate cases outside this limit in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, \"such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period\".  This gives the ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period to cover events that occurred earlier than 2002.  However, I should stress that there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.  There must be reasonable grounds and it must be just and equitable in all circumstances.  This means it must be just and equitable to both sides, both the consumer and the financial service provider.  <\/p> <p>  Officials from the Department were in detailed discussions with the Office of the Attorney General to see whether it was possible for the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft a constitutionally robust amendment which would allow whole of life complaints to be made to the ombudsman without time limits.  However, I would have concerns that it is arguably unfair and potentially unconstitutional to require the ombudsman to depart from these time limits regardless of whether he considers it fair or reasonable.  The key question for legislative time limits for the bringing of complaints or legal actions is whether the Oireachtas has struck a reasonable balance between the rights of the plaintiffs, the applicants, the interests of the defendants-respondents, and the public interest.   <\/p> <p>  I believe that the current Act, with the proposed Government amendments, strikes a reasonable balance.  For these reasons I am pressing the Government amendments and cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>We welcome this group of amendments, which take aim at the same points, the inclusion of certain groups that, by the spirit of the legislation, should have redress to the Financial Services Ombudsman but which the ombudsman has ruled currently do not qualify.  I am of the view that it is possible and arguable that the findings of the ombudsman could be challenged, but the best thing to do is to clear up any uncertainty by making it crystal clear and precise that they do indeed qualify.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, wrote to the Minister in October about this issue.  The Minister responded positively and has acted with the amendments tabled today.  The group in question are members of one member schemes which fell foul of the definition of long-term financial service.  The issue was the definition of the word \"fixed\".  Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment sought to remedy this problem by introducing a new definition of a financial service in which the consumer could reasonably expect the service to last more than five years and one month, the point being that the definition of \"fixed\" was too restrictive.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister of State has outlined in his comments, his amendments very much tackle the same issue, and we are satisfied that they resolve it.  We will consequently support those amendments and will withdraw our own.<\/p> <p>  The next challenge, as we see it, is amendment No. 5, which I believe has been ruled out of order.  We should all be of one mind on the issue it raises; it allows access to the Financial Services Ombudsman for those people who bought whole of life insurance products and other whole of life products before 2002.  There are some concerning issues being brought to the attention of Deputies about these cases.  The interpretation of the 2002 Act by the ombudsman means that these people are being barred from the process.  Amendment No. 5, which has been disallowed, was tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty, and would have made an attempt to get to the heart of this issue.  At the core of the legislation recently passed was a new rule that a consumer complaint within three years of being aware of an issue, or that they could reasonably be considered to have become aware of it, would allow a person access to the Financial Services Ombudsman process.  This replaced the old six year blanket rule.  Many people have benefited from that change, but in the case of very long-term products backstop has become a problem.  We can make no judgment of the merits of the cases or whether the complainants have a good case or otherwise, but the point is that they deserve access to the process.  This is something that Deputy Pearse Doherty and my party intend to return to on Report Stage.  Given that the amendment was ruled out of order, I would like the Minister of State to commit to dealing with this issue and will consider it at that stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":980,"content":"<p>We have carried out a good deal of analysis on this matter.  We are satisfied that the legislation that was passed last year is sufficient.  I will read the note and we can then discuss it through the Chair.  The current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate complaints about long-term financial services that occurred before 2002 in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, \"such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period\".<\/p><p>This gives the Ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period.  I would stress there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.

It is a matter for the Ombudsman to make this decision and the Ombudsman is independent.  The follow-on from that is important because it is something on which we are all like-minded.  We want the Ombudsman to have the authority to deal with these matters.  The Ombudsman has the authority.  It is a matter for his discretion whether to use that authority.<\/p><p> I have a note that I want to put on the record.  The Ombudsman will always consider whether the exercise of this discretion is appropriate when a long-term financial service is not being investigated due to time limits.  The exercise of this discretion does not have to be requested by the complainant.  I understand from the conversation between Department officials and the Ombudsman that there were only a small number of cases.  I did not get the actual number of cases or whether the requester has requested him to exercise his discretion.  To date, the Ombudsman has not exercised this discretion.<\/p><p> We are satisfied that the legislation is solid and that it is allowable for the Ombudsman to investigate but, as of now, he has not sanctioned any of those requests that have come to him.  I do not have the actual number to go beyond the 2002 period.  We have done our bit.  The members, as Members of the Oireachtas, have done their bit in regard to the legislation.  We are satisfied it is sufficiently strong.  It then moves to the Ombudsman for him to exercise his discretion to facilitate an investigation to a pre-2002 long-term financial services product.<\/p><p> As Deputy Michael McGrath has just arrived, I will read the note again.  Section 51 of the 2007 Act, the Act that we all put a good chunk of time into dealing with last year to get over the line, provides for a departure from a rigid six-year rule because the complainant has three years from the date he or she became aware or ought to have become aware of the cause of action to make a complaint.  While there is a general time limit of 2002, in regard to the conduct being complained of there is a provision for the possibility of a longer period extending to before 2002 where the Ombudsman decides it would be reasonable to allow a longer period and would be just and equitable in the circumstances.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman, therefore, to facilitate an investigation prior to the 2002 time schedule that is part of section 51 of last year's Act.  It is a matter for the discretion of the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.

There are people who have what are essentially legitimate complaints about products that predate 2002 that have not been able to proceed because of the decisions of the Ombudsman.  At the very least, that requires a further examination.  If these people have complaints, whatever their merits , the spirit of which come within the meaning of the change in the six-year rules, there is clearly a problem in that regard.

On a separate occasion I will ask the committee to write to the Ombudsman to look for data on the number of cases that have come before him that are in this category where the alleged mis-selling, for example, would have occurred prior to 2002 and where he has opted not to use the discretion to avail of the powers this Oireachtas gave to him under the Act to have a look-back.  In that context, we should be looking for the information on the number of those cases, his reasons and his interpretation of the legislation on which we all worked hard to secure its passage.<\/p> <p>  We spoke on Second Stage about the issue of whole-of-life policies, which are very important.  There are many people who have been very badly burned, so to speak, and I know the Minister of State is also aware of individual cases.  I have sat down with many of those people and I am convinced that the terms and conditions of those products were not fully explained.  There is certainly a case to be made in some instances that there was mis-selling, therefore, it would be very disappointing if the Ombudsman decided not to use the powers the Oireachtas gave him.  It comes down to the interpretation of the reasonable grounds to extend the look-back prior to 2002.  That is something we need to tease out further.  We need to keep an open mind on this issue between now and Report Stage but it is very important that the committee would seek that clarification prior to Report Stage and that we reserve the right to introduce more explicit amendments at that stage to remove any element of doubt and make this absolutely clear.  Obviously, they need to be constitutional but if we need to further strengthen the option the Ombudsman has to look back prior to 2001, I and my party would be in favour of that.  However, we need an explanation from the Ombudsman first and if we can get that prior to Report Stage, that would be important because there are many long-term products.  It is not just whole-of-life products.  Those are important but there are many other long-term financial products, and those are the very products we designed that amendment for to enable them to be dealt with.  I know mis-selling is a very difficult case to prove if we are looking back over 15 or 20 years in terms of who said what.  The documentation may be limited.  It is a very difficult case to prove but I am disappointed to hear that the Ombudsman has had that power for a period of months and has chosen not to exercise it.

I am joined today by officials from the Department; Mr. Paul Lemass, Mr. Diarmuid O'Leary, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue and Ms &Aacute;inle N&iacute; Bhriain.<\/p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government sets out a number of requirements relating to local government reform.  In particular, the programme envisages the submission of a report to the Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  Today's engagement forms part of that consultative process. <br\/><br\/>To date, the Department has published two papers on this topic.  The papers presented today for consideration by the committee address municipal governance, including questions on local electoral areas and town councils, and local authority boundaries where urban development crosses local authority boundaries. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The municipal governance paper sets out a range of proposals to strengthen the current municipal district system within local authorities and to address identified shortcomings, rather than reestablish town councils.  The paper sets out a strong rationale for this approach, not least the fact that local authority members, represented by the Association of Irish Local Government, AIL, and Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, have not called for restoration of town councils.  The AILG would prefer stronger powers for municipal district members, greater focus on towns and a reduction in the territorial size of excessively large local electoral areas, LEAs, which the review of local electoral areas that is almost complete will address.  The proposals in the municipal governance paper are based mainly on these objectives. <br\/><br\/>Some of the specific proposals in this document include measures to reduce the excessive size of many LEAs and ensure that all areas are as coherent and reflective of local identity as possible,  including designation of distinct town-based local electors areas for larger urban centres with a population of 15,000 people or more.  The work of the local electoral area boundary committees is addressing this issue and will be completed in the middle of June.<br\/><br\/>The document proposes measures to achieve greater town focus in local government arrangements, especially in larger urban centres where the municipal districts will be retitled town districts or borough districts, with the name of the relevant town included in the title in all such cases, for example, Wexford borough district.  Local authorities will also be given a right to petition the Minister to rename a district.<br\/><br\/>The document also proposes to strengthen the role and capacity of the elected members at municipal district level, particularly in budgetary and local development matters, to promote the economic and social development of towns as well as addressing any inconsistencies in the way the current arrangements are being operated.  It is fair to say, from one local authority to another, that there are inconsistencies with the way the municipal district system is being operated.  Municipal district members have significant powers but the application of these powers seems to differ throughout the country. <br\/><br\/>The financial capacity of elected members at municipal district level has been highlighted as being of particular importance.  Proposals to address this matter includes the following: restoring earmarked roads funding for larger towns; strengthening the role of municipal district members in the local authority budget process, including aspects such as the general municipal allocation, the schedule of municipal district works, the draft budgetary plan and other relevant budgetary proposals and reports; and bringing greater clarity and focus to the municipal district members' decision-making authority over a range of discretionary funding.  There will be an examination of the apparent gap in urban renewal or development funding for some important towns.  The role of district members in the local authority budget process will also be strengthened.  Funding under Project Ireland 2040, through the regeneration and development fund, will be important in this context. <br\/><br\/>The second paper is entitled, Local Authority boundaries.  In this paper, enhanced statutory provisions are proposed to address the issue of urban development crossing county boundaries.  In such instances, the paper proposes new statutory joint structures rather than an alteration of county boundaries or a reliance on existing provisions for voluntary co-operation.  These joint structures will focus particularly on the forward planning of the areas in question, and will not duplicate the role of other agencies, for example, those that specifically deal with tourism, inward investment and economic development.  Joint structures would have responsibility for the development and planning of the entire area of a town or city that crosses a county boundary such as Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford, including responsibility for certain key strategic matters beyond the existing standard functions of local authorities, especially in respect of spatial and economic planning and development.  These structures would also have responsibility for transportation strategy, forward planning and land use designation, retail strategy, and any other such matters as both local authorities may agree.  Such structures would not, however, have responsibility for delivering existing local authority functions, save in such circumstances as agreed by the relevant authorities.  It is also proposed that provision for statutory joint structures would be accompanied by a clear legislative guarantee for the permanent integrity of local county identity and traditional allegiance through legislative provision to copperfasten the status of the cities and counties as territorial units.  It will no longer be possible to alter a boundary between two local authorities without the consent of both authorities and the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>I will shortly bring papers to Government on local authority structures and governance.  One paper will set out for further consideration a range of proposals on local authority governance, and leadership and administration, which are referenced for consideration in the Programme for Partnership Government.  These proposals will address the tenure and role of mayors and chairs, ancillary governance structures and processes, and other measures to enhance council effectiveness.<br\/><br\/>A further paper will specifically deal with legislation on the extension of the boundary of Cork city and consideration of the report of the Galway expert advisory group.In the case of Galway, the expert oversight group has endorsed previous recommendations for amalgamation of Galway city and county councils, to take effect not later than 2021.  The oversight group recommends that the councils, as currently constituted, should continue for the purposes of the 2019 local elections.<br\/><br\/>Other specific measures recommended by the oversight group includes measures to strengthen municipal districts in general and increased resourcing to enable them to realise their full potential.  This recommendation dovetails with the recommendations put forward in the municipal governance paper.  The group also recommended additional measures to address the deficiencies in human resources and financial resources prior to the merger process. <br\/><br\/>In December 2017, the Government decided to proceed with the extension of the Cork City boundary, as recommended by the advisory group, and agreed a revised boundary delineation recommended in the implementation oversight group's report in December 2017.  The general scheme of a Bill to provide for the Cork boundary alteration, and arrangements related to its implementation, is being submitted to Government.  The scheme will address the need for detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation process, and the role of the respective local authorities and the implementation oversight group.  The legislation will also address the timing of the transition from both a financial and operational perspective<b>. <\/b><br\/><br\/>Two local electoral area boundary committees were established on 13 December 2017 to review, and make recommendations on, local electoral areas in advance of the 2019 local elections.  The policy objectives of the review are to reduce the size of territorially large LEAs, and to designate urban-focused LEAs around the larger towns to enhance good local government.  In doing so, the committees will have regard to the results of census 2016.  The two committees have received more than 370 submissions so far and submissions are still being received in respect of Galway city and county.  The committees are due to complete their reports by 13 June 2018. <br\/><br\/>In the coming weeks, further policy papers will be submitted to Government and, thereafter, proceed to this committee for its consideration.  These papers will examine in detail other local government issues, including those identified in the programme for Government, namely, local authority functions, particularly through the devolution of centrally held functions and powers, leadership, including directly elected mayors for cities, and governance of our cities in a manner that will facilitate their planned and sustainable future development, in line with the objectives of the national planning framework.<br\/><br\/>I do not wish to pre-empt these policy reports or our future discussion on the matters therein.  However, I anticipate that the report on political leadership will consider the issue of full-time, full-term mayors or cathaoirligh.  It will also examine the possibility of the direct election of mayors for Ireland's cities.  In doing so, it will consider the division of executive and reserved functions in local authorities, and examine alternatives.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to returning to this forum in the near future to discuss these papers and the upcoming legislation in more detail.  I am confident that the measures outlined, combined with those in development, will significantly enhance the capacity of local government to deliver effective, efficient and quality services to all citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#B00300","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement and call Deputy O'Dowd to comment first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#C00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for allowing me to comment first because I must leave shortly to attend another event.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State to the meeting.

My point is that the town of Drogheda, as designated by the Central Statistics Office, had a population of more than 40,000 when the last census was taken.  Even though there are more people in the town of Drogheda than there are in counties Longford and Leitrim, there is no local government structure in the town.  Counties Leitrim and Longford have a full administrative structure, including county managers, senior engineers and planning authorities.  We do not have that in Drogheda.  We are part of a county that has a rapidly growing population as a consequence of the Government's decision to designate towns like Drogheda and Dundalk as regional growth centres.  I believe they are different from the municipal districts and extended municipal districts that are designated in the Minister of State's papers.  There are huge issues attaching to local control and decision-making in Drogheda.  I will not talk about Dundalk because I do not live there.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister of State to take it from today's discussion that there is a need to review the position in respect of towns with populations in excess of 40,000.  When Galway was made a city, there were 37,000 souls living in it.  Even though Drogheda now exceeds that number, it is proposed that it will merely have a municipal district council.  The increased powers that the Minister of State intends to give to such councils are not good enough for the people of Drogheda.  The current proposal is not acceptable.  The problem is that between 4,000 and 5,000 people who live in east Meath were included in the town of Drogheda for the purposes of the census.  Given that there is extant planning permission for over 5,000 homes to the north of Drogheda, the population of Drogheda will exceed 50,000, which is the level needed to be designated as a city, in the coming years.  An urban area becomes a city when its population reaches 50,000.  I understand from the CSO that the development in the County Louth part of the Drogheda area that will happen over the coming five or six years will bring the population of Drogheda to 50,000 by 2023.  Drogheda will be a city, in effect, at that stage.<\/p><p> I appreciate that the Minister of State and I have discussed this issue previously.  I do not expect him to give me a decision today.  Perhaps discussions between elected members and departmental officials could be opened on foot of this meeting to prepare for Drogheda to acquire city status.  I refer to the special local government reforms that will need to take place separately from the joined-up Meath-Louth proposal that currently exists.  I do not think that will deal with the problem.  I welcome the new powers being proposed by the Minister of State to strengthen local government.  A town that is going to be a city within ten years and has been designated by the Government as a regional centre must have the capacity to govern itself and be accountable to itself.  This involves having a manager and an engineer resident in the town.  They need to be accountable and responsible to the local council.  The municipal council does not hold the officials to account, and that is what is missing in all of this.  I do not mean any disrespect to anybody when I say that.  The problem is that there are no officials with direct responsibility for the area.  I do not say that as a criticism of the manager, who is excellent in every way.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and I apologise for having to leave.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to the important points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#C00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I suppose I have sympathy for the points the Deputy is trying to make.

The Deputy has spoken about the projected increase in the population of Drogheda over the coming years.  This is a good example of how the municipal district structure functions better in some local authority areas than in others.  In many local authorities, there are designated officials who act as engineers, in effect, for certain towns.  They might have wider responsibilities within the local authority, but they are held to account at municipal district level.  Equally, in some local authorities directors of service are appointed and given responsibility for specific municipal districts.  In effect, they act within that district with some of the responsibilities of a local authority manager or chief executive.  It varies widely across the country.  I agree with the Deputy's point that a growing town, which is designated under the national planning framework should receive special resources to enable it to develop properly.  I will talk to my colleagues in the Department about towns that are projected to grow in population to more than 50,000 over the 20 years of the planning framework.

I will speak to my colleagues about that.  We have included a new provision that will allow a joint structure to be put in place in respect of any town with a population of more than 15,000 that crosses a county boundary.  I understand the Deputy's argument that this will not be sufficient for Drogheda.  I envisage that this whole new structure will play a significant role in the proper development of the cities and towns across the country that cross county boundaries.  There are some examples of good co-operation, including Carlow town.  Laois County Council and Carlow County Council have co-operated for years.  The local authority in Carlow provides many local services in the Graiguecullen part of County Laois that comes right into Carlow town.  Sadly, that has not been the case in most other places across the country.  These new structures are specifically designed to ensure neighbouring local authorities are forced, in effect, to co-operate with one another on planning, land use, transportation and the designation of where development will happen in the future.  Such matters comprise just a part of a town's responsibilities.  I will talk to my colleagues about whether additional resources can be given under the national planning framework to towns that will soon exceed 50,000 in population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#D00800","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>While I welcome the Minister of State's response, it is clear that it does not go far enough.

I thank him.  I do not doubt his commitment.  We have soldiered together.  I think we were both elected to local authorities in 1999.  I have known about the Minister of State's commitment to and track record in local government for a long time.<\/p> <p>  I have read comprehensively the local authority boundaries paper that has been circulated to the joint committee by the Minister of State.  It deals with municipal governance districts, towns and local electoral areas.  Although there is a lot of repetition in it, many good points are made in it too.  They seem to merge into each other and overlap.  That is the nature of local government.  The paper features an outpouring of ambition and ideas, but it is clear that not everything in it is going to happen.  I found it hard to decipher the difference between what people fed into the consultation process - I refer to the wishes of people, including elected councillors and policy makers in local government - and the recommendations of the Minister of State.  I presume this is a process of engagement.<\/p> <p>  I think I know what the Minister of State is about.  He has an opportunity now to correct me if I am wrong.  The first thing I took from the paper was a suggestion that the Local Authorities Members Association and, in effect, the Association of Local Government in Ireland are not banging down the door for the re-establishment of town councils.  The Minister of State mentioned this issue in his address to the committee this morning and, again, he can correct me if I am wrong.  As the suggestion in the paper is totally inconsistent with what I am hearing from councillors, I have to ask whether there is a deficit between them and their representative bodies.  I know they are tuning in to this meeting.  I am consciously calling on them to clear this matter up.<\/p><p>Clearly, they are representing these councils so they need to square that themselves.  It is not a matter for us.  We need to know from them if it is the view of their memberships that they are opposed to the re-establishment of town councils or are we saying, in a more fine-tuned and nuanced way, to bed down the current system - I can see Mr. Lemass smiling at me - and let us look at it again after the full five year roll-out?  I would be inclined to agree with that.  I am happy to say this on the record.  We need to be clear about that because it is an important point.<\/p><p> The Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, are very formal organised representative bodies that do a good job in representing councillors.  How can we link them into the consultation process around the vision the Minister of State has for local government?  It is important to have an ongoing consultation process.  These are only two aspects of the bigger picture being planned by the Minister of State but we need to engage with those bodies early in the consultation.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the timeline as he sees it.  We are running into the local elections in June 2019, unless the Minister of State is going to tell us something different.  I take it the date is the statutory deadline.  We are, therefore, on for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#D01000","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>It will be May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#E00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>It will be May.  Perhaps the Minister of State could confirm this in his response.  How does the Minister of State envisage the legislative process?  Before I move on to more of the focus points, how does the Minister of State see this committee involved in it?  I am delighted he is here today to update us on the brief, but what role does he see for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government?  I am aware that local government and electoral reform come under the remit of the Minister of State, which is an important relationship.  In the coming months, will he consider setting out a programme for engagement with us?  It has to be a meaningful engagement for us and for the Minister of State.  Will he please elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  I welcome very much the Minister of State's comment that it will no longer be possible to alter a boundary between two local authorities without the consent of both authorities and, indeed, of the Oireachtas.  This is a positive move because far too often in places such as Cork and Galway we have seen the heavy hand of the Custom House.  I am not saying this is so, but there is a perception that the boys in the Custom House have decided to chop us all up.  It is worth reiterating.  It is a strong point that has come from the Minister of State's comments today.  Will the Minister of State please confirm if 30 June 2018 is still the target date for the roll out of the boundaries?  People are waiting and they want to know so they can make arrangements and consolidate their positions.  This is understandable for politicians.<\/p> <p>  In his statement the Minister of State referred to A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Clearly in the programme for Government there are a number of key objectives, including the Minister of State taking over this area, in which he will focus on some key deliverables.  Will he speak about the issue of directly-elected mayors and cities?  How will this happen, or not happen?  Will there be plebiscites?  Are we going to engage with people on the matter?  I am against the idea of directly elected mayors.  I do not necessarily see it as a good thing.  There are a whole range of people who could stand who might have no experience or interest in local government and who could become popularity contestants for mayor.  While I would not say it was good, I have a fairly regular and positive relationship with the council managers and the chief executives and I get the distinct impression from them that they are against the idea also.  There is a problem with that.  We need to sit down with the chief executives and councils and see what is best for us.  It should not be the case that just because other places in the EU have directly elected mayors then we should have them too.  Would it work here?  The Irish local government system is unique in Europe.  The system here is very different in its connectivity.  I would caution against the idea of directly elected mayors.  If the Minister of State decides to proceed with the idea, it would be important to look at the issue of plebiscites.  How would the consultation happen?  We had an outcry over the four local authorities in Dublin some years ago.<\/p> <p>  On the devolution of new powers to local authorities, it is all great talk.  Before I came here, there was much talk about the great things to be done, such as devolving the powers, but we have become even more centralised.  One of the greatest tasks and challenges for the Minister of State is to work on how we can devolve more powers from central government to local government.  With that power, however, comes responsibility.  Will the Minister of State talk to us about that?  I fully agree with his comments on reducing the size of electoral areas.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude on a matter on which I have battled for a long time.  The Department strategy says that there will be a review, involving consultation with the AILG and LAMA, of the supports provided to councillors to enable them to do their important work.  The Minister of State knows where I am going with this; I want to talk about remuneration.  For those who do not know, directly elected sitting county and city councillors receive &euro;16,500 per year for what is effectively a seven day working week.  A councillor is part parish priest, part social worker, part counsellor and a whole lot of other things besides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#E00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>And an engineer and a planner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#E00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>And everything else.

We must stop playing games here.  These elected local authority members are entitled to know.  A promise was given to them that there would be a review of their pay, remuneration and allowances.

It is not only devolution of powers but it is the balance that lies between the Executive and the council at local level.  We are looking at establishing a new process or formula as to how we should consider functions that should be devolved to local government.  In other words, if a service that is provided by a State agency or authority or a Department can be delivered as, or more, efficiently or cost effectively by the local authority, then that is the mechanism that would apply.  A general standard would have to reached in order for a function to be devolved to local government.  The functions local authorities have is one of the things that comes up for discussion around the time of local elections, in particular.  However, I would point out that in some of the discussions with some of the representative groups of councillors, they were unable to provide me with any additional functions that local authority members should have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#F00900","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>Did the Minister of State ask them to go away and consider this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#F01000","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Yes, and I have not spoken with them since.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#F01100","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>Have they not come back to him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#F01200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>I am open to consideration, but there has to be some sort of a mechanism whereby, rather than having the Minister looking at each individual issue as it arises, if there is a process that can look at a function that can be delivered more or as efficiently at local level, then that should apply.

However, we are missing that special focus.  Directors of services are dealing with macro issues.  The Minister of State is aware of this as a long-serving public representative.  The directors of services may be the <i>de facto<\/i>managers, although they are not called that any more, for a large urban area.  The director of services is specifically dealing with a brief.  There will be directors of services for housing and directors of services for finance and that will be their day-to-day job.  They are not specifically thinking about the development of an urban centre.  For them, it is one or two meetings a month that they have to attend.  What is missing is the role, for example, at town clerk level, which would allow that special focus to happen at an administrative level.  Many councillors are saying that they do not have that synergy between themselves and the executive because of the fact the town clerk level has been eroded out of the system.  While directors of services are exemplary and dedicated public officials and deal with macro issues - for example, the development of a key piece of infrastructure such as a road or a social amenity - that is the input they have.  However, we are missing this other level.<\/p><p>In terms of acknowledging the deficiency, as the paper does, much of its focus is on the reasons for getting rid of town councils, and stating that there were compelling reasons for doing this, rather than on dealing with where we are in terms of the over-centralisation of powers as regards local government, which the Minister of State mentioned.  The paper sets out the compelling reasons for dispensing with town councils, including limited powers and limited resources, but on that basis, one would get rid of county councils.<\/p><p>Another reason given was the exclusion of more than 200,00 residents of town suburbs.  This could be resolved by extending boundaries.  We did this in Navan.  We acknowledged that in the boom period a large number of people were not represented by the town council structure.  We went to the then Minister with responsibility for local government, John Gormley, and there was an extension of the boundaries so that the administrative powers of the town reflected the real population base of the town.  As I said, acknowledging a deficiency and then applying the solution of just getting rid of something was the wrong move.  A solution could have been found in respect of this.<\/p><p>The paper states that expanding boundaries would have negatively impacted on county councils.  Extending the boundary did not impact negatively on my county council.  If anything, it gave people who lived in the suburbs of the town a real sense of engagement with their municipal town hall because they knew where to go.  It addressed many of the problems that existed.<\/p><p> Budgets are a significant issue.  Without financial autonomy, councils cannot address the issues that people want to see addressed and are nothing more than glorified talking shops, as many local councillors will agree.  Let us leave politics aside, municipal areas such as Carlow, Navan and Cork need financial autonomy to address, in a real and substantive way, issues such as roads, housing and social amenities.  Social amenities are a major issue.  We have created new population areas and people in them are looking to their councillors to provide the social amenities needed.<\/p><p> If the budgets only tinker with the issue and financial autonomy is retained at county council level, there will be no impact.  Will the retention of income from local property tax, LPT, within an administrative area rather than at county level be addressed?  The Taoiseach said he was open to looking at that at a county level.  I would bring it down even further to the town level.  On the retention of funds raised within a major urban space, parking charges in a large town can raise a couple of million euro which could be used for the enhancement of the local area.  When I raised this issue previously, Mr. Lemass asked if people coming into a town from the country are not entitled to see parking income being spent elsewhere in the county.  On that logic, the people of Meath who come into the centre of Dublin to shop should receive income from Dublin City Council to be spent in Navan.  That argument does not make any sense.<\/p><p> On the setting of rates, the Minister of State and I both came through the local government system.  Different towns are under different pressures in different parts of counties.  Having financial autonomy in areas such as rates would allow major urban areas to deal with existing circumstances.  <\/p><p> The paper refers to the benefit of a single financial authority helping to improve the management of debts.  I saw in my own case a county council that was mired in debt while the town council administrative area was running a surplus.  The financial model was sound as it allowed the town council, an autonomous body that was not mired in debt, to go to the banks and arrange finance and loans to develop social amenities such as theatres and parks.  The case made in the paper can be unpicked when we consider examples such as the one I described.<\/p><p> I will address the issue of powers.  The paper addresses the shortcomings and weaknesses in the former town council arrangements.  It states they made only a marginal input into the overall local government system of governance, service provision and representation.  That is a shocking statement.  During my 17 years as a councillor, I worked on town plans and county council plans.  I saw many positive things happen because of good town development plans.  It was good governance and we were able to achieve far greater things.  If, by virtue of the national plans the Government is introducing, we are working towards greater urbanisation, we should have a system of government that reflects this objective.  We need to strengthen the local government system to give these large urban areas the proper local governance they deserve.  People living in major towns - Deputy O'Dowd referred to Drogheda - will engage first and foremost in their local area.  <\/p><p> Rows break out every month at the plenary meetings of county councils about where budgets are being spent.  That is because major urban centres have not been allowed autonomous budgets.  This is becoming a major issue and urban areas are under pressure as a result.  Engagement with the Local Authority Members' Association, LAMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, has been suggested.  There is a disconnect somewhere.  I met representatives of the AILG several times this year, including last week in Buswells Hotel and in this House, and I was told the paper was a misrepresentation of the AILG's views.  The association indicated it was prepared to see if things bedded down over a five year period.  Perhaps the Minister of State was given a different message.  I am highlighting what was said to me.  The AILG referred to the workload that would arise if a cohort of councillors was removed.  Councillors may be telling the Minister of State there is no problem and the system does not need to be changed.  However, the councillors who were removed as a result of the abolition of town councils cannot say anything because they are no longer in place.<\/p><p>  It is most important to engage with the residents of these areas, for example, people who cannot see an improvement in their estate or town because of the redistribution of funding as a result of the new system.  The key point is that councillors with their arses on seats in county councils will be always be happy.  It is those who no longer have a seat that will give out.  We should stand up for the people living in the towns where councils were abolished.  If all parties, including the AILG, were in the same room when this issue was being discussed, we could have an honest debate about proper local governance in the country.<\/p><p> The Minister of State is 100% right on the issue of mayors.  There is no point providing for the direct election of mayors - and I am speaking from one politician to another - if we do not give them proper powers.  On the question of whether directly elected mayors should have executive powers at the same level as county managers and chief executives, mayors in other parts of Europe operate like a mini-Taoiseach.  They appoint a mini-cabinet and councillors have portfolios such as responsibility for social amenities, housing, etc.  We could do much more in local governance.  Senator Boyhan is right about empowering councillors and giving them real responsibility.  If they mess up, local people will know who messed up or made a hames of the delivery of services in the town in question.  The same cannot be said of an official because no one ever sees officials.  Let us roll the dice, empower councillors and give them the power to deliver services.  If they make a mess of delivering services and amenities for their towns, they will be held accountable and lose office at the next election.  Councillors can blame officials when things go wrong and take the praise when things go right.  It works both ways and we should look at that also.<\/p><p> I will finish shortly.  I am passionate about this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#F01700","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>The Deputy has spoken for ten minutes already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#G00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>This is just like the report of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#G00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>On boundaries, I am glad it will no longer be possible to alter a boundary between two local authorities without the consent of both.

Since then, an attempt has been made to secure city status for the town which would encompass even more areas of County Meath.  The proposal is not feasible.  This issue must be addressed and I am glad the report makes proposals in this area.  I agree with Senator Boyhan that the independent commission must report promptly.<\/p> <p>  On budgets, the report focuses too much on the deficiencies the authors believe were in the old town council system without acknowledging the major benefits of town councils, including the delivery of good governance.

The situation that existed in Navan and in many towns across the country, where some people got two ballot papers and others only got one, is democratically unsustainable.  I have no great difficulty with the origins of our Victorian system of town governance.  I do not see a reason that we cannot integrate town governance into the broader local authority.  That will mean additional funds and staff.  Many Oireachtas Members have spoken to me about the issue that Deputies O'Dowd and Cassells have raised about having that structure in the municipal district of a town.<\/p><p> I emphasise that the terms of reference of the boundary review that is about to be completed specifically focussed on towns of 15,000 and upwards.  Those towns will have their own municipal district.  I have visited some local authorities where staff resources have been diverted to municipal districts, but I accept it is hit and miss throughout the county.  As part of the strengthening process, we should consider increasing the staffing of municipal districts.  Deputy Cassells referred to the role of the town clerk.  Significant investment in staff would not be required, but it would be a good idea to have personnel to bring about a little local activity, action and management.<\/p><p> Deputy Cassells referred to the AILG and LAMA and the differences between what he was told and what I was told.  It could not have been made clearer to me in any meetings I have had with both organisations that they oppose the reintroduction of town councils and support the beefing up of municipal districts.  It was not said in a way that sent out a mixed message.  The officials who are present today were with me at those meetings and it was made clear.<\/p><p> I refer to the relationship between the county council structure and the larger towns that used to have town councils.  Part of the argument the Deputy made about Meath County Council being mired in debt whereas the town ran a surplus is a good example of why the integration of the financial resources was the correct action to take.  The cost of delivering services in large rural areas, in particular, is much greater that it will ever be in a town with a dense population.  We have 31 local authorities and that will be reduced by one in the next six to seven years.

There was severe opposition to the abolition of Kilkenny Borough Council which was there for hundreds of years.  It should not have been abolished and it should have been integrated properly within the county council structure and the review that is under way will, hopefully, achieve that.  I hope we will do the same for Navan, ensure it has its own municipal district and have a beefed-up staff  will be properly integrated into a unitary local government structure throughout the country, rather than returning to the old system where in certain towns with a town council, if someone received 30 or 40 votes, he or she would become a town councillor.  I acknowledge town councils could have been abolished and others could have been kept but the principle of having one system of local government rather than trying a mishmash of two, which was what existed, was behind the change.  We should make the changes necessary to ensure the reforms work well in practice.<\/p> <p>  Regarding financial autonomy, I do not want to go into too much detail on the variations in rates because a commercial rates Bill will be before the committee in a number of weeks, which will give autonomy to municipal districts to retain rates within the district if they choose to vary commercial rates and vacancy refunds as well.  We are in strong discussions with several different Departments about the allocations they are making to local authorities, including the Department of Rural and Community Development, which provides up to &euro;40 million under two schemes.  The villages and towns selected for those schemes should be decided by the municipal district members.  There is no reason for it to go to the plenary session of the council.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is inclined to agree with us.  We should be in a position to make that change.  The funding provided by central Government to the local authorities could not, and should not, be devolved to the municipal district.  In advance of the formation of the next municipal districts in May 2019, we want to ensure that the allocation that is given centrally to local authorities can be broken down much further to municipal districts.  The rows about funding at the plenary session mentioned by the Deputy happen in many councils.  Those decisions should be made at municipal district level.  The plenary session should be about the wider policy issues for the entire local authority.  That was envisaged in the legislation originally and some local authorities keep those funding questions for municipal district level.  There needs to be standardisation across the board as to how funding matters are dealt with and how and what issues the plenary session of the county council should deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#H00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting.

It has never ceased to amaze me since I first became a Senator 16 years ago that when investment in the regions was raised, Senators from the west would rise one after the other and support each other and their region and party political colours went out the window whereas that lack of cohesiveness in the south east was always apparent because of the rivalry between different counties.  That is grand for the sporting field but it is not a sustainable way to develop the region, an economy or a society.  Equally, when one considers the location of our region, it is within easy reach of Cork and Dublin and is accessible via three motorways, two rail lines, and three ports, two of which are of international scale.  I was always puzzled as to why we had the lowest average disposable household incomes in the country and the lowest third level attendance rates, even at the height of the Celtic tiger.  There was a brain drain  The development of a university in our region has been an ongoing process, but at least the legislative framework is in place now and the two colleges in Carlow and Waterford are working together to bid for university status.  Many young people leave our region and do not come back and the reason average household incomes are lower in our region than anywhere else is those who go on to third and fourth level education and earn higher incomes do not tend to return to the region.  The region is also highly dependent on agriculture and tourism, sectors that do not tend to generate the highest incomes.<\/p><p>That is why I believe the development of the university which is an agonisingly slow process but which is starting to happen is so important.  <\/p><p> On the issue of the boundary, decisions were made before my time that the report outlining the potential for co-operation between the authorities in Waterford and Kilkenny was not going to be implemented.  The decision I have made is that we have to force co-operation between the authorities in Waterford and Kilkenny and also between other neighbouring authorities across the country.  When I was a member of a local authority almost 20 years ago, meetings did not take place.  I live 200 yards from the boundary between Waterford and Kilkenny and there were never discussions on matters of mutual interest and concern.  Such meetings started to take place for the first time in the last couple of years.  The structure about which we are talking will put that process on a statutory footing.  <\/p><p> Senator Grace O'Sullivan spoke about the north quays.  It is a landmark development for the region.  In the future, when any Government agency, Department or organisation is looking at Waterford in the context of transportation or development, this structure will have the authority to make the decisions on zoning designation, land use and transportation and the economic marketing of areas.  Waterford is a good example.  The Senator's family are based in Tramore which is not considered under the national planning framework to be part of Waterford city, yet most of the people living there work in the city.  I am not saying we should develop the space between Tramore and Waterford city into a sprawl, but one cannot look at Waterford city without looking at Tramore or the Port of Waterford which is in Slieverue, County Kilkenny.  The new structure will be able to look at the entire area.  On the boundary issue, it was never a runner because of the sense of county identity in Ireland which would not allow such a change to happen.  However, that does not preclude us from looking at new ways of developing important regional hubs.  Waterford is the capital of the south east and suffered during the recessionary years.  Things are now beginning to improve in Waterford city, with the recent development of the Apple Market and the huge potential of the north quays.  The new structure has not been thrashed out, but it will be part of the local government Bill which is due to be brought before the Government in the next few weeks and the Oireachtas by the summer.  We will have an opportunity to have a further discussion on how it will actually operate in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#H00600","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I want to discuss the issues of council powers and directly elected mayors.  <\/p> <p>  Local authorities have seen their powers diminish year after year in recent times.  For 12 years I was a member of a local authority - Cork City Council - and witnessed that diminishment of powers.  For example, bin collection services were run by councils, but they were then privatised across the country.  Alongside the privatisation of bin collection services we saw the introduction of bin charges.  That privatisation has come at a high cost to taxpayers.  It is a hidden cost - the cost of illegal dumping.  I am totally opposed to illegal dumping, but one does not need to be a rocket scientist to work out that if a service is privatised and charges are introduced which tend to rise over a period of time, there will be illegal dumping and that it will increase over time.  However, the private companies have pocket the profits and the taxpayer is picking up the tab for the massive clean-up operation.  I was given figures by officials in the environment department of Cork City Council which indicated that there had been a more than tenfold increase in illegal dumping in the period from privatisation and the introduction of the charges.<\/p> <p>  Another service that has been reduced is housing provision.  In one particular year when I was a member of the council the housing budget was reduced by 90% for local authority house building.  The number of local authority houses built in recent years was in the low hundreds nationally.  The Government will argue that the process has been reversed and that local authority house building is being ramped up.  If it is, it is happening far too slowly, but councils are handicapped by the fact that the direct labour units that were onceavailable - councils had their own bricklayers, carpenters and skilled tradespersons - are no longer available and the work is being farmed out to private operators.  The tendering system is holding things up, causing delays in the middle of a housing crisis.  <\/p> <p>  When I was a member of the council, it controlled water services, but we then had the creation of Irish Water.  The Chairman is raising his eyebrows because he does not want to get into that topic, but I make the point in passing that it is clear that there was a privatisation agenda.  However, it was stymied and blocked by the protest campaign.  Nevertheless, control of water services is no longer in the hands of the local authorities.  I could go on.  I have given as examples waste management, housing and water services.  I am surprised that the Minister of State has asked councillors what extra powers they might be given and that no response has been given.  I could answer the question very easily and have pinpointed a number of issues straight off the bat.  If I had more time, I could go further. <\/p> <p>  I do not believe the issue of directly elected mayors is totally separate and unrelated.  There has been a drive towards market policies, neoliberalism, privatisation and the stripping of powers from local authorities and the issue of directly elected mayors is now on the agenda.  Directly elected mayors in cities like Dublin and Cork will be relatively powerful, rising above the powers of councillors to a certain extent as they fashion themselves to having a kind of chief executive officer role.  The two things go hand in hand - on the one hand, powerful chief executive officers and, on the other, a neoliberal policy directed at local authorities throughout the State.  The people would be far better served if we were to reverse gears and scrap the policy on directly elected mayor and instead gave councils real powers, starting with the restoration of powers in areas such as bin collection services and the establishment of direct labour units in housing departments.  We should not just reverse the cuts but also seriously increase the finance available to councils in order that they could get to grips with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#J00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>I suspect that we do not agree on many of the issues raised by the Deputy in the first half of his contribution.

There are about 10,000 acres of State forestry just above my home place and the scale of illegal dumping is huge.  It is in close proximity to a number of large urban centres and while the local authority does great work in trying to tidy up the mess, there is no doubt that there has been a huge increase in illegal dumping in certain parts of the country and that it is a blight on the landscape.<\/p><p>Generally, local authorities respond quickly.  While issues can arise with site ownership when dumping takes place on private property, I tend to find that councils are responsive enough.<\/p><p> The privatisation of bin collection services has been discussed on many occasions.  It is true that it is an example of an activity in which councils were previously involved, but they no longer have this power.  However, they still have forums in which they deal with waste, water and housing service matters.  Some local authorities kept their housing maintenance functions when they lost the broader house-building function, which means that there are still some tradesmen operating within local authorities.  A large number of houses came into local authority use at the height of the Celtic tiger when Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was working reasonably well, if somewhat differently from local authority to local authority.  The reality is that after ten years of recession, many builders have left the country.  Many people of my age who were involved in the construction sector have left it.  As a result of this and the change that took place with Part V, local authorities have been removed from the direct provision of local authority housing.  There are many houses at various stages of planning and development across the country.  I do not think it matters to the recipient of a local authority house whether the house is built by somebody who is directly employed by a local authority or by a developer on licence or contract to the local authority.  The problem is that we do not have enough local authority houses, but more are being developed.<\/p><p> This is the first time I have heard Deputy Mick Barry or anybody from his group speak about the issue of directly elected mayors, on which I have an open mind.  I can see that in certain places across the world benefits have accrued from giving a specific person responsibility for some of the functions of the executive.  We will have a broader discussion when the paper goes to the Government and is brought back here for discussion by members of the committee.  I am not sure directly elected mayors are part of a larger neoliberal agenda in the way described by the Deputy.  I agree with Deputy Shane Cassells that local democracy would not be advanced by creating a position without giving it sufficient functions, powers, roles and scope.  I do not suggest we could not give additional powers, functions and roles to directly elected office holders in the future, if that is what the Oireachtas decides.  I am not sure whether Mr. Lemass has anything to add to what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#J00300","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527755400,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>I would like to make the point briefly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018053100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1527755400,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>As our engagement is with the Minister of State, I need to obtain the approval of members before Mr. Lemass interjects.

The funding for local enterprise offices goes directly to local authorities.  The question of economic development at local level is probably not discussed frequently enough.  The chief executives of local authorities, in particular, are stepping up to take a leadership role in ensuring the various State agencies are co-operating at local level.

He has dealt specifically with spatial and transport planning.  We both know what is at play.  An attempt is being made to acquire resources.

I hope a joint application for funding to enable the development of the second bridge that is needed will be made by Waterford City and County Council and Kilkenny County Council in the near future.

Let us revert to the establishment of the municipal districts and the town councils.  Bray, in my area, has a significant population of between 25,000 and 30,000.  There is a critical mass of people where it does not make sense to have a municipal district.  The issue is identifying that figure.  There are large populations in Bray and even in Wicklow town, which is getting close to 15,000, and the system gets bogged down in trying to implement measures.  Not only do they have to be agreed to a municipal level, they then have to be forwarded to local authority level to be adopted.  That delays and stagnates the process.  Deputy Cassells mentioned a point that I had never thought of, which is that town councils were never allowed to expand the population in their area.  For example, the population immediately outside of Wicklow town was 50% of that in the town.  The town council was not allowed to expand because the county council wanted to maintain its commercial rate base.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of finance, it did not matter whether a town council or a county council ran a deficit, the issue was how it was managed.  That was down to management, not down to the status of the council.  We had bad county councils and we had bad town councils but that was down to the management of finance in both fora.  When one reads the documents, it appears the Minister is half indicating that we can call a municipal district with a population of 15,000 a town district.  He is replacing the word \"council\" with \"district\".  Are we going reverting?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State states that he will give town councils more financial powers and more financial autonomy.  Equally, he made a statement there would be efficiencies in going back to one finance system.  If each municipal district has financial autonomy and is given powers in respect of commercial rates and parking charges, together with changes to the local property tax, we are going back to the same financial model.  The Minister of State is giving them the strength.  I am not too sure why he will not say there is a move back to the town council model in what is being put before us here.<\/p> <p>  There is a critical population level at which the county council structure does not work and, therefore, significant powers and resources need to be given to a municipal body to tackle that.  It is not working in Bray in respect of housing, rent collection, and planning, especially in respect of the town plan.

We are not going back to town councils, partly because some places had town councils and others that were much bigger did not.  Some boundaries did not reflect the modern reality of towns but a town should not be seen in isolation.  Most towns have a natural hinterland.  What is envisaged in the review that is about to be published on 13 June is that the natural hinterland will be included with the town and that it will not just end at an arbitrary town boundary that might have been fixed in the 1950s, and that additional fundraising powers, as well as spending powers, will be given to municipal districts.
