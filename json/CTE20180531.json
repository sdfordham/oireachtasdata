He is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the minutes of previous meetings.  Are the minutes of meetings from 15 May, 16 May, 23 May and 24 May agreed?  Agreed.  There is one matter arising out of the minutes from the meeting of 24 May.  It regards category B correspondence, No. 1277, which we discussed last week.  The correspondence in question is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and he provided much helpful and useful information regarding unfinished housing estates, the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, the local authority mortgage resolutions arrears process and the taking in charge of estates.  The resolutions process dealt with the number of repossessions obtained by local authorities.  People will have seen the figures, which were quite high in some areas but not in others.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up that letter asking Mr. McCarthy to supply information relating to evictions achieved by local authorities.  We have the figure for repossessions involving people with shared ownership loans and mortgages - they are staggering in some counties - but we would like to see the figures for evictions achieved by local authorities.  We would also like to see which were done on foot of a court order or otherwise, as the case may be.  We know people have been evicted for non-payment of rents and possibly other reasons.  It would be useful to get that information for each of the past three years, taking in 2015 to 2017, inclusive.  I would like to get the figure from the voluntary housing associations funded by the taxpayer as well.  It is a matter we have not touched but when we saw the figure for repossessions by local authorities, the next question would be in respect of tenants in voluntary housing associations and evictions achieved.  This takes in local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  We should get the information and take it from there when we get it.  Is it agreed to seek that additional information?  Agreed.  Members should understand that it is about following up the excellent information provided on the previous occasion.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A refers to briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1333A is from the office of the chief administrative officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, enclosing the internal audit report of the ICT payments process.  We will note and publish this.  There was a previous report provided to the committee.  No. 1344A is from the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, providing his opening statement.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers to follow up previous meetings of the committee.  There are a number of items in this category, starting with a letter from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen of the State Claims Agency, as well as correspondence from the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I want to group these together in one discussion as different letters have popped up.  We will come to it in a moment but I would like to get the other items of correspondence out of the way.  Is that okay?<\/p> <p>  No. 1329 is correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Deputy O'Brien had a query about this matter, which regards the contract with the new national lottery operator and assurances given with respect to unclaimed prizes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>This is seeking further information.

If a commitment was given, we want to know if it was followed through into the subsequent contract.  The commitment is to go through the transcripts of the debate on the legislation.  Deputy Howlin brought it through when he was Minister.  I was a spokesperson for the Opposition dealing with it.  I have not checked the record but I suspect the item would have come up for discussion.  I would be surprised if it did not.  Deputy McDonald was probably part of the committee when we discussed the matter.  We will go through the debates relating to the passage of the legislation allowing the national lottery to be essentially privatised.  We can perform a search for the term \"unclaimed prizes\" and see what discussion took place and if the then Minister gave any commitments on the matter.  When we get that, we can follow through.

Mr. Mitchell requests that as Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross report is subject to a Garda investigation and that we do not publish it in unredacted form or deal with it publicly.  Can we note this, we might discuss it tonight but I have looked at some of this?  This matter has been aired very publicly on the national airwaves.  I am discussing this now briefly and I am asking people not to say anything that might implicate any particular individual because if there are Garda investigations under way we will certainly not cut across those.  However, I think there are matters on the internal audit that are smack bang within the remit of this committee to discuss and we will do that so I hope people will understand what I am saying there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I had raised this first.  I had asked that we write to the HSE to request a copy of the audit.  I fully appreciate the request that we do not discuss someone in detail for the reason the Chair gave that it is subject to a Garda investigation and some of the individuals involved have a right to protection as well so I have no difficulty with that.  The one thing I took from the audit itself and what was in the media reports, because a lot of this is in the media, was the attitude of the organisation as a corporate body to the audit.  I found it to be quite shocking to be honest.  Leaving aside all the issues which we will not go into, it was the response from the organisation to the audit that shocked me.  We see lots of audits and reports where there is a finding or an opinion, whether it is a Comptroller and Auditor General report or an internal audit report and an organisation may not agree fully with the finding or the recommendations.  There would be some commentary but it seemed to me that the attitude of the corporate body was \"nothing to see here, hands off and how dare you even come in and ask questions\".  That seemed to me be the attitude so there are certainly issues for the PAC.  We always look at process and whether the governance issues that should have been in place were robust and it seems they were not.  We have been here before so this is not the first of the section 38 organisations that have been before us unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  If I remember correctly, when I raised this we had the HSE in some time ago where we discussed generally what improvements were being made and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was saying that improvements had been made on the back of our meetings and the work the HSE was doing and that the issues in this audit go back to a period a number of years ago where improvements have happened since.  It might be unfair to us to say that there is still a huge problem but these issues still need to be ventilated some way.  Maybe I will leave it at that and if we want to deal with it in private session or under our work programme we can but I certainly think we need to examine some of the issues.  I am open to how we do that and I am deeply conscious of what the Chair said at the start as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#C00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am conscious of that.

These are facts.  The property was later sold for &euro;37,500 without being put up for sale on the open market which resulted in a loss based on the original estimated value and the cost incurred.

I note that Deputy Darragh O'Brien has indicated.  Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. John Connaghan, director general of the HSE.  Interestingly, he was the interim director general last week but he has written his signature above the title of director general on correspondence that was issued this week.  I believe he has a big job ahead of him.  We were concerned because we were given evidence that people had informed the State Claims Agency that all of the women involved had been informed about their audit, whereas the State Claims Agency wrote back last week and said very straight that this was inaccurate, so we asked the HSE to respond accordingly.  We need to discuss the matter, which is a culmination of some of these issues in CervicalCheck.  I ask the secretariat to display the letter, No. 1348, on the screen so everyone has it in front of them.  People can view the correspondence on the screen now.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>At the request of the HSE, SCA officials met with officials of the HSE, including Mr J Gleeson Programme Manager CervicalCheck.<br \/><br \/>The purpose of the meeting was to clarify the apparent difference as to the content of a telephone call between the SCA legal team and Mr J Gleeson which occurred during the trial of V Phelan v HSE and another.  The context of the telephone call was to discuss matters pertaining specifically to the case.  The issue of all the other women (the subject matter of the audit) being informed arose as a brief discussion issue.<br \/><br \/>While Mr Gleeson cannot recollect the specifics of the conference call with the SCA in April 2018, we clarified Mr Gleeson's understanding was consistent with the record of the call.  Mr Gleeson's understanding of the communication with the women was that at the time he assumed the women had been informed by their treating physicians.  We now know that this was not the case.<br \/><br \/>Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved.<\/blockquote> <p>Obviously that is to the satisfaction of the HSE and the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p> My issue, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is we are given very definitive, categoric evidence in public session and immediately afterwards we find it is not the case.  That is a problem for the committee in terms of witnesses appearing before us.  It is not about the cervical cancer issue; it is about evidence.  The committee has to have an absolute assurance that evidence given here is correct because if it is not correct we are all on the wrong track.  That is the issue I am concerned with.  Deputy O'Brien indicated he wished to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#D03700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am not happy with this and I will tell the Chairman why.  The issue is not whether Mr. Gleeson was of the understanding the women had been informed or not.  The issue was he sat in that chair and said he did not have a conversation with the SCA and he did not tell them that all of the women had been informed.  It is not an issue of whether he was of that belief or not.  He categorically said he did not speak with the SCA and neither did anyone from CervicalCheck.  That is the issue.  He cannot now come back and say that he had the conversation, that he told them this, that he was under that belief and that is now resolved.  The issue around the HSE and the agency may be resolved in the context of the apparent difference in understanding of whether women were told or not.  I do not want to use the word \"lie\", but we have somebody who came before a committee and who did not give us accurate information and even denied having a conversation, and now we know that not only did he have the conversation, he said what we all knew at that meeting.

In that scenario, we have to question having confidence in a management team that appears before the committee and gives information that, for whatever reason, is inaccurate.  Not alone is it inaccurate but it is based on a case that was in the High Court.  This is pretty serious stuff and we will have to have a discussion about what we do about this.  If the SCA had not written to us last week, we would be none the wiser.  It begs the other question: what else is inaccurate?  What else do we not know about?  It raises a serious question for Mr. Connaghan.  What will he do about it?  He has a management team, previous and current, that has given inaccurate information to the Committee of Public Accounts based on a High Court case.  If Vicky Phelan had signed the confidentiality clause, we would not even be talking about it in the first place.  This raises deeper questions.  We should write to the SCA, verify that it agrees 100% with the context and the way in which the letter was written and ask if it has any other further clarifications or information it wants to give to us.  Second, we have to seriously consider the impact of being given information like this which is completely inaccurate for us and which is based on other evidence given to us.

As I simply do not accept that at face value, I believe Mr. Gleeson has to appear before us again.<\/p><p> We should not, however, miss the bigger point, which is what An Teachta Kelly was getting at.  I am giving my opinion from what I have heard.  We look at process failures and systems failures but there is a sense that a deliberate strategy was put in place to limit the number of women made aware of the results.  That is the bigger issue.  In my view, Mr. Gleeson was at the core of the decision-making in that regard.  I do not believe that issue should be lost in the confusion over emails and what was said or not said.  The Committee of Public Accounts should produce a report from that perspective and should not encroach on the work of Mr. Scally or anyone else.  We have had a number of meetings, however, and cannot just bookend them saying we have had discussions with witnesses because we have our job to do.<\/p><p> There were three elements to the strategy.  One was to limit the number of women who knew.  The second was to get those who knew and who had legal recourse to sign confidentiality clauses.  Where that did not work, the third element was to drag it out through the courts.  Ms Vicky Phelan rumbled all that.  That is my sense of it.  It is only my sense of it so I am not speaking for the committee.  I do not believe we can forget the strategy.<\/p><p> As the Chairman knows, some of the women involved were in Leinster House again yesterday.  Some of them are still taking cases in the High Court.  Women who are dying are still in the High Court fighting the system.  We have to have their backs.  Deputy Fleming, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, promised them that we would fight their corner for them so we cannot just drop the matter and say that is it.  At the very least, we have to produce a report and give our view on whether we feel there were systems values.  I know the word \"cover-up\" was used by the solicitor for Ms Phelan.  That is still an allegation.  I do not believe Mr. Scally will be looking at that.  I would imagine that if there were failures he will come back and state that.  Then we will need a commission of investigation.  If that happens, it will be locked into a two-year process whereby nobody will be able to talk about the matter again.  That is what happens with these commissions.  We have been here before with all these issues.  I am just making the point that we started a process and made a commitment and promise to the victims at the centre of this.  Not only because we made a commitment, but because of our responsibility, we need to see it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#E02800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I find the letter shocking.  I have serious questions over the fact that the director general has put his name to this.  I am not given to extreme statements but am inclined to make one when I see a new director general coming forward in a situation like this, where there was clear evidence from the State Claims Agency, to say he decided to bring the two together to have a meeting.  We have no minutes of that meeting.  He refers to an \"apparent difference\".  There was nothing apparent about it; there was a difference.  Now we are talking about apparent differences, assumptions and consistencies.  There is something seriously amiss.  I find this letter totally unacceptable.  The last line states: \"Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved.\"  As a member of this committee, I believe nothing has been resolved for me.  There was no \"apparent difference\".  It has already been said this is a very serious issue.  We have only a very limited, specific role in it.  When we are given differing accounts as evidence, it is then up to us, not the HSE, to make decisions on how to resolve it.  The representatives of the organisations in question, including the director general, need to appear before us again.  We will hear what has been said and we will make conclusions in our report.  We have no choice but to do that.  I say that most reluctantly because there is a much bigger issue here for the women.  We need an investigation as quickly as possible.

If the HSE is saying that is the misunderstanding and that the State Claims Agency and HSE are now happy it has been clarified, that is the end of the matter.

The combined expenditure under those arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;27.8 million.  Within that total, expired contracts had been extended beyond the specified contract end date for 27 procurements with combined expenditure of just over &euro;20 million.  This included procurement of information and communications technology, ICT, goods and services, some of which were the focus of the internal audit examination being considered by the committee today.<\/p> <p>  More generally, I would point out that, as part of the annual audit of accounts of financial statements, we review the work and outputs of internal audit units.

These include the management of the emergency 999 communications control centre; incident recording; criminal investigations; fingerprints; registration of EU nationals; and international policing and security co-operation and information exchange.<\/p> <p>  In addition, ICT is being increasingly used in new ways to support the organisation&rsquo;s daily activities in areas such as strategic planning, data analysis and modelling of the organisation and its functions.<\/p> <p>  In delivering such services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always been very conscious of the need to ensure the ICT budget available to it is maximised and is invested in a cost effective manner.  Despite its capital budget being reduced by 50% as a result of the recession and the level of staffing being below those of other Departments, the Garda ICT department has successfully delivered a number of major projects, such as the TETRA radio communications network, e-vetting and an automated number plate recognition system that have enhanced the delivery of policing and security services.<\/p> <p>  Delivering these kinds of new services, as well as maintaining ICT services to an organisation of more than 15,000 people who work in a very complex environment, would not have been possible without a comprehensive approach to governance and project management.<\/p> <p>  In line with other public sector bodies, the annual Garda ICT budget is approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  Annual ICT expenditure is reviewed regularly in that given year by the executive director of Garda ICT.  In addition, it is subject to review by the ICT governance board, which is chaired by the chief administrative officer, and includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ICT governance board meets on a quarterly basis.<\/p> <p>  A key element of the organisation&rsquo;s modernisation and renewal programme is the need to upgrade, replace and develop new ICT systems.  In taking on these initiatives, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faced the challenge of progressing ICT projects where the number of people employed in ICT is significantly lower than in similarly sized public sector organisations.  As a result, and, additionally, in order to maintain critical policing and national security ICT systems on a 24-7, 365 days a year basis, it was necessary for the ICT department to avail of a very significant level of external skilled resources.<\/p> <p>  By their nature, given the range of ICT services to be provided and supported, contracts with suppliers can be very complex.  The skilled resource contract with the largest provider of external resources to the organisation commenced in 2009.  The contract has been rolled over to ensure the continued operation of ICT services and, given the complex nature of the procurement required, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged the assistance of a specialist ICT service to assist developing a procurement approach which would maximise competition opportunities.  A series of tenders have issued, with more currently progressing, and contracts with a number of different suppliers have been awarded.  Over this period, the cost of the existing contract was carefully managed, with the average cost per resource decreased by 8%.<\/p> <p>  The report by the Garda internal audit service raised a number of issues, which are being addressed.  For instance, since last year, all external staff working under the skilled resource contract in ICT are subject to the Garda electronic time recording system.<\/p> <p>  Since receiving the approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework to tender for new skilled resources, a series of procurement competitions have commenced.  To maximise competition options, the existing contract has been broken into five tenders for different services, namely, ICT service desk provision; IT operations; ICT security; ICT application development; and support for the strategic transformation office.  These tenders are at different stages of the procurement process.  Subject to the outcome of the five tender processes, which are independent and operate via open competition, we would anticipate that reliance on a single provider in this area will significantly reduce.<\/p> <p>  Over the past year, the number of inhouse skilled resources in ICT has begun to increase and will increase further in the coming years.  Increased numbers and skills, combined with new structures in the ICT department, will reduce the level of dependency overall on external contractors.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of agreed rates, all rates are contained in the master services agreement and annual project documents.  There are no verbally agreed rates.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the internal audit service raised the issue of pre-payments.  The decision to apply prepayments is in line with the overall Garda budgeting process and has resulted in a 5.5% discount.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, ICT plays a fundamental role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na providing a service that protects and supports communities.  We fully recognise the need to ensure that investment in ICT is in line with public procurement rules and provides value for money.  Our approach to breaking-up the skilled resources contract will assist us in this and our focus on increasing the number of our personnel working in ICT will reduce our overall reliance on external contractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018053100002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1527753600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Deputy Alan Kelly will be the first speaker and he will have 20 minutes.

What level of credit check do the witnesses do in respect of organisations to which he makes prepayments because if they are gone, they are gone and they will not get them back?  What kind of ongoing monitoring is done in that regard?  When a contract is signed today that will run for a couple of years, it might be fine on the day the credit check is done and the contract is signed but where there is a prepayment system in place, there has to be some annual update of a credit check.  Sometimes the published financial statements might provide hints.

Perhaps it is half serious.<\/p> <p>  Five weeks ago, we went through all this in the justice committee.  I asked a range of questions which Mr. Nugent came back to me on late last night.  I have the answers on my phone.  The answers to my questions, which were meant to be delivered within two weeks, were sent yesterday, five weeks later, and they were not satisfactory.  I will go through some of them but they were not satisfactory.  I had to chase for the answers.  I will get back to them.  I used the phrase \"cat and mouse\" but that is what is going on because trying to get straight answers to a number of questions is borderline impossible at this stage.  <\/p> <p>  Well done on the audit, which was necessary.  There needs to be an investigation into the way in which some of these contracts were handled.  I say this with officials of the Department of Justice and Equality present and with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality watching proceedings.  There should be an investigation into how contracts in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to some companies were handled because of the volume of money and the lack of procurement processes.  Mr. Kelly has outlined it.  It is not acceptable in modern times that this would happen with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it would not enforce procurement rules in respect of rolling contracts.  It is not acceptable that it would have people on site dealing with very sensitive information not clocking in so it would have no knowledge of what they are doing, how they are doing it or what hours they are doing.  The audit states, \"No assurances can be given that procurement rules were being followed on major IT contracts in the force\".  It stated that there was a lack of a paper trail over key financial agreements.  I ask Mr. Kelly whether that is correct.<\/p> <p>  I presume acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in has read this audit in detail and I presume he has taken action as a consequence.

Mr. Kelly has agreed that the contract was within the proper timeframes up until 2014.  Between 2009 and 2014 that contract was valid.  There was a period in 2015 when it was out of date.

Therefore, there is governance in place.  Those boards meet quarterly.  Subordinate to those, there are individual project boards which deal with the internal projects on which we are working within the projects.  On a routine basis, within ICT, I manage money monthly.

We both want to ensure that long-term financial services which are not of a fixed or definite duration can be investigated by the ombudsman under the longer time limits applying to long-term financial services.  These Government amendments are squarely aimed at ensuring that financial services which are long-term in nature but which do not specifically fix their duration can be investigated by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  <\/p> <p>  The first amendment is technical and is required by the substantive amendment.  The substantive amendment allows the ombudsman to investigate cases where the duration is not fixed but where it is reasonable for a consumer to expect its duration to be longer than the five years and one month threshold by virtue of the manner in which the services operate, the type of assets with which it is connected, or by virtue of representations made by the financial service provider.  It specifically excludes current accounts and other financial services of an indefinite duration which do not have such characteristics.  <\/p> <p>  I appreciate that this is a complex amendment, and I can see the attraction of the simplicity of the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  However, I consider that it would capture more than we agreed we would include in the expanded definition of long-term financial service.  For example, a consumer opening a current account on starting his or her first job or when he or she goes to college might reasonably expect that it will last more than five years, but we have been clear that such a product is not and should not be considered a long-term financial service.  <\/p> <p>  These Government amendments mean that whole of life cases, which are not of fixed duration by definition, can be investigated by the ombudsman subject to the time limit in section 51 of the 2017 Act.  Contrary to the common understanding that these time limits rule out misconduct that occurred prior to 2002, the current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate cases outside this limit in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, \"such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period\".  This gives the ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period to cover events that occurred earlier than 2002.  However, I should stress that there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.  There must be reasonable grounds and it must be just and equitable in all circumstances.  This means it must be just and equitable to both sides, both the consumer and the financial service provider.  <\/p> <p>  Officials from the Department were in detailed discussions with the Office of the Attorney General to see whether it was possible for the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft a constitutionally robust amendment which would allow whole of life complaints to be made to the ombudsman without time limits.  However, I would have concerns that it is arguably unfair and potentially unconstitutional to require the ombudsman to depart from these time limits regardless of whether he considers it fair or reasonable.  The key question for legislative time limits for the bringing of complaints or legal actions is whether the Oireachtas has struck a reasonable balance between the rights of the plaintiffs, the applicants, the interests of the defendants-respondents, and the public interest.   <\/p> <p>  I believe that the current Act, with the proposed Government amendments, strikes a reasonable balance.  For these reasons I am pressing the Government amendments and cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":929,"content":"<p>We welcome this group of amendments, which take aim at the same points, the inclusion of certain groups that, by the spirit of the legislation, should have redress to the Financial Services Ombudsman but which the ombudsman has ruled currently do not qualify.  I am of the view that it is possible and arguable that the findings of the ombudsman could be challenged, but the best thing to do is to clear up any uncertainty by making it crystal clear and precise that they do indeed qualify.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, wrote to the Minister in October about this issue.  The Minister responded positively and has acted with the amendments tabled today.  The group in question are members of one member schemes which fell foul of the definition of long-term financial service.  The issue was the definition of the word \"fixed\".  Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment sought to remedy this problem by introducing a new definition of a financial service in which the consumer could reasonably expect the service to last more than five years and one month, the point being that the definition of \"fixed\" was too restrictive.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister of State has outlined in his comments, his amendments very much tackle the same issue, and we are satisfied that they resolve it.  We will consequently support those amendments and will withdraw our own.<\/p> <p>  The next challenge, as we see it, is amendment No. 5, which I believe has been ruled out of order.  We should all be of one mind on the issue it raises; it allows access to the Financial Services Ombudsman for those people who bought whole of life insurance products and other whole of life products before 2002.  There are some concerning issues being brought to the attention of Deputies about these cases.  The interpretation of the 2002 Act by the ombudsman means that these people are being barred from the process.  Amendment No. 5, which has been disallowed, was tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty, and would have made an attempt to get to the heart of this issue.  At the core of the legislation recently passed was a new rule that a consumer complaint within three years of being aware of an issue, or that they could reasonably be considered to have become aware of it, would allow a person access to the Financial Services Ombudsman process.  This replaced the old six year blanket rule.  Many people have benefited from that change, but in the case of very long-term products backstop has become a problem.  We can make no judgment of the merits of the cases or whether the complainants have a good case or otherwise, but the point is that they deserve access to the process.  This is something that Deputy Pearse Doherty and my party intend to return to on Report Stage.  Given that the amendment was ruled out of order, I would like the Minister of State to commit to dealing with this issue and will consider it at that stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>We have carried out a good deal of analysis on this matter.  We are satisfied that the legislation that was passed last year is sufficient.  I will read the note and we can then discuss it through the Chair.  The current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate complaints about long-term financial services that occurred before 2002 in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, \"such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period\".<\/p><p>This gives the Ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period.  I would stress there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.  There must be reasonable grounds and they must be just and equitable to both the consumer and the financial service provider.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman to make this decision and the Ombudsman is independent.  The follow-on from that is important because it is something on which we are all like-minded.  We want the Ombudsman to have the authority to deal with these matters.  The Ombudsman has the authority.  It is a matter for his discretion whether to use that authority.<\/p><p> I have a note that I want to put on the record.  The Ombudsman will always consider whether the exercise of this discretion is appropriate when a long-term financial service is not being investigated due to time limits.  The exercise of this discretion does not have to be requested by the complainant.  I understand from the conversation between Department officials and the Ombudsman that there were only a small number of cases.  I did not get the actual number of cases or whether the requester has requested him to exercise his discretion.  To date, the Ombudsman has not exercised this discretion.<\/p><p> We are satisfied that the legislation is solid and that it is allowable for the Ombudsman to investigate but, as of now, he has not sanctioned any of those requests that have come to him.  I do not have the actual number to go beyond the 2002 period.  We have done our bit.  The members, as Members of the Oireachtas, have done their bit in regard to the legislation.  We are satisfied it is sufficiently strong.  It then moves to the Ombudsman for him to exercise his discretion to facilitate an investigation to a pre-2002 long-term financial services product.<\/p><p> As Deputy Michael McGrath has just arrived, I will read the note again.  Section 51 of the 2007 Act, the Act that we all put a good chunk of time into dealing with last year to get over the line, provides for a departure from a rigid six-year rule because the complainant has three years from the date he or she became aware or ought to have become aware of the cause of action to make a complaint.  While there is a general time limit of 2002, in regard to the conduct being complained of there is a provision for the possibility of a longer period extending to before 2002 where the Ombudsman decides it would be reasonable to allow a longer period and would be just and equitable in the circumstances.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman, therefore, to facilitate an investigation prior to the 2002 time schedule that is part of section 51 of last year's Act.  It is a matter for the discretion of the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018053100002#C01400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527757200,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.  It is all well and good to say that in certain circumstances the power exists but it is clear that power or discretion is not being exercised.  I am sure Deputy Doherty and others can furnish him with examples of cases but there are people who are coming up against this obstacle.  There are people who have what are essentially legitimate complaints about products that predate 2002 that have not been able to proceed because of the decisions of the Ombudsman.  At the very least, that requires a further examination.  If these people have complaints, whatever their merits , the spirit of which come within the meaning of the change in the six-year rules, there is clearly a problem in that regard.  I ask that the Minister of State would consider that before Report Stage.  I am sure Deputy Doherty can furnish him with examples.

I sat through it on this side and the other side of the House prior to 11 months ago when I was a member of the committee.  We want the Ombudsman to look at this.  It is very clear.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman to do so.  I respectfully put it to the committee that we do not believe there is more we can do.  We believe it is a matter for the Ombudsman to use his discretion, which he is allowed to do, to investigate these matters.  The view of everybody on the committee, going back to last year, was that these would be allowable and investigable by the Ombudsman.  That is very clear in my mind from when I moved to this side of the committee addressing the Members and also, when I was a member of the committee, being addressed to by other members of Government.  The spirit of the legislation is very clear.

On a separate occasion I will ask the committee to write to the Ombudsman to look for data on the number of cases that have come before him that are in this category where the alleged mis-selling, for example, would have occurred prior to 2002 and where he has opted not to use the discretion to avail of the powers this Oireachtas gave to him under the Act to have a look-back.  In that context, we should be looking for the information on the number of those cases, his reasons and his interpretation of the legislation on which we all worked hard to secure its passage.<\/p> <p>  We spoke on Second Stage about the issue of whole-of-life policies, which are very important.  There are many people who have been very badly burned, so to speak, and I know the Minister of State is also aware of individual cases.  I have sat down with many of those people and I am convinced that the terms and conditions of those products were not fully explained.  There is certainly a case to be made in some instances that there was mis-selling, therefore, it would be very disappointing if the Ombudsman decided not to use the powers the Oireachtas gave him.  It comes down to the interpretation of the reasonable grounds to extend the look-back prior to 2002.  That is something we need to tease out further.  We need to keep an open mind on this issue between now and Report Stage but it is very important that the committee would seek that clarification prior to Report Stage and that we reserve the right to introduce more explicit amendments at that stage to remove any element of doubt and make this absolutely clear.  Obviously, they need to be constitutional but if we need to further strengthen the option the Ombudsman has to look back prior to 2001, I and my party would be in favour of that.  However, we need an explanation from the Ombudsman first and if we can get that prior to Report Stage, that would be important because there are many long-term products.  It is not just whole-of-life products.  Those are important but there are many other long-term financial products, and those are the very products we designed that amendment for to enable them to be dealt with.  I know mis-selling is a very difficult case to prove if we are looking back over 15 or 20 years in terms of who said what.  The documentation may be limited.  It is a very difficult case to prove but I am disappointed to hear that the Ombudsman has had that power for a period of months and has chosen not to exercise it.
