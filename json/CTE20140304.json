It was good to see so many of the members outside when we held a protest earlier.  There were 3,000 farmers on the streets, which demonstrates the real extent of anger and frustration among them about what is happening in the beef sector and what has happened since the beginning of the year.<\/p><p>  Beef price cuts and specification changes at factory level are seriously eroding confidence in the sector and threatening to derail the Government&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 plan for the &euro;2 billion beef and livestock sector.  At farm level, the price cuts and specification changes will hit all livestock producers over time.  Winter finishers, particularly bull beef finishers, are in the eye of the storm.  Some bull beef finishers are at their wit&rsquo;s end and unable to have cattle killed.  When cattle are killed, farmers are facing price cuts of over 50 cent per kilogram, which can amount to between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per head.  Some producers are facing very real and substantial financial losses this spring.<\/p><p>  I would like to go through some of the details of what has happened in the beef sector and how circumstances have changed in the past year.  First, cattle prices are well down, at levels at which winter finishers cannot make a margin.  Based on official Bord Bia data, compared to this time last year steer prices are down 21 cent per kilogram, or &euro;77 per head.  Heifer prices are down 26 cent per kilogram, or &euro;80 per head.  Bull beef and cow prices have taken much larger hits.  Cow prices are back 56 cent per kilogram, or &euro;174 per head.  Bull beef prices have decreased by an average of 55 cent per kilogram, or &euro;204 per head.<\/p><p>  Let me put the magnitude of these price cuts in perspective.  If they were to be maintained for a full year, the losses to the beef sector would be in the order of &euro;172 million per annum.  In addition to the price cuts, the factories have moved very substantially on specification changes without giving producers adequate notice or time to make adjustments to their stock.<\/p><p>  On bulls, the factories have introduced age and weight limits.  Bulls over 16 months of age or over 400 kg, or both, are now hit with price penalties.  Most of the factories have stated they do not really want bulls.  They would prefer to take steers or heifers, considering that the kill moved from just over 100,000 head in 2007-08 to over 200,000 in 2012.  It was the factories that developed this trade with the producers.  In 2011 factories strongly encouraged farmers not to export their dairy calves and to keep them for bull beef.  Farmers responded and now they cannot have their bulls killed, let alone get a viable price.<\/p><p>  Farmers have been let down and believe the factories have reneged on their commitments.  Farmers increased their production of bull beef as part of the Food Harvest 2020 plan and in conjunction with the State advisory service, Teagasc.  Bull beef production was promoted based on efficiency and performance.  The Derrypatrick suckler herd in Grange, County Meath was developed using an 18 month old bull beef system, with the meat factories involved.  A key element of the Food Harvest 2020 plan was to increase the beef kill from 30,000 per week to 40,000.  The kill is 31,000 to 32,000 per week and factories are telling farmers they are not able to kill their cattle and are pushing stock intake back several weeks.  In many cases, because of these delays, farmers are getting caught by age and weight limits and incurring very severe financial penalties of another 20 cent to 50 cent per kilogram.<\/p><p>  The most recent move by the factories to target prime in-spec steers and heifers with new price and weight cuts, following their meeting with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was a step too far and shows disregard for both the Minister and farmer suppliers.  The steer and heifer price was reasonably stable since Christmas, at &euro;4 per kilogram for steers and &euro;4.10 per kilogram for heifers.  Prices have now been cut to &euro;3.95 per kilogram for steers and &euro;4 per kilogram for heifers.  In addition, some factories have introduced a weight penalty of 20 cent per kilogram on any animal over 400 kg.  Others are using dual base prices using the quality payment system for stock over 30 months.  None of these conditions was part of the quality payment system.  Winter finishers simply cannot endure such losses.  The time has come for the Minister to stand up for farmers and reject the factories&rsquo; tactics.  He must insist on stability and confidence being restored in the beef sector.<\/p><p>  The reality is that there is good market demand for in-spec steers and heifers.  There is no excuse for factories not maintaining the base prices of &euro;4 per kilogram for steers and &euro;4.10 per kilogram for heifers.  In our main export market for steers and heifers in the United Kingdom, Bord Bia reports the R grade steer price is the equivalent of &euro;4.69 per kg and that the R grade heifer price is at &euro;4.66 per kg.  For the average steer, UK prices are &euro;250 per head over Irish prices.  For heifers, the gap is &euro;163 per head.  The gap between prices in Ireland and those in our main export market where half of all our beef is sold is way too large and must be narrowed.  At these price levels, in our largest export market it is very difficult for farmers to understand why prices have come back so much in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In our main European markets cattle prices are reasonably stable.  In Italy R grade male animals are making the equivalent of &euro;4.24 per kilogram, including VAT, which is down 1.5% on last year.  In France R grade male animals are making &euro;4.12 per kilogram, including VAT, which is the same price as last year.  In Germany R grade male animals are making &euro;4.02 per kilogram, including VAT, which is down just 7% on last year.  In Spain R grade bulls are making &euro;4.10 per kilogram, including VAT, which represents the same level as last year.  In general, cattle prices across the main European markets are stable, at slightly over &euro;4 per kilogram.<\/p><p>  Since problems first began to emerge with beef prices last December, the IFA moved and met representatives of the meat plants at local level in early January, outlining the losses at farm level, demanding price stability and a move on the backlog of bulls.  In late January, after our AGM, the IFA met Meat Industry Ireland and senior factory management to demand a halt in the price cuts and an increase in the kill to shift any backlog of bulls.  Following that meeting, the bull kill increased slightly, but the continuing price drops and specification changes were totally unacceptable.  In mid-February 1,500 farmers protested on the cattle price issue outside a number of the main processing plants in counties Meath, Waterford and Tipperary.  The IFA subsequently called on the Minister to call in representatives of the factories and challenge them on their commitment to pay a viable cattle price to farmers.<\/p> <p>The IFA met the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and made it clear that if cattle prices are not stabilised, the current crisis has the potential to totally derail the Food Harvest 2020 plan for the &euro;2 billion beef and livestock sector.  We also made it clear that it is not acceptable to farmers that the Minister would consider he had little or no role with regard to factories on cattle prices, as he had outlined in the D&aacute;il.<br \/>The Minister met the representatives of the factories on Thursday, 20 February.  On Monday, 24 February, the factories reduced the price for steers, heifers, bulls and cows again.  This is clear from the official Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine price reports printed in last week's <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal<\/i>.  These figures show that the price of all four categories of stock came back by between 1 cent and 7 cent per kilo on the week.<br \/>IFA is demanding that the Minister take immediate action to restore some confidence in the beef trade at farm level.  The Minister needs to challenge the factories head-on, on the price and specification issues.  He must stand up for farmers and make it crystal clear to the factories that the price cuts must stop.  The factories need to send a positive signal that beef prices have bottomed out and will not fall further.  In addition, the factories have to send a clear signal to their suppliers that the price of in-spec steers and heifers will not come under further attack and will improve over the spring period.<br \/>The factories and their supermarket clients cannot change the goalposts with new specifications in the middle of the production season.  At this point, farmers calving cows or buying cattle this spring are at a loss as to the direction they should take.  There needs to be real debate and analysis on the specification and the direction in which we want to take our grass-based beef production in Ireland.<br \/>The Minister must bring Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the ICBF, the factories and, most importantly, the farmers around the table on this issue.  Under-16-month bull beef production does not work in a grass-based system.  Tight carcass weights will leave our already under-pressure suckler cow sector uneconomical.  The Minister must also tackle the lack of competition in the beef sector and take action to close the large price gap between Irish beef prices and those of our main export market in Great Britain.<br \/>We have worked hard to secure a new ferry route for live cattle to the United Kingdom.  We now need the Minister to remove the artificial blocks preventing the expansion of the live trade to the United Kingdom, including addressing the labelling difficulties.  This is a market access issue which is preventing the proper operation of the EU Single Market.<br \/>It has also hit the important store trade with Northern Ireland, affecting the mart trade and suckler farmers all across the west and the midlands.  The Minister and Bord Bia need go to the United Kingdom and meet the supermarket bosses and their Government and agency counterparts to resolve these difficulties.  Doing nothing is no longer acceptable.  The large price gap between Irish and United Kingdom cattle prices must be closed.  It is not acceptable that Irish cattle are being blocked out of part of the EU Single Market.  The Minister must also become an advocate for the live export trade to European and other markets.  By doing so, he will improve price competition and increase market outlets.  Farmers believe a strong live export trade for Friesian calves to Spain and Holland, weanlings to continental EU markets and stores to North Africa are essential to keep a competitive balance in the trade.<br \/>Farmers are concerned that factories are being allowed use the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine animal identification and movement, AIM, system database to monitor livestock numbers for individual farmers.  The IFA wants a guarantee from the Minister that the AIM system is absolutely confidential and that factories do not have access to the herd profiles of individual farmers.<br \/>Action from the Minister to restore confidence in the beef sector is urgent and essential.  If the problems in the beef market are not addressed and prices are not stabilised quickly, the sector faces wider implications, particularly regarding the targets set down in Food Harvest 2020, including exports and jobs.  As previously outlined, the price cuts alone will cost &euro;172 million over a full year.  The suckler herd is under severe pressure and the price cuts and specification limits will ultimately hit weanling and store prices, and compound this situation.  The Minister made a positive investment of &euro;52 million per annum with the new &euro;80-per-cow beef genomics scheme for sucklers.  We cannot allow the benefits of this investment to be totally undermined by price cuts and specification changes.  Our suckler herd must be maintained and the factories must invest in this also.  The fallout from the current difficulties has left winter finishers in a difficult position financially.  Winter finishing and year-round beef production is essential to service the higher-priced retail contracts.<br \/>The recent market developments have left farmers sceptical about the industry's expansion plans for beef.  The minute the beef kill goes over 30,000 head per week, the price seems to collapse.  Any further expansion in the sector must be fully planned.<br \/>Factories have to be prepared to provide viable price contracts if there is to be growth in the sector.  Otherwise, farmers must be strongly encouraged to export any additional dairy calves live in order to avoid damage to the beef price, as is happening this spring.<br \/>We are also demanding that the Minister take action on a number of other important issues affecting the beef sector in the future.  The Minister and the Government must strongly defend the beef sector in the current trade negotiations of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and Mercosur, with the US and Brazil, respectively.  He cannot allow beef into our markets from production systems that do not meet European standards.  He and the Government must also introduce retail regulation to restore some balance and fairness in the food chain.<br \/>The IFA acknowledges the work of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on opening new markets all around the world.  He has driven our Origin Green sustainability programme with Bord Bia.  However, the benefits of this work cannot be enjoyed only by a small number of processors and retailers.  The development of the sector requires that the benefits of expansion to be shared throughout the entire sector.  This must start with a viable cattle price being delivered for farmers.<br \/>Over the past while, we have seen the effect of this.  The committee should at least listen to farmers this morning on the stress associated with it.  It is shocking to see their incomes being decimated and the pressure that they are under.  Mr. Henry Burns, our livestock chairman, who is present, has seen at first hand the effect of that and might comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400003#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393942200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will take the opening statements and then let Mr. Burns comment, if that is agreed.

It is disappointing enough to see the steer price back 13% compared to its peak of last summer.  It is a big problem for winter finishers to see the price weakening over the costly winter months.<\/p><p>  However, the real disaster relates to the young bull beef price.  Young U3 bulls are on average back 21% in price since last summer.  However, the average U-grade bull price neither even begins to tell the story of how the goalposts have been moved in terms of specification nor tells the story of the immense pressure being put on winter finishers, who are being treated with contempt and who cannot get cattle killed when they need to.  Overnight, the bull over 16 months is apparently no longer wanted.  Maximum carcass weight has been reduced, in some cases to as low as 380 kg.  Bulls a day over 24 months are worth considerably less than old cows.<\/p><p>  The impact on the suckler trade is potentially devastating.  Suckler farmers producing top-of-the-range continental bull weanlings cannot continue unless there are viable markets for this type of stock.  Live exports are vital but on their own, they are not enough.  How can we expect Irish finishers to have confidence to bid for &euro;1,000 euro weanlings when specifications are being changed at the drop of a hat?  How can a finisher take advantage of grass to grow the bull a bit at low cost, and then get these cattle killed at 16 months and at a maximum of 380 kg, and make a profit, especially as the Irish U-grade bull beef price in February was a full 25% behind the equivalent Italian price?<\/p><p>  It is important to emphasise that it is the top-quality suckler producer who is most affected by this.  These are the farmers who have invested heavily in breeding growthy, lean continental cattle.  These are the suckler farmers who face the challenges of more hard calvings and higher costs.  These are the farmers who are barely breaking even at best.<\/p><p>  I anticipate that the publication by Teagasc of the results from all profit monitors completed under beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, will be a real wake-up call.  Already we know from our members' anecdotes just how poor suckler returns are when they have completed the profit monitor.<\/p> <p>It is now clear that the Food Harvest 2020 targets for beef are complete pie in the sky.  While it is positive that the Minister has been energetic in developing new international export markets, the reality is that farmers are seeing no benefit from this at present.  Farmers feel frustrated that there seems to be no great appreciation of the bull beef crisis.  They are paying significant levies on cattle that are slaughtered and are asking how this can be afforded in a sector that is showing losses.<\/p><p> The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, has come here today to impress on members that this is a real crisis for the industry we represent.  There is a strong feeling that the Minister is not taking it seriously enough.  We can hide for the time being behind the overall agrifood exports figures for 2013 but the reality is that 2013 will not be repeated in the beef sector.  The ICSA wants action on the beef crisis and I will now hand over to the ICSA beef chairman, Mr. Edmond Phelan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393942800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As beef chairman I do not think I can ever recall a time when there was so much pessimism regarding the beef sector.  Farmers are sick of the uncertainty, particularly relating to feeding cattle over the winter.  While it is all very well to suggest one should feed steers and not bulls, the former are a lot less efficient than bulls at converting feed into carcass weight.  It takes a good performance to put on a half kilogram of carcass weight per day on a steer.  If the value of that kilogram is only &euro;4 and the cost of feeding that animal is &euro;3.50 per day, it is obvious that winter finishers of steers cannot survive without a price rise over the winter period.  That price rise must be in the order of 3 cent per kilogram per week but instead, there have been price drops in 2014.<\/p><p>  The bigger picture is that beef producers cannot be expected to absorb continually unanticipated losses.  Meat processors and retailers have a lot of soul searching to do.  Retailers seem to think they have a right to beef produced at below the cost of production and processors are happy to collude with this.  In addition, the processing industry must be held accountable on a number of issues.  We still have had no proper explanation as to how the horsemeat scandal happened and nor do we have any sign of political will to punish the guilty.  Farmers are sick of the extent to which they are punished for the slightest error.  They see the heavy hand of the special investigations unit, SIU, being used to deal with the most minor of cases on-farm but they appear totally ineffectual when it comes to deliberate misconduct on an international scale, as was seen with the horsemeat scandal.  Now it seems that farmers are paying the price for this, as factories blame the horsemeat saga for the greater focus on the bull beef specification.<\/p><p>  Farmers have been misled on bull beef by processors.  Less than two years ago, farmers were actively encouraged to buy Holstein bull calves from dairy farmers and were told money could be made by feeding them as bulls.  The consequence was a collapse of the veal export trade and now, when these bulls come on market, we are told we have too many bulls and there is no market for them.  It also is time to look at anti-competitive practices in the beef trade.  In North America, processors are barred from controlling feed lots.  Here, we have an increased numbers of feed lots under the control of beef processors, which are being used to keep a downward pressure on price.  Worse still is the fact that the rendering industry is influenced by a single dominant player in processing and is uncompetitive.  It is clear that all of these things are affecting the beef price paid to farmers and the reality is that price and specification appear to move in remarkable unison.  The ICSA believes that it is now time for the Government to consider appointing a regulator for the meat processing sector.  We have Government regulators for all kinds of private business sectors ranging from banking to telecommunications to broadcasting.  Regulators reflect the fact that while private enterprise is to be encouraged, it cannot be allowed to operate unfettered and without scrutiny.  Such a regulator must have power of investigation and real teeth.  Moreover, it must ensure there is fair competition in the processing sector and that farmers have real choice when it comes to selling their livestock.  The rendering sector needs to separate from processing.  It is amazing that while Ryanair has been prevented from taking over Aer Lingus, we appear to have no concerns about what is happening in the rendering sector.<\/p><p>  The Government must also revisit previous efforts to impose voluntary codes of practice on retailers.  Voluntary codes simply do not work and we need to get real.  It is not satisfactory that retailing is being dominated by a few multinationals but we still have no handle on the breakdown of margins when it comes to farm products such as meat, dairy or vegetables.  I wish to emphasise that farmers are sick of what is going on.  Farmers have bent over backwards to comply with cross-compliance.  They went further and signed up in great numbers to Bord Bia's quality assurance because they were told it was essential in delivering top-priced markets for Irish meat products.  At this point, there is complete frustration with beef quality assurance.  It has been manipulated to the extent that some categories of stock are now subject to huge discounts and in some cases are unsaleable without the certificate, yet quality assured bull beef producers derive no benefit whatsoever therefrom.  While I do not advocate this, many farmers are openly discussing a refusal to participate further in the beef quality assurance scheme and I cannot blame them.  The industry is in trouble and many finishers and suckler farmers are intent on quitting and perhaps rearing dairy replacements on contract.  However, a complete review of what is being achieved by the beef quality assurance scheme is required.  If farmers cannot be assured of some stability, even at a time when the export markets are reasonably secure, what is the point of the scheme at all?  The final straw for some farmers is the fact that the Minister met the processing sector recently but it appears to have been a complete waste of time.  Astonishingly, the Minister did not even issue a press release on the outcome of the meeting.  What does this tell one?<\/p><p>  I will conclude by urging the joint committee to do everything in its power to make the beef crisis a key concern of the Minister and the Government and to push for greater regulation of the processing and retailing sectors, as well as greater focus on the anti-competitive elements to which we have referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Edmond Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1393942800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and invite Mr. John Comer, president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400005#F00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393942800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the opportunity to put our views as to where we perceive the genesis of this crisis to be and on some potential solutions in the future.  This is a real problem on which we have forwarded a comprehensive document to the joint committee.  I would prefer to submit that to the evidential database rather than to read it out.  Instead, if it is all right with the joint committee, I will make a few points in my own words.  A real problem has arisen that highlights the absolute sweeping volatility that can take place in the beef sector overnight.  I have to hand prices that I could use to demonstrate this point but will avoid repetition of the facts and figures regarding the percentages of price falls and so on that already have given by my colleagues in other farm organisations.  In reality, most of this volatility has been concentrated in the past three to four months and we must ask ourselves questions as producers of beef, albeit perhaps a different kind of beef in the future.  At present, the dairy stock here stands at 1.1 million, which is projected to grow and, consequently, much of the beef will be coming from the dairy farmers.  I suggest that over the next five to six years, probably well over half the beef will come from the dairy industry.<\/p><p>  The question is whether that is what the consumers of Europe and the wider world want.  A strategic comprehensive plan is required that will take the scope of the longevity of the production of beef.  At a minimum, from conception to plate, it takes three years if one takes into account the nine-month gestation period and so on.  We cannot end up in a position in which our industry and all the players involved therein tell producers what the marketplace will require but when they get there as producers three years later, there is no margin in it.  The critical phrase in this regard is \"net margin\".  A situation has developed in Ireland over the past six months in which prices fell from an historic high down to a negative price at which the primary producers are not making a margin.  To provide members with an illustration of how pronounced is the problem, I had a telephone conversation with a guy who had a live Limousin bull under 16 months old that was killed out at 580 kg.  The bull was graded as U2 yet his price was cut in the factories by 90 cent per kilogram, which amounted a cut of &euro;457.20.  That meant the farmer's margin was gone and yet, he had been advised to breed that type of animal.  He had been told the consumers of Europe and the world would want that.<\/p><p>  How can one allow such a situation to develop in an industry that is so important to the nation?  There surely must be a better way, that is, a better collaborative approach by all the stakeholders to put in place a structure that at least at a minimum can deliver some sort of margin to the primary producer.  While one could argue this was a reflection of the marketplace, the reality, as illustrated by the other farm organisations, is that in France, Italy and Spain, prices are holding their own.  Moreover, according to the Bord Bia figures that have been produced for the United Kingdom, steer and heifer prices have increased slightly year on year.  There is a deep suspicion abroad regarding the role of the meat plants.  There definitely is a perception that some sort of market manipulation is being orchestrated by other players in the industry's chain in order to take a higher margin for themselves.<\/p> <p>Farmers are saying to me that if it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck then it must be a duck.  Some structure must be put on this.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must take some responsibility in this regard.  His aspirations for Food Harvest 2020 are noble, but rhetoric will not be of any use.  I am not here to specifically target any political organisation but a good deal of work has been done and it will be completely undermined unless the support structures that are put in place are backed up and we find out the reasons this has happened.<\/p><p> As an industry, we need strong competition in terms of live exports.  Irish cattle that are exported to Spain, Italy and other countries are not discounted when slaughtered in those countries, yet we have a situation in which cattle posted on 1 April of this year that are exported to another jurisdiction on the same landmass will be classified as out-of-spec cattle.  How can we in the Republic of Ireland compete in a market in which that change has developed overnight?<\/p><p> In the dairy industry, if somebody changes a specification and it is not the panacea or all that is good and holy in the farming community, at least there is a long lead-in to any changes.  We cannot allow a situation to develop in which the specification changes overnight and the primary producer has no chance of being able to react to what is now perceived by the consumer to be a new requirement in respect of food production.  The Minister, all political entities and people who have been elected to represent the citizens of Europe need to say that we operate in a Single Market and that a situation in which there is a different specification for one type of animal in one jurisdiction and another type of animal in another jurisdiction, to the detriment of the primary producer, cannot be tolerated.<\/p><p> In terms of how we can improve matters, the message I would like to get across here today is that we must bring all the stakeholders in and put in place a strategic plan that is sufficiently robust to be able to analyse, strategise and take away the powers of the middlemen and perhaps the powers of the multiples to dictate an environment that might not necessarily be realistic.  Why is it the case that in another jurisdiction an under-36-month animal is fine for certain consumers in Europe while in our jurisdiction an animal that is over 30 months is deemed to be out of spec?  I am not sure that the system we have augurs well for the future of beef production in this country.  The consumer and the primary producer are being manipulated and we need to find a strategy that will reduce that to the minimum.  What I have said is structured in this document, but I have put my own words on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400005#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393943400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Comer.

This results in almost 1.5 million cattle being presented for slaughter, of which we export almost 90%.  Additionally, we have approximately 200,000 to 300,000 live exports.  Ireland has been a provider of cattle for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom for hundreds of years.  As a nation we are only consuming approximately 10% of what we produce, and in 2013 Ireland produced over 472,000 tonnes of beef meat for export.  The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is only approximately 75% self-sufficient in beef meat and must import approximately 350,000 tonnes of additional beef to satisfy national demand.  Ireland supplies the vast majority of this imported beef meat, as one would expect, due to our proximity.  In 2013 Ireland produced and exported more than 250,000 tonnes of beef meat to the UK, representing almost 70% of its total beef imports.<br \/>During the past number of years our meat processors have introduced what they call a quality bonus payment for cattle that fulfil certain criteria.  This bonus payment now stands at 12 cents per kilogram, which represents an average bonus of &euro;40 to &euro;60 per animal.  In effect, this is not a bonus payment but a penalty on all other animals produced by Irish farmers.  An integral part of qualifying for this bonus payment is adherence to Bord Bia's quality assurance scheme, QAS, which has many criteria for full eligibility.  Regarding the trade and movement of animals, the QAS states that animals must reside in a quality-assured farm for 70 days or more to qualify.  The scheme allows for animals to be traded freely between quality-assured farms and if the cumulative number of days an animal resides on such farms amounts to 70, then the animal retains its quality assurance status. <br \/>The meat plants, however, have effectively usurped the Bord Bia scheme and will only pay their bonus if an animal has resided 70 days or longer in the last herd, goes directly to slaughter from that farm to a meat plant, and has four movements or fewer in its lifetime.  The effect of these additional conditions by the meat plants is twofold: it excludes the possibility of these animals being traded within the last 70 days before slaughter, and it effectively prevents factory-fit animals from being traded in livestock marts.  The rationale for the introduction of these additional conditions by the meat plants is simple and clear: it is being done to subvert fair competition for livestock and ultimately to control prices.<br \/><b><\/b>These bonus payments, we are informed by the meat industry, are due to a customer requirement led by the large British multiples arising from animal welfare concerns.  As I outlined, one of the main criteria for farmers to receive this bonus is having four movements or fewer in the animal&rsquo;s lifetime.  Due to the structure of the Irish beef sector, smaller farms in the west traditionally supply other farmers in the midlands and east of Ireland, and Northern Ireland farmers, with younger store animals.  To facilitate this, these animals require several movements on various farms before these cattle are finally finished on the last farm before slaughter. <br \/>ICOS believes that this measure, along with the other measures introduced by the meat industry, is a form of market manipulation that ensures that transparent price competition is stifled as much as possible.  The meat industry and the UK multiples are fully aware that due to their manipulation of the market in the manner described, farmers are not getting a fair and true market value for their stock.  The UK market is the only European market where these effective barriers to free trade in livestock exist.  Ireland is exporting 200,000 tonnes of identical beef meat to continental Europe without the restrictive stipulations that have been introduced for exports to the UK, allegedly for quality and welfare reasons. <br \/>ICOS contends that the further interference with the trade that is now evident, with the effective ban by meat plants in Northern Ireland on killing cattle from the Republic, is anti-competitive and in contravention of free trade principles within the EU.  The graph in the presentation clearly illustrates the effect of this market manipulation and its distortion of Irish beef prices.  It shows that in the week ending on 8 February of this year the Irish price was a full 60 cent per kilogram less than what was obtained for the same beef in the UK.<br \/>ICOS has a first-hand account of this from farmers in Northern Ireland.  We are aware of cases of Northern Ireland farmers with large numbers of Southern-born cattle that are fit to slaughter who cannot get them killed in the Northern meat plants.  One such farmer has told the ICOS that he is facing financial ruin as he has more than 2,000 Southern-born cattle in his feedlot.  For the past 30 years this farmer has purchased his cattle from marts all across the west of Ireland and has always got them killed in Northern meat plants.  He has now effectively been told that he cannot get these animals slaughtered in Northern meat plants unless he takes a &pound;150 discount, as they were born in the South.  This farmer cannot now export these animals back to the Southern meat plants as his herd has a movement restriction placed upon it due to TB regulations; in other words, it is a closed-slaughter-only herd.  This policy, if retained, will leave this farmer and many others facing financial ruin. <br \/>Typically, these Northern farmers purchased their cattle from the livestock marts in Balla, Ballymote, Mohill, Roscommon, Elphin, Castlerea, Ballinasloe, Athenry, Ballyjamesduff, Ennis, Birr, Nenagh and Roscrea, representing a significant amount of trade for these marts and, more importantly, for local farmers in these areas.  Apart from the obvious benefits of having an additional buyer around the ringside, the &quot;Northern buyer&quot; effect lifts the entire livestock trade on the days these buyers are present, as competition for stock heats up.<\/p> <p>This benefits everyone in the livestock industry and ensures a fair and open price.  A founding principle of the European Union was to ensure free trade between member states by removing barriers to trade.  The Ireland-UK beef trade is now seeing the effective reintroduction of national barriers to trade.  Inaction in this area by the EU and our Government is resulting in large retailers and Irish owned meat factories exercising undue control over the price of beef.<\/p><p> ICOS has raised the issue of barriers to free trade in live cattle on numerous occasions at national and EU level, only to be informed that the EU regulations on meat labelling were to blame.  This assertion is not accurate, however, because retailers find it easy to label beef meat to comply with the regulations when it suits them.  ICOS has been informed that the retailers themselves have conducted market research into the purchasing habits of consumers in the United Kingdom and found no adverse purchasing habits when the label clearly illustrated country of birth, finishing and slaughter of animals.  The BSE crisis of the mid-1990s was the impetus for the introduction of Regulation 1760(2000), which required compulsory beef labelling to be put in place before 1 January 2002.  There is now an urgent need on the part of the Government and the EU to review all of the terms and conditions of trade relating to both beef exports and live exports of livestock to the UK, with a view to ensuring greater transparency and freer competition.  Irish farmers are entitled to get the full value of their stock and they should not be exploited by questionable market restrictions introduced by meat factories with the support of the large retailers.<\/p><p> On a recent visit to England, ICOS gathered evidence of Irish beef and British beef being sold at the same price per kilogram in Tesco stores.  We photographed two identical cuts of brisket beef, one labelled Irish and the other British, on sale for the same price at &pound;8.00 per kilogram.  However, the Irish farmer would have received between 15% and 20% less per kilogram for his or her beef.  This equates to a difference of almost &euro;200 per head.  Where did the extra margin go if the UK housewife was not getting any discount for Irish beef over and above British beef?  In Britain, over 45% of beef is sold through smaller abattoirs and food service outlets which supply restaurants, etc.  These retailers are solely concerned with price and quality.  One would expect them to be an outlet for Irish-born and British-finished cattle.  Unfortunately, that is not the case because these smaller food service abattoirs, while independent, rely on some of the bigger Irish-owned meat renderers to purchase their offal.  Some small abattoir owners have indicated to ICOS that these same Irish-owned renderers were mysteriously unable to collect offal if they killed quantities of Irish-born cattle but had no capacity problems when they were not killing Irish-born cattle.  We met a number of large UK farmers to discuss potential purchases of Irish cattle in their feedlots.  These were farmers who traditionally have purchased and fattened Irish-sourced stock.  They indicated to ICOS that no Irish-owned factory in England would kill Irish-born cattle.  These farmers had in the past bought thousands of Irish cattle and fattened them in feedlots but now they have encountered so much difficulty in getting them killed that they have effectively been forced to cease trading in cattle from Ireland.<\/p><p> ICOS urges the committee to lend its immediate support to addressing the anomalies that have been highlighted in this presentation and ensuring that the necessary measures are taken urgently to rectify this calamitous situation for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Spellman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393944000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>As a vote has just been called in the D&aacute;il, the committee will have to suspend.

The organisations have provided much information and I concur with much of it.  What ICOS said about the marts is a huge issue - the kernel of the issue.  We killed 1.4 million cattle the year before last and 100,000 extra last year.  We are trying to kill 100,000 more this year - in other words, we are trying to kill 1.6 million cattle this year versus 1.4 million two years ago.  The factories and the Minister encourage people to keep these calves, but the bottom line is that the farmer is no longer in the driving seat.  Once a calf is six weeks old, it is trapped on the island of Ireland.  I describe it that way.  The animal appears to be trapped on the island.  Our options are running out and the farmer is paying the price.<\/p><p>  Another very important issue - I know we are not here today to discuss it - is the trade talks with America, Brazil and other places.  Huge damage could be done here.  I think there will be an announcement fairly soon that America is open to beef from Europe, and there will be great fanfare around that.  The American beef market is running at around &euro;1 per kilogram below the Irish or European price.  It is thousands of miles away.  There will be fanfare around the announcement from the Minister, Bord Bia and lots of other people, but the bottom line is that it is &euro;1 per kilogram under the European price.  We have a market 70 miles up the road across the Border and certainly across the water which is &euro;1 per kilogram ahead, but we cannot get into it.  There is a huge logjam here for the Minister to sort out.  <\/p><p>  We have heard about all of these so-called markets, including Japan.  When I put that to the representatives of the meat industry in the context of the current problems we have with marketing and prices, they smile and say they have not got a kilogram in to those markets yet.  We need some reality.  We need to stop stargazing, look closer to home and sort out those problems.<\/p> <p>When we reached that 1.4 million kill figure, farmers appeared to be in the driving seat and the factories were ringing them.  Now they are ringing them and they will not answer the telephone.  As a result of the Minister&rsquo;s meeting with them, the factories issued a press release which included very little but contained a list of telephone numbers of all the factories.  I know one person who had 20 animals to be slaughtered and rang all of these numbers but could only have one animal slaughtered.  I do not know how many factories are on the list, but the press release was published in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>. <br \/>We need to take stock of the competition and what the Minister needs to do.  This started out as a bull beef crisis but then moved to affect what were supposed to be in-spec bullocks and heifers.  It has moved into the marts along the west coast because of a lack of competition from the North of Ireland, which is so important.  Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Michael Colreavy and Senator Michael Comiskey are well in tune with the live trade and the problem has filtered down to the South to affect the dairy calf which is almost valueless.  We were going to be the new boys in town, with the Harvest 2020 strategy.  We were going to be like the <i>Starship Enterprise<\/i>taking off and showing the world how to do things.  People are on the verge of shooting calves or putting them down because they have no value.  Where does that leave us?  This is a huge issue.  We need to consider how to sort out the problem and not end up with it again.<br \/>Looking back to 2010, this country exported 340,000 live cattle.  Two years later it was no accident that we had a tight supply and farmers were able to get a price with a margin.  The factories and the Harvest 2020 project encouraged farmers to keep extra cattle and we are now trying to kill 200,000 more, but the farmer cannot get a price with a margin, which is totally unacceptable.  These are issues for the Minister to resolve.  At one stage he said he had no role.  Then he invited in representatives of the factories.  That is not acceptable.  This is the biggest industry in the country, whether one is a dairy or a suckler farmer.  Whether one is a small farmer in the west or a big dairy farmer in the south, it will take millions of euro out of the industry.  We spent all of last year trying to keep European and rural development moneys in the industry.  As our president said, these cuts have the ability to take &euro;174 million out in a full year.  It is, therefore, a huge issue for the cattle industry.  It is a crisis that affects cattle, marts and farmers and could even affect animal welfare if it is not dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400008#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henry Burns","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393944600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the four organisations for their very informative presentations.  We have a crisis, but it had a long gestation period.  We should face up to this and when we try to resolve it, we should do so not only for the short term but also consider the underlying weaknesses that have caused this chaos.  The first thing that struck me and on which I concentrated when I became spokesperson on agriculture was the need for the farmer to get a fair price for product, whether dairy or beef.  At the beginning it was liquid milk, then vegetables and now beef.  In the case of all three, we have seen manipulation and serious concerns expressed about the way the market works.<br \/>The committee conducted a thorough examination of the grocery sector which focused on the power of the multiple.  We then had several debates on live exports to Britain.  I have persistently asked the Minister why one cannot put a truck on a boat in Dublin when one can do it in Larne to travel to Stranraer.  I am glad that I can kill one red herring today - the British consumer is not paying a heap more for British beef, compared with Irish beef.  The price difference is in the factory, not on the supermarket shelf.<br \/>The issues are price differentials and changes.  There are different prices for the same type of animal in the three jurisdictions.  That is a major concern because if the price is down across Europe and these islands, one can at least say the market is not good, but the difference seems to be becoming more acute. <br \/>The second issue is the changing specifications.  Two things are happening.  If one has in-spec cattle, there are more deductions and it is harder to get a premium price.  Many more cattle are being deemed to be out-of-spec and there is a huge clip in price.  This seems to lead to an issue about the power of beef processors.  Justin McCarthy wrote an editorial in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>last week about retailers being behind this ultimately and indicating that it was not just processors, that it also had a retail arm.  This is the issue with which we grappled for over a year - the power of the multiple.  We need to examine its power to work the market.  The hidden hand of the multiples might be involved in this issue. <br \/>Barriers to trade on this island and between Ireland and Britain seem to become more acute all the time.  Do we know the exact quantity of imported beef being processed in this country, particularly from Poland?  Do we know what happens to that beef, where it goes to from this country and under what label?  Is anybody tracking every piece coming in?  Last year we could not track horsemeat.  Do we know exactly what happens to all of that beef and what impact it has on the market?<br \/>There seems to be uncertainty and a lack of clarification about the four movement issue.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue last week and the reply on what was meant by the four movements was less than satisfactory.  Its sudden imposition seems to be causing problems for the way cattle farming is conducted.  It affects not only factory-ready cattle but also has a knock-on effect on selling calves.  One cannot sell a Holstein-Jersey cross cow.  One effectively gives it away because there is nobody to buy it as there is no live trade in calves out of the country and nobody wants them because of what has happened.<br \/>The response to date has been totally inadequate.  None of us, the Oireachtas, the Minister or even all of the organisations represented here, has got on top of this issue.  I have a few suggestions to make.  One of the best ways to concentrate the minds of those who might be manipulating the market in some way is to make it absolutely clear that the Government does not care whether it takes two years or ten, that it will pursue this issue and call for major structural changes over whatever length of time it takes to bring them about.  If one knows that it is determined and will go through fundamental change, that will concentrate the mind because they are thinking in the long as well as the short term because they have long-term investments. <br \/>Since last autumn I have been calling for an Irish inquiry, as well as an EU inquiry, into the operation of the free market.  I have issued several press releases on the issue.  If we were to put it on the national agenda, if the Minister were to say tomorrow that he would back such an inquiry, at home and abroad, that would begin to concentrate minds. <br \/>I was very taken by the phrase used to the effect that if there was anything worse than a State monopoly, it was a private one.  We know where there is over-concentration of ownership, whether it be in the media or elsewhere, that regulation clips in.<\/p> <p>We must look at the structures, given that so much of the industry is controlled in a small number of hands - in particular the offal market which is totally controlled - whether it is contrary to competition law, and what can be done in that regard.  I suggest we all agree, because there seems to be a delay in bringing forward the legislation, to introduce a groceries order on a legislative basis, with an ombudsman.  I understand the delay does not have to do with the consumer side but with the merger of the Competition Authority and the consumer authority.  I suggest we forget about the merger and get on with the groceries order in the meantime and that when the legal difficulties have been resolved, we can deal with the merger.<\/p><p> We could call for an immediate examination by the Data Protection Commission of access to the animal identification and movement, AIM, system and the computerised maintenance management system, CMMS, the information the factories have and whether it is contrary to data protection legislation.  It seems to be totally contrary to data protection legislation that they can find out how many cattle somebody has on a farm.  I have no doubt that the Data Protection Commissioner would be interested in the issue if there was any validity to breaches of data protection legislation in that regard.<\/p><p> I seek clarification on the issue of levies raised by the ICSA which has suggested what could be done without levies.  Currently, farmers are hugely affected and confidence in farming is affected.  Considerable financial pressure is being put on farmers and there are knock-on effects on sales and people investing in the main produce from dairy cows.  It is a major national issue.  As has been pointed out by the IFA, there are considerable national financial ramifications.  Would it be possible for all of the farming organisations to get together with politicians to draw up a common list of actions such as opening up the live trade and breaking down barriers to ensure free trade?  <\/p><p> The last straw for me was when people tried to divide the island.  We have a Department of agriculture in the North and in the South and I find it difficult to understand why the two Ministers cannot get together.  Both come from the Nationalist tradition and say partition of the island is not acceptable in the cattle trade and that we will not accept it.  Any artificial manipulation of trade between the North and the South would be contrary to everything for which we have worked politically and economically for 20 years under the Good Friday Agreement.  What we should do is break down the barriers and create a common market for Irish goods to put them on world markets, not create artificial differences that make it impossible for a farmer in County Monaghan to sell cattle into County Fermanagh or County Armagh.  That is utterly ridiculous and we need to take action on the issue.  Luckily for us, we have a colleague of Deputy Michael Colreavy in charge of the Department in the North.  I am sure she would be more than willing to meet our Minister and knock down barriers.  There is at least a sea between this country and Britain, although I do not agree with the difference in that regard either.  I fought against it for months.  It is an utter disgrace to have a barrier on the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400009#L00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393945200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400010#M00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1393945200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I will begin by apologising for Deputy Martin Ferris.

This is an issue of deep concern to him.<\/p><p>  I thank the four organisations for making their presentations.  This is an issue of which I am aware from talking to farmers and farming groups locally in the north west, but nonetheless the presentations were disturbing.  What we are looking at is a fundamentally flawed system.  I probably have more questions for the meat industry than the representative groups because I am aware of the concerns of farmers locally.  The industry has incredible power.  It would be akin to me being a producer of goods from which I would make a profit from their sale but where someone else had to grow the crop for me.  I could tell them what I needed &ndash; X, Y and Z - the quantity of product required and the price I would pay.  Then when the people producing the crop on my behalf had grown it and did not have an option to go elsewhere with it, I could say I did not really need X, Y and Z but A, B and C and that I would take X, Y and Z off their hands and would not pay for it.  Is that not a lovely position to be in?<\/p><p>  I should have conveyed my best wishes to Mr. Eddie Downey and Mr. Patrick Kent on taking up their very important jobs.  I am sure Deputy Martin Ferris would wish me to extend my best wishes to them.  <\/p><p>  What is wrong is that we have a deeply flawed system.  It smacks of the same phenomenon that we saw with the multinational supermarkets in that they go to growers and agree a price for vegetables, meat, milk or other product.  They have a captive audience which cannot go elsewhere and can pay what they want.  That is wrong.  I cannot understand why it is tolerated, as it damages the interests of farmers.  We have heard compelling evidence that this is the case.  It damages consumer and Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  How can we have any confidence that the targets set in Food Harvest 2020 will be achieved when there is uncertainty permeating the entire market?  What we have is a monopoly and there appears to be evidence of anti-competitive practices.  One could ask whether the fact that one has four factories means that one has competition by default.  No, it does not.  Is there a role for the Competition Authority or has it been asked to become involved?

It is something we should be able to sort out now.  I do not have questions because the delegates have painted a very bleak picture of what is happening in the country.  We need to sort out the matter very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400010#M00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1393945200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for the comprehensive presentations.  As someone who comes from the heart of the area where some of what is being spoken about is prevalent and relevant, I am acutely aware of the impact it is having.  It is not today or yesterday that I used to talk about this type of issue.  Mr. Spellman referred to feed lots.  I remember railing against the major processors engaging in the types of thing outlined and getting farm payments.<\/p> <p>They built up significant farm payments through this type of factory inspired approach, which is something I railed against at the time.<\/p><p> There appears to be a concerted practice of market manipulation involved and it is amazing this has escaped the supervisory tentacles of the various authorities involved.  The Competition Authority should surely have been aware of it.  One of the presentations suggested the EU Court of Auditors is very vigilant in terms of what we would consider minor errors, and that it comes down like a tonne of bricks on them.  I agree with Deputy Colreavy that it is time some of these bodies started to take a detailed look at this.  It has gone beyond time for this.<\/p><p> Everybody advocates a free market and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made a very good point about State monopolies.  The market monopolies are worse, because they race to the end line and do not mind who they trample on to achieve a result.  I agree with the suggestion it is time to appoint a well resourced regulator to deal with the meat processing industry once and for all, because there are two many tales about what is going on.  They cannot all be old wives tales.  These tales have not just come out now, they come from as far back as the 1970s.  I remember the old monetary compensatory amounts, MCA, system and there were all sorts of stories about it at the time.  Strangely, this now seems to be reproduced in a different format, but without that name being applied to it.<\/p><p> It is time for us to take a detailed look at the system and to put in place a system for all Irish food.  This may be an ambitious plan, but it is time it was done.  It is not good to allow the distortion of the market to continue beyond beef, facilitating the construction of barriers and impediments which are anti-competitive and contrary to EU policy, particularly in terms of the free movement of goods.  That they can do this in the middle of the production season, when people cannot alter their behaviour over night, is serious cause for concern.  I was interested to hear that the rules on the quality bonus scheme were rewritten in the middle of the game.  This is tantamount to market manipulation also.  I may have misinterpreted the detailed and excellent submissions, but some of the remarks made seem to point to some form of collusion between the larger multiples and the major processors.  Do any of the witnesses feel this may be happening?  Are the heavy hands of both intertwined behind their backs, unseen, unheard and unspoken, but delivering?<\/p><p>  I have one other question on the issue of the factories.  When talking about beef, we talk about four quarters, but there is now a fifth area and there is some money hanging around, for the hide, the tongue and various bits.  Beef was probably never as profitable as it is now.  Years ago, this area was a great excuse for the price of cattle not being as attractive as we all thought it should be.  Is there any sign of any of that money coming back or is it being confiscated and put into the soup?  Is it going one way, into the bottom lines for the factories?  It is time we had an in-depth look at this situation.  Many farmers are teetering on the brink, but factories have never been as well off.  This is a clear contradiction that cannot be tolerated for much longer.  I will support anything this committee can do to bring this issue to the fore.  It is time there was a Government initiative in this regard.  It is time to step onto the pitch and bring this issue to the fore at national and European level.  Let us walk, rather than talk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400010#M00400","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393945800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I would like to congratulate the two new presidents and wish them well in their terms of office.  I look forward to working with them over that time.<\/p><p>  We are all at one here on this issue.  Everybody is probably waiting anxiously for the next section of this meeting.  The point has been made that the goal posts have been changed regularly, but this is not a new phenomenon.  This situation has arisen many times.  We get two or three good years, but then we hit a bad year and then have two or three bad years and so on.  We need a short-term solution now, but we need a long-term solution for the future.  Farmers and producers need certainty from year to year, rather having to rely on what may happen.  We need engagement on this.<\/p><p>  This committee did significant work with the grocery area where legislation is overdue and needs to be moved on urgently.  We did some very good work in that regard last year.  I am aware it is not on our work schedule, but perhaps we should use the committee in the same way  to do an in-depth investigation on the meat industry.  There is scope for the committee to do this and I believe the appetite for that exists now.  We should bring in all the stakeholders.  Having listened to the presentations here today, I have been reinforced in my opinion that the large multiples have a significant role to play in this also.<\/p><p>  I compliment all those who made presentations on their presentations, in particular the ICOS presentation which lays out the bare facts of the current position for everybody to see.  A concern brought to my attention in the past week was raised in one of the presentations, namely, who has access to the AIM system within the factories.  This is a serious issue.  If somebody had access to some of our personal details, there would be uproar.  This is something that needs to be investigated.  I would support Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's suggestion to bring in the data protection officer or whoever is in charge to the committee.<\/p><p>  This is a serious matter.  Who controls access and who should have access to the system?  Is access restricted to a certain number of people?  I believe it is restricted to a certain number of people and those people are the only ones who should have access to it, but I understand that almost everybody within the factory system has access to it and is able to manipulate the figures and know from day to day and week to week what is and should be coming in and can organise prices accordingly.  This is a serious matter that should be investigated.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier, the goal posts have been changed.  The factories, Bord Bia and everybody else gave great encouragement to farmers to produce a certain type of beef, but now they have rowed back on that.  Why has the position changed?  I know there are more steer coming into the market.  I see a big problem arising if we have a 50% increase in dairy production, starting next year.  This is a concern.  We are only a little over a year away from the abolition of quotas, which means we will see more Friesian type cattle coming into the market.  This will cause a serious problem.  Where are these cattle going to go?  This brings me back to the point I made initially.  We need a long-term solution to this problem.  We must try to iron it out once and for all so as to introduce certainty.<\/p><p>  The lack of competition is a serious issue.  We have had one dominant player in the market place for many years and it seems to be getting more dominant as we move on.  There also seems to be a connection developing between that dominant player and the large multiples.  This requires a serious investigation.  I do not have many questions, but I would like to know more about who should have access to the AIM system.  What information do the witnesses have on that?  Who has access to it and who should have the information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400011#N00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1393945800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their detailed presentations.  I will not rehash what has been said because we have a lot to get through.  I will just make a few points and put my question.  I concur with everything Deputy Deering has said and agree we need both a short-term and long-term solution.  The consumer protection and competition Bill will be a key component for that solution, as will be addressing the relationship between the producer, the processor and the retailer.<\/p><p>  Coming from a farming background, I would have a negative enough view of the factories.  When this committee did its work on the grocery order and reported on it, we saw there was pressure on farmers and middle producers from the multiples also.<\/p> <p>There is a problem in trying to force people to buy a product for which they do not have a market but the issue is much wider than that.  The phrase \"market manipulation\" has been used many times today and that should prompt everyone to sit up and listen.  In particular, the presentation from ICOS which made cost comparisons between the UK and Ireland was telling.  <\/p><p>  Reference was made to different jurisdictions and the rules that apply to different areas.  In that context I am reminded of the story told by my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, from Donegal, about the pig farmers in Donegal whose animals are inspected by departmental inspectors and then, when they cross the Border to Foyle Meats, they have to be checked again.  There is much overlap and duplication of effort in that regard.  I ask the witnesses to give their views on the potential for an all-island approach to such matters.  Would that be helpful?

I was an active bull beef producer until this year and I do not know what divine inspiration prompted me to decide not to produce it this year.  I still have a problem trying to get rid of steer beef.  Mr. Spellman summed up the situation well when he referred to the cuts in the price paid to farmers by Tesco in the UK which is still charging the same price to its customers.  That clearly explains the pressures being felt by those in the beef industry in this country.  Can the panel outline when the 16-month condition came into effect and why that was driven by the meat factories.  Regarding the overweight condition, it used to drive me demented when I would kill a lamb, discover it was 2 kg overweight and then not get paid for it.  Are we going to see the same happening with beef?  Will those farmers with carcasses over 400 kg be penalised?  When was this condition introduced and how was it allowed by the farmers' representative organisations?

Let us look back to where we were this time last year.  We had the horsemeat crisis which was not caused by the farmers, who did their job right.  A whole raft of new specifications have been introduced because of the bad behaviour of various people and the farmers are being forced to pay for that.  The Minister and others had to do a lot of work last year in order to keep those guys in business and this is the payback for the farmers.<\/p><p>  On the weight issue, the bottom line is very simple.  The meat factories got us into the numbers game, created the confidence in keeping those numbers and now they are starting to do whatever they want to do.  We have met them and tried to alter their approach to this but were not successful.  The Minister brought them into a meeting with us, at our request, but two days later some of them tried to lower the weight limit.  We are saying clearly here that we need help with this.  As farm organisations, we are not able to sort this out on our own.  We are putting our hands up and admitting that we need help.  There are 100,000 livestock farmers in this country.  The industry is worth &euro;2 billion in exports but it is under threat at the moment.  It is in danger of going more and more into the hands of the factories.  The factories are buying cattle themselves.  They are putting calves on farms.  They are working towards owning the cattle industry as well as the meat industry.  All of the main players in the meat industry here have invested heavily in Europe and the UK on the back of the profits they are dragging out of Ireland.  The Irish-owned meat industry is the only one in Europe that is able to re-invest its profits.  This is a huge issue for farmers.<\/p><p>  On the issue of live exports, we put six to eight months of work into getting a link into England from Rosslare with Stena Lines, which is now in place.  That needs to be utilised fully which means greater numbers of cattle.  In that context, we need the help of the State agencies such as Bord Bia, as well as the assistance of the Minister.  We need to take a shortcut on this.  There are farmers out there today who are bleeding serious money.  I have gone into the banks with a number of farmers at this stage in an effort to get the banks to hold off.  That is the situation farmers find themselves in - their backs are to the wall as we speak.  We do not have time on our side.  We need intervention from the Minister now.  We need to see that he is on the side of the farmers on this.  There are 100,000 livestock farmers in this country, big and small and the small ones are as much affected by this as the larger guys, even if they do not finish animals.  The man that used to buy from the small guy does not have the money any more.  We need direct intervention now.  The meat industry was at the table during the Harvest 2020 discussions with the Department and was an enthusiastic supporter.  We have heard all about the new markets but delivery at farm level is down by about 50 cent per kilo.  We need to go the direct route and the Department has the solution to many of our problems.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400012#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Henry Burns"},{"type":"speech","time":1393946400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Chairman, on a point of information, if the information is available from the Department's site to meat factories, then the Department is in breach of the data protection rules, not the meat factories.

There is no problem with this for Italian consumers because it is applied properly in an open European Single Market.  Why can we not do the same in the UK?  That is the issue the Minister must address.  Artificial blockages to that market have been put in place.  It is not about whether we have an all-Ireland policy or agreements with France or Belgium.

That is a sad statement when one thinks about it.  It is unbelievable that we have a problem of getting rid of quality Irish beef, the best in the world.  I accept the factories have high numbers of animals coming at them while we are asking them to take the cattle.  That gives them power, however.  As we know, absolute power corrupts.<\/p><p>  There is corruption in the system.  The processors and the retailers are in collusion.  Everyone knows this.  They will talk about fair trade and the manner in which they have to do it.  The problem is that the high numbers of cattle have left the factories with power to put pressure on farmers over prices.  However, it has left the retailer with more power against the factories.  This is where the pressure is coming from and it is a weakness in the system.  Unless legislation is introduced to protect all the players in the system, we are going nowhere.  That includes the producer, the processor, the distributor, the retailer and the customer.  The chains in the link need to be of equal power.<\/p><p>  The Competition Authority was asked to look into the beef industry.  It did but found nothing wrong and the fact the price is exactly the same from all the factories around the country is a pure coincidence.  No one believes that.

Members have copies of my presentation.  Given the time, I will try to proceed through it as quickly as possible, but I would like to cover it all.  I will look at where we are now, the performance of the industry over recent years, the market situation, market specifications - particularly the young bull issue, which has already been discussed here - some of the real threats and challenges facing the sector, about which we need to talk, and some conclusions.<\/p><p>  There has been much talk about Food Harvest 2020.  We firmly believe much has been done in moving towards achieving those targets.  As Mr. Fitzgerald said, finished cattle prices in Ireland have increased by approximately 40% over the last four years.  That is a significant delivery on price from the market.  Cumulatively, it is worth an additional &euro;1.5 billion to Irish beef finishers over the last number of years.  Today, despite weakening in the market due to market conditions, overall prices in Ireland remain over the European average price.  When one takes all categories, including steers, heifers, cows and young bulls, and the mix of slaughters, we are at approximately 107% of the European average price.<\/p> <p>We have the third highest steer and cow prices in Europe and we are at the top end of the price table.  The heifer price in Ireland is fifth highest in Europe.  As Mr. Fitzgerald stated, our exports last year topped &euro;2.1 billion, which represents a 35% increase in export values since 2010 in year-on-year growth.  Another important parameter is that we have built and expanded the quality assurance scheme to a stage at which it now covers 87% of all animals slaughtered.<br \/>We are in a good and strong position.  There are issues, which I will deal with later, but overall this is a business in the economy which has functioned well in recent years.  The graph on this slide shows exports, and I do not need to dwell on it because I have spoken about them.  Ireland exports 90% of what the beef sector produces.  Our export dependency is a far different dynamic from any other beef market in Europe and poses a challenge in terms of delivering on price, as we do not have a substantial domestic market to underpin prices.<br \/>It is important that we set out again the performance in recent years.  The industry has achieved much in the past decade.  Irish beef is now listed with more retail chains than beef of any other origin in the world.  This is stated by Bord Bia and is delivered by an industry that has invested heavily in marketing, feet on the streets, doing business with retail chains and delivering the business.  The sector has developed into a fresh chilled supplier of beef throughout the European market, which has taken a significant amount of investment.  It involves a significant number of jobs in the Irish economy.<br \/>The graph on this slide shows the continuous growth in sale penetration to retail chains throughout Europe over the past decade.  This has been happening since early 2000 and has meant a continuous increase in price over the past decade.  There were ups and downs along the way.  At one point in 2005 and 2006, imported meat from South America had a significant impact on the market.  There was also a major sterling shock to the system, which affected many aspects of the economy, but the overall Irish food economy was affected by its heavy reliance on the UK market.  The sector has delivered on price and in the past three or four years the price has gone from &euro;3 per kilo to &euro;4 per kilo.  This Bord Bia graph shows a stepped movement of prices on a continuous upward trend in recent years.<br \/>That said, prices have weakened since Christmas, and we need to examine the reasons behind this.  I hope committee members have a copy of my presentation document because the text on the slides is small from this distance.  I will run through some of the key factors at play in the European beef marketplace.  In recent years, consumption has been under pressure throughout Europe and in some of the key markets.  We must remember that in many of the markets we serve there is still an economic downturn, and economic crisis is not just an Irish phenomenon.  This has had an impact on consumer spending decisions.<br \/>In recent weeks there has been little promotional activity in beef retail because of its relative price versus other meats.  The manufacturing beef trade throughout Europe continues to be quite weak.  The committee may not be familiar with the fact that for the past six weeks no pork or pigmeat has been exported from Europe to Russia because of a ban imposed on 26 January.  We are starting to see greater volumes of pigmeat in the European market because of this overnight ban and restriction on exports to Russia.  This means beef processing companies have rising stock levels.  The processing of cattle on a weekly basis does not result in all of the product moving, because of these difficulties in the marketplace.  That said, Irish cattle slaughtering has increased by approximately 7% in the year to date.  Last year European production declined but this year it has increased.  This does not just affect Ireland; information from the UK beef marketing organisation shows a continuous decline in UK cattle prices in October.<br \/>The next slide shows the production levels and forecasts for beef throughout Europe.  Last year beef production declined by just over 2% in Europe, which was a help in the overall market as there was less beef in the system.  A 1.1% increase is forecast in beef this year in the European market.  As I stated, the economic crisis has had an impact on consumption in many member states.  After a significant fall last year a stabilisation in consumption has been forecast.  I will go through some of the individual markets which are important to us.  In 2013, consumption at retail level in the Irish market fell by 5%; the British market decreased by 3%; the French market decreased by 4%; the German market decreased by 1.5%; the Spanish market decreased by 4%; and the Italian market decreased by almost 4%.  This is the reality of retail beef sales.  Since Christmas there has been significant pressure on consumption levels.<br \/>The next slide shows the UK retail market.  The overall volume of sales decreased by approximately 3% last year.  This varied across the various categories of meat.  The next slide shows information from the beef marketing agency in the UK on mince sales.  More than 50% of beef sold at retail in the UK is in mince form.  The graph shows a decline in consumption up to January.  A comment published in the UK <i>Farmers Weekly<\/i>at the end of February stated that low consumer demand for beef was holding back the market, as rising beef prices in recent years had turned some people to other meats.  This is a factor in what is happening in the marketplace.  As Mr. Fitzgerald stated, the Irish industry has delivered price increases.  This graph shows an Irish steer price versus the continental price.  It excludes the British price, but this information is in the documentation provided to committee members.  The UK price is above the Irish price and the Irish price is above European prices.  As I stated earlier, we export 90% of the beef we produce.<br \/>There has been considerable talk about market specification in recent weeks.  Steer heifer grass-fed beef is our unique selling point.  It is what our largest market, the UK, requires and what gives us our point of difference in European markets.  This has been the clear message not only from the industry but from consumers and our key customers throughout Europe.<\/p> <p>These issues were highlighted in the Food Harvest 2020 report and the subsequent report of the beef activation group.  It was clearly stated in these reports that the industry saw itself developing and moving forward on the basis of steer heifer beef and comments to the effect that the industry has driven a bull beef production system in Ireland are inaccurate.<br \/>After the publication of the Food Harvest 2020 report, the industry introduced a quality payments system, about which we talked to the committee several years ago.  It is a system that offers bonuses and tries to reward quality beef production from the suckler herd.  At the time, an in-spec bonus was introduced, which was increased last year, ultimately to drive a focus on specification and producer take-up of the quality assurance scheme which the marketplace was demanding.<br \/>The UK specification at retail level for young bulls is less than 16 months.  That is the requirement.  There are limited opportunities to engage in young bull production above that age for supply to certain customers in the European market.  It is processor-specific, depending on their customer portfolio.  Therefore, our consistent message on bull beef production has been and continues to be that if producing outside the generic specification, one must do so in conjunction with a processor.  That has always been the case and many producers are doing this successfully.<br \/>The final point on specification is that the industry will publish in the near future further confirmation of what it believes is the best way forward for the beef sector.  Delivery on price, securing retail markets and the achievement of a premium in the European market for Irish beef will not be achieved unless we deliver what the consumer requires.  We intend to publish further clarification about what the specifications are, but they do not include anything that is significantly different from what has been said.  <br \/>With regard to young bulls, the industry met the new IFA president and his team at the end of January and we discussed issues that were of concern at the time.  One of the main issues was young bulls and young bull slaughterings, on which the industry has responded.  The young bull kill has increased from 4,000 head per week in the early weeks of January to 5,500 and in the past four weeks to 6,500.  Last week there were 18% more young bulls killed than in the same week last year.  The industry has responded to the calls from farm leaders and subsequent to our meeting with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.<br \/>Obviously, there are concerns about current market challenges.  That is understandable and accepted, but we must base them on what is happening and also be cognisant that there has been a very good performance.  However, there are challenges and threats to the sector, to which we hope the committee will turn its attention very soon, as it has done in the past.  The key one is the ongoing discussions at EU level on bilateral trade deals.  They include the trade deal concluded with Canada at the end of last year, although there are outstanding issues and we are working with the Department and our European colleagues to try to address them.  There is an ongoing discussion with the United States and there is talk that the Mercosur talks will be back on track.  All of these present a significant threat and the farm organisations will have referred to them also.  They present a real threat because of the potential for significant volumes of beef to come onto the market at considerably lower prices than European prices.  We have spoken to the committee previously about that issue, but we believe our attention must be focused on it at present because there are many movements in that regard.<br \/>The other challenge we would highlight is the continual drive for on-farm efficiency.  The industry has delivered and will stand by its record in delivering on price.  It has had to meet very significant challenges.  I referred to the sterling crisis, in which the currency changed against us by 30%.  The industry has had to take serious measures in terms of its efficiency in processing and the delivery of product to the market and there is still more ground to be made up at farm level.  The industry has been involved in work with Teagasc and other organisations, including the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, to examine what can be achieved from beef enterprises.  Some very good results have been achieved, including some significant gross margins per hectare, through a focus on output, costs and grass utilisation, on which more progress can be made.<br \/>Overall, the beef processing industry has delivered strongly on marketing and marketing performance in the past decade.  It has transformed from a frozen commodity business to a fresh chill business and delivered on price.  The price has moved from approximately &euro;2.30 per kg at the beginning of the decade to &euro;4 per kg now; therefore, it is undeniable that there has been delivery on price.  There is a weakening in the market, but that is due to market conditions which are largely driven by weaker demand.  In-spec and producing animals to specification are essential and will be the single way to deliver the best returns.  The industry has responded to concerns raised about the backlog in the processing of young bulls and acted on them.  Given the platform that has been built and the penetration of Irish beef across UK and European markets and, I hope, in ensuring no significantly damaging trade deals are made, the future is positive and the industry and the sector will deliver on their Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We also welcome the fact that the Minister has announced a genomics programme with support targeted towards the beef suckler herd and that matters regarding the CAP have been concluded.  The industry would also state it has delivered in terms of a cumulative figure of &euro;1.5 billion for beef producers in recent years in higher prices.  Working from this, there is a positive future, although we must be conscious of the threats in respect of trade deals and the challenges in terms of on-farm productivity levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400014#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393948500,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the presentation, but I looked at it before I left.  Unfortunately, I had another appointment.<\/p><p>  While a great deal of information has been given, the delegates should look at the big picture.  The big picture is that one group, the beef factories, keep making a comparison with EU prices, when the nearest and biggest single market for our beef is Britain.  If prices were flat across Europe, it would be understandable that they would be flat here.  However, in a free open market where, according to EU rules, everybody can sell equally where he or she wishes and what he or she wishes, the yardstick must be the British price.  Nothing that has been said deals with that question.<\/p><p>  In the past few months it appears that more barriers have been erected to trade.  There should be a situation where one can sell wherever one wishes but, for some remarkable reason, it appears to be very difficult to get live cattle into Britain.  However, as ICOS proved, the price of Irish beef on supermarket shelves in Britain is the same as that of British beef.  There appear to be many new difficulties in obtaining proper prices for Irish cattle in the North of Ireland.  They appear to be becoming nomads in their own land.  I might be a simple guy, but as far as I am concerned, an animal born, bred, reared and slaughtered on the island of Ireland is Irish.  It is extraordinary that free trade is not only breaking down across the European Union but also on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  I have a number of questions.  First, what changes have been made to the carcase specifications and what was the reason for making them?<\/p> <p>When did labelling changes across the Border come into effect?  What was the level of price drop for finishers when one compares January and February 2014 figures with the same period in 2013, after the average price with all of the discounts, out-of-spec reductions, etc., have been taken into account?  I do not want the premium versus premium figure only to learn that a lot of cattle that would have made premium last year did not meet premium this year.  I seek the average prices.<\/p><p> I am particularly interested in Polish beef.  How much Polish beef has been imported for further processing in Irish factories here?  Where has it been sold?  Under what brand is it being sold?  What arrangements are in place or what checks are carried out by the food authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that there is transparency in the transmission of the beef to the final market and to ensure we do not have another horsemeat issue, where we do not know what came in or where it came from and where it went to?  <\/p><p> I have another relevant question.  How many cattle are being fattened by farmers on contract for the meat plants?  Meat plants are contracting farmers to fatten cattle for them more often, and I am curious to know the figure.  How many cattle are involved at any one time?  What is the peak number of cattle that the meat plants have had fattened on contract?  The factories own the cattle and can decide whether to bring them in as they see fit.  <\/p><p> There seems to be a total lack of communication in the beef industry.  I have been told by a lot of farmers and people who work with the agri-industry who have no personal involvement in farming that farmers have been encouraged by Teagasc and other groups to produce bull beef, that they were not told that it all had to be under 16 months of age and that they took the advice.  Perhaps I misunderstood the witnesses, but I got the very clear impression that they said MII had, for some considerable time and way beyond the cycle that we are talking about, advised against the production of bull beef and said that people should produce steer beef.  Can the delegation outline whether it gave that advice or whether Teagasc was privy to that advice?  If we have a disjointed industry in which factories need one thing and the main advisory service that people look to for advice advises a totally different thing, then it is time we got communications together in the industry.  I would be very surprised if Teagasc had been advised by the factories and encouraged the production of the wrong type of animal.  I would be surprised if it took the risk of encouraging farmers to produce the wrong type of beef for the factories.  <\/p><p> I have two final questions.  Has there been much of a tightening up in supervision and the transmission of goods within the meat processing industry since the horsemeat scandal last year?  Has it in any way contributed to what was in-spec last year suddenly becoming out-of-spec this year, because there is much more rigid control of the animals going through and much better labelling and because now an item must be called whatever it really is?  People have said that the huge extra controls are a bit like the land parcel identification system for farmers.  In other words, it is a lot more accurate this year than it was last year.  Has this been a contributing factor in what has happened to the factories?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400016#S00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393949100,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.  Deputy Martin Ferris normally sits on the committee but he cannot be with us today and apologises  for his absence.  He asked me to substitute for him today.  I know that he is deeply concerned about this issue.<\/p><p>  Where do I begin?  The meat industry exists to make a profit for shareholders, and there is nothing wrong with that provided it is done fairly, within the accepted laws of commerce and principles of good faith.  I know from talking to farmers in my area of the north west that they feel that factories have a monopoly.  They encouraged them to produce a particular product at a point in time but then said they no longer wanted that precise product but agreed to take it off their hands at a cheaper price because they wanted something different.  Those farmers have been put to the pin of their collar, and in some cases beyond that, to sustain their farming activities because what they had planned to earn in income from the factories has not been delivered.  They feel let down and cheated by the factories.  They regard the choices and decisions made by the factories as price control mechanisms created to get a product more cheaply from those producers.  The farmers feel they are a captive audience, because they produced what the factories said was going to be needed but have now been told it is no longer needed and that the product will be taken off their hands as a favour but at greatly reduced prices.  They feel cheated.  <\/p><p>  The fundamental problem is that we have a virtually unregulated business scenario in which the law of a monopoly operates.  I would like the delegation to convince me that my understanding is flawed.  I believe the system is flawed and that there are not enough controls in place.  I believe that the producers - the farmers - cannot have certainty to plan for the future in the present environment.  I ask the delegation to convince me that my understanding is flawed, if it is so.<\/p><p>  I also have a few specific questions, as it is useful to get information in this regard.  I do not underestimate the challenge facing those the witnesses represent.  Can they describe what connections its members have with factories in Northern Ireland, Britain and the EU?  Can it describe the process used to create a specification?  One of the complaints we have received is that a specification can be agreed but then changed.  Is there a time limit for specifications?  Is there a plan B for specifications?  Is the meat industry the ultimate designer of specifications?  <\/p><p>  I was impressed by the statistic quoted by the delegation that the number of retailers listed has increased from 27 in 2001 to more than 75 in 2014.  How does the industry negotiate the listings with retailers?<\/p> <p>Does the industry understand the reason the primary producers, the farmers, need certainty in terms of planning for stocks, stock levels and stock types for a medium term future?  If it accepts that they need that certainly can the industry suggest ways where that certainty could be made a partnership approach between the industry and the primary producers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400017#T00200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393949700,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Colreavy and call Senator Comiskey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400018#U00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1393949700,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for its presentation.  One the face of it one would almost imagine there was no problem, yet a number of farmers are protesting up the street today.  At our meetings with farmers in the past month or six weeks there has been anger at the way they have been treated, particularly the bull beef producers.  They are suffering serious cuts and in some cases do not even get their animals slaughtered.  That is the reason we are here and the reason we are asking all the questions.  What is wrong with our neighbour, Britain, where we sent all our all our cattle in the past, as we do not appear to get a fair deal there?  The lesson to be learned is that we must have live exports.  We just cannot depend on the factories in Ireland, for whom the product is produced, and have to take a serious cut.<\/p><p>  A question that has already been asked is how much beef is being imported.  We hear stories about beef being imported and being held in storage.  When needed it is taken out and depresses the market further.  In the past couple of years when Ireland was in recession, the farmers were the people who were taking us out of it and getting the country back on its feet.  Of all the jobs created, some 26,000 were in the agriculture sector, some of which would be in the meat and food industry.  That is good and we all subscribe to that and push for its continuance.  However, it is not fair that everybody along the line gets paid and the farmer takes what is left.  What is the outlook for farmers?  We do not want to continue to produce stock for which there is a bad price.  What is the outlook for them into the future?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400018#U00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1393949700,"counter":65,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400018#U00400","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393949700,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will take the issue of price in general and the comments made by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others and what is the proper price barometer.  In the past ten years, and particularly in the past five, prices have increased by 40%.  From a European perspective, from about the mid-1980s to 2005, we were getting about 90% of the average EU price for our beef.  That was our price and that was the European price.  This transition and transformation in the past five years has delivered a situation where we are now at around 100% of the EU average but, for large periods of last year, we well above that level.  That is the first point.  The delivery piece has been quite exceptional and has been delivered not just by a rising tide but by increased investment and value added.<\/p><p>  In terms of the other piece of that and how one makes comparisons, this industry has transformed dramatically.  We sell cuts of beef.  We do not sell carcases or live animals.  Therefore, to take any particular live animal price in a market and try to reassemble that back to what should have happened and what is the best barometer of that price for a live animal in an Irish factory is just not comparing the same thing.  The barometer that is most used - we hear much about it when it suits - is the R3 UK price which is for an animal that is UK based and gets a red tractor certification for it.  We do not produce or sell that animal.  We sell boneless beef cuts right across the EU.  We export 0.5 billion tonnes of beef per year to the European market, 50% of that goes to the rest of the European Union and 50% goes to the UK.  Clearly, in that marketing mix, one is trying to get the best price right across for all cuts.  That is how one gets to the price recovery we are talking about.<\/p><p>  In terms of barometers, while going back ten or 20 years one can pick a particular live animal price on the market and say we should aspire to that, we do not sell live animals any more.  We do not sell animals that have red tractor certifications attached to them; we are selling boneless beef.  All of that being said, the price recovery here has been quite exceptional, it has been strongly delivered by an investment in the selling of fresh beef from Ireland.  The reason we get into markets is not just because there are broad supply and demand conditions, it is because hard work is done by Irish processors to secure supermarket contracts and contracts with companies such as McDonalds and others.  That is the reason we have the profile for our beef sales.  In response to this price comparison piece, one needs to look at what the industry here is selling and any of the barometers one might choose to use.  Mr. Cormac Healy might deal with some of the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400018#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393949700,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Chairman, if it is all right I will touch on some of the issues. The information published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia shows that the price in Ireland today is still at the upper end of European prices.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the comparison with the UK.  The chairman, Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald, has said we are selling cuts.  Some 50% of our overall beef, not the full carcase of an animal, goes to the UK; there is mix right across Europe.  We are very lucky to have the UK market, which is the world's highest beef price market, on our doorstep.  Obviously, the industry has focused significantly on it, in terms of marketing Irish beef and Bord Bia has focused its resources significantly on the UK market. There is no question but that it is a huge and invaluable part of the overall mix, but it is 50% of the mix and the other parts of the animal, the other cuts, are going across all markets and, therefore, it is relevant.  We are exporters on the edge of Europe into the European market and we are performing well beyond many other beef markets because we are exporting 90% of what we produce.<\/p><p>  Clearly, if one goes to markets such as the UK which has a self-sufficiency rate of 70%, or Italy at 50%, or France or Germany, they have major domestic beef production that is achieving their premium price in their markets.<\/p><p>  I was asked the price fall since January.  The report on prices is published each week by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The price for R grade steers was about &euro;4 per kg or &euro;5 kg in the first week of the year.  The last published price from the Department - not for last week - was &euro;4 per kg.  They have come a little, but that is a 5 cent to 6 cent fall.  The Deputy asked for prices that include everything, \"in spec\", \"out of spec\".  Those are the reported prices.  We are happy to provide any of those to the committee in correspondence.  They are published and are available. <\/p><p>  The issue of specifications was raised in a number of questions.  The industry has not been out there encouraging bull production.  The Food Harvest 2020 report and the beef activation report - we are happy to provide those reports but I am aware the committee dealt with them in great detail at the time - clearly point out that the view of the industry and, I am sure the view of Bord Bia if asked to present to the committee, has been that steer heifer grass-fed beef is the direction for the Irish beef sector.  It has been the mainstay of its progress in European markets and will be for the future.  In regard to bull production, recognising that farmers were moving in that direction to some extent, looking for the obvious efficiencies that go along with it, and also recognising the fact that we are going to have an increasing dairy herd in the country, it was clearly stated that this should be done in conjunction with processors.<\/p> <p>Much as people might like to talk about angst or mistrust, producers are working with processors in great numbers.  They are producing either bull beef to a particular specification or producing beef under various other schemes, depending on the breed of the animal and other factors.  There is significant work, co-operation and co-ordination between producers on the ground and their local factories.  The advice on bull production has always been that if producing outside the under-16 month age guideline, which reflects the retail specification in our largest market for beef, the United Kingdom, production should be carried out in conjunction with the processor.  This must be achieved at an early stage, not a month before the animals need to be slaughtered.  Some companies have worked more on bull beef sales because they have particular customers on the Continent.  They engage from the very earliest days with producers.  They advise them on nutrition and the production system, and they schedule in producers.  There is no question about clarifying that.<\/p><p> Specifications are ultimately derived from what the consumer requires and from what retailers require in terms of delivery to consumers.  Much of this relates to the size of a steak cut, for example.  If the retailer wants a trade involving two strip loins or fillets of a particular weight and at a particular price point, that is what is required.  A strip loin that is too big must be cut too thinly to make the weight and therefore it is not what anyone particularly wants.  The demand is ultimately derived from what retailers require, although there is some variation.  What we have sought to do regarding in-spec and setting out the details is describe the types of animals that will meet the requirements of the vast majority of customers.  This is because those are the animals that will ultimately secure the greatest return.<\/p><p> I was asked what we can do in future.  Deputy Colreavy asked about what we can do to improve in this regard.  There is no question but that there is always room for improvement.  Over recent years, the beef technology adoption programmes have been progressing.  They are funded by the Department.  Farmers, with advice from Teagasc or private sources, are attending discussion groups focusing on what they are producing, costs, etc.  We have tried to feed into these and engage with those involved.  On many occasions, the groups visit factories to examine the process.  Around the time of the quality payment system, QPS, we engaged very much in demonstrating what occurs when one breaks up an animal.  In fairness, although the producer supplies an animal to the factory, it is sold in the form of a vast array of cuts.  We can and continue to demonstrate the process.  Equally, the industry is committed to setting out what it believes to be the specification that will meet the vast majority of customer requirements across the United Kingdom and European markets and that will, as a consequence, have the best chance of delivering on price.<\/p><p> There have been no particular labelling changes.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned that an animal born, reared and slaughtered on the island of Ireland is Irish.  Unfortunately, if it is slaughtered in Northern Ireland, it is slaughtered in the United Kingdom according to EU regulations, and this must go on the label.  We did not make the rules; they are European regulations.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to the live export trade.  It is part of the overall sector.  We represent an industry that has invested in infrastructure, sales and marketing teams, people and jobs in this country, and we make no apology for saying that.  We want to see cattle that are born and reared in Ireland processed here and brought to the adult stage with full added value, thus supporting fully Irish jobs and the economy.  Live exports can operate, and if they operate on a fair playing pitch that is fine.  However, we are not going to engage in a discussion on whether one should promote live exports.  Over the past five years, live exportation has not been a driver of the progress in the sector.  Therefore, it has the role it has, but it is not something from an industry that wants to see investment in infrastructure and jobs on the ground.  We do not believe it is the future for Ireland.  The future for Ireland must be in adding value in food production and producing shelf-ready products, rather than exporting produce before it has achieved its full potential.  That is a general view on the matter.  There are those whose jobs rely on this.<\/p><p> I may not have hit on some points but I will revert to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400018#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393950300,"counter":69,"content":"<p>We can return to them if issues arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400019#V00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1393950300,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I wish to tease out a little more the change of specifications and the moving of the goalposts.  When exactly did the meat industry start communicating to farmers their limited options for beef over 16 months?  The IFA said in its presentation that in 2011 the factories strongly encouraged farmers not to export their dairy calves and keep them for bull beef.  Much of the difficulty with what Mr. Healy said today is that the current crisis and difficulties seem to have arisen out of the blue all of a sudden.  One could nearly pinpoint their arising to a date in late December.  Mr. Healy would have us believe the difficulties slowly crept up on us and that he has been saying for a very long time that farmers should be careful in this regard.  The problem seems to have hit farmers all of a sudden.<\/p><p>  More than one contributor referred to suspected market manipulation.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned ICOS representatives' recent visit to England.  Let me tease this out a little more.  I accept the point that 50% of the cuts go to the United Kingdom.  ICOS representatives found Irish beef and British beef sold at the same price per kilogram in Tesco stores.  Two identical cuts of brisket beef that were photographed, one labelled \"Irish\" and the other labelled \"British\", were both priced at &pound;8 per kilogram.  Therefore, the Irish farmer is receiving 15% to 20% less per kilogram.  Where does the margin go?  Can we take it that if the meat industry is not taking it, the multiples are doing so?  Can we join the dots in this regard?<\/p><p>  Overall, how much did the horsemeat scandal cost the industry last year?  Many farmers are telling me that it is a case of the meat industry trying to make the money back and that farmers are ultimately paying for the scandal.  Could Mr. Healy comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400019#V00300","speaker":"949"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1393950300,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Deputy Andrew Doyle resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1393950300,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I would like to refer to page 12 of Mr. Healy's presentation, which mentions cattle prices in Great Britain.

The figure of 320 for bull beef in England appears as if it is &euro;320, which is less than &pound;320.  This should be changed before the information goes on the record.<\/p><p>  Does the meat industry realise why there were thousands of farmers marching today?  The industry is in crisis and there is no denying that at present.  Farmers cannot get cattle killed.  Mr. Healy is stating the kill of bull beef has increased to 6,000.  One must remember, however, that the farmers have been waiting months to kill the animals.  The problem is that the animals are now over the stipulated age and the farmers are receiving a depressed price for them.<\/p> <p>If something comes out of this meeting today that can improve the lot of the primary producer, I will welcome it, but given what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised and what ICOS and Deputy Heydon have mentioned, that the cut for which the farmer in Ireland is getting 20% less is still being sold in an English supermarket at the same price, the MII, as an organisation, will be accused of being in collusion with the large multiples.<\/p><p> On producing statistics, the MII states that we are the third highest for steer beef and heifer beef and the fifth highest for cow beef, or, maybe, I have it the other way around.  If one takes the price of beef in the main markets in Europe, those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the average price per kilo is &euro;4.26.  The graph in the MII's presentation shows figures from countries such as Poland, Romania and all the other new EU states which do not provide the traceability that Irish farmers provide.  Irish farmers are producing a quality product that can be traced and that we can stand over on any world market and I do not agree with the MII assertion that our price is above the EU average.  The EU average price that the MII is producing is from lower grade countries in terms of traceability and production.  We have the highest quality animals in this country and yet our market is being depressed.<\/p><p> I do not accept their point that the Meat Industry Ireland did not encourage farmers to produce bull beef.  I attended open meetings, meetings with factories and meetings with Teagasc where farmers, especially dairy farmers, were encouraged to produce bull beef, that this was where it was going to be.  We are producing 100,000 more animals this year and, suddenly, we cannot kill them.  Where is the industry going?<\/p><p> We constantly hear about new markets being opened.  Where has the MII, as an organisation, gone to try to ensure when these markets have been opened up that our product is being sold into it?  Has MII spent money to go to ensure that these markets are being pursued when the are being reopened?  It is a long way to go to get something to Japan, but I was in Japan recently and I am aware that what is part of the fifth quarter is now going into Japan at a price nearly 1,000 times better than what we were getting two months ago in this country for it.<\/p><p> Returning to where farmers need advice, when the dairy sector was making changes in the way farmers would be paid and the product they wanted produced, farmers were given notice.  Suddenly, at two or three months' notice, farmers are told anything over 16 months old is not wanted and anything over 400 kg is not wanted.  That is not acceptable.  The MII has got to work in co-operation with the primary producer, which is the farmer.  It looks as if the MII is trying to soften the blow to the farmers in relation to post-2015, when quotas come into effect, there will be many more Friesian-type animals in the country and, suddenly, the MII will not need a bull beef sector.  It will come along and take cattle at whatever price it can source them because there will not be a demand and there will not be the same quality in the country.<\/p><p> How many, not counting farmers, are working directly in the meat sector in this country?  What percentage of the kill in Northern Ireland is controlled by factories from the South?  I refer to the big players such as AIBP, Kepak and Dawn Meats.  Perhaps MII could give me those figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400019#V00700","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393950900,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Having listened to the two different presentations today from the group earlier on and this group, it is amazing that they paint such a different picture.  If a visitor was here an hour and a half ago, he or she would have heard of an sector on its knees and in crisis.  In the MII presentation, Mr. Healy paints a picture of an excellent performance over the past five years, with improved efficiency, improved price and improved markets - entering 75 countries - compared to the position in 2005.  If one talks to producers, however, that is not really the case.<\/p><p>  Without primary producers, the MII has nothing.  The primary producers are in serious difficulty, and not for the first time.  This is history repeating itself.  Every two-to-three years, this issue arises and there is no certainty.  The big issue is no certainty.<\/p><p>  Without wishing to rehash the point, the 16 month old bull beef issue has been rehashed repeatedly here.  There is no denying, although the MII has said otherwise, that primary producers were encouraged down that road by the MII and others, and it is an unfair practice to change the goalposts now in midstream.<\/p><p>  As I stated earlier, there is a short-term problem at present.  First, there is the age limit where farmers cannot get their animals killed.  Over the weekend, I spoke to a farmer who had 100 bulls three weeks over age in his shed and nobody will even talk to him, let alone kill them.  What is he going to do with those?  Every day they are a day older and they will be of less value to anybody.  It is costing money.<\/p><p>  Mr. Healy made, I suppose, the fair point that prices have improved over the past four or five years, but the costs of production have also risen, probably by much more, which creates another difficulty.<\/p><p>  I ask them to comment on a specific point made in an earlier presentation on access to the CMS AIMs within the factories.  Who has access to that?  Is it confined to MII management?  Is it confined to veterinaries?  The perception is that persons have access to that system who should not have access to it, they are able to manipulate the system and able to know who has what, for example, that farmer X or Y should have Z amount of cattle coming next week or the following week.  The perception is that one is able to control the numbers coming in on a week-to-week basis.<\/p><p>  I was also disappointed to hear in the MII presentation that there has been no promotion of beef by retailers since Christmas.  That, to me, was disappointing.  The MII is feeding into the retailers around Europe and, thankfully, from that point of view, there are now more of them.  Why was there no promotion?  One would imagine that in times of difficulty more promotion would be required to create more markets for that.  It is something that needs to be investigated.<\/p><p>  Post 2015, when milk quotas are abolished, there will be more dairy-type beef animals coming into the system and we will need more markets for them.  What is the future for those?  Even though Mr. Healy would say that the future is rosy, that would not be the case.  If we continue as we are, we will go down the same road every couple of years.  We might have two good years followed by three bad years and then cycle will repeat itself.  Every time we have two or three bad years, one will lose an increasing number of producers, which has a knock-on effect for the sector.<\/p><p>  There is Food Harvest 2020 targets to achieve.  At one stage, these seemed realistic but at this stage one would have to question whether or not those targets are achievable.  Some 30,000 is the number being killed at present.  Once we go over that 30,000 mark, there seems to be a problem.  Our target in Food Harvest 2020 is 40,000.  What if the position is that once we hit the 31,000 mark, all of a sudden there will be a drop in price and then we will be in trouble?  That seems to be how the trend is developing.<\/p><p>  A question that arises from time to time is the feedlot issue.  Does the industry support feedlots or does it have feedlots?  How many feedlots does it have or what type of numbers would it have in those feedlots at any given time?  If there is a number of feedlots, and Mr. Healy may correct me if I am wrong, the perception is the feedlots would have a substantial number of animals coming in at any one time and one could choose from them to depress the price of the market.  Is that the case?  If so, it is something that needs regulation.<\/p><p>  Finally, the MII might have attended as part of the process when the committee was dealing with grocery related matters last year.<\/p> <p>Would the organisation favour a round-table discussion at this committee on the regulation and future of the industry and all matters relating to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400020#W00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393951500,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I apologise for having had to step out and I thank Deputy Deering for having taken the chair.  If the question I am about to ask has been addressed, I ask the delegates to forgive me for posing it.  We are told that the genesis of this problem stemmed from a change in the specification for young bull beef.  Page 20 of the delegates' submission states that in respect of young bulls, the UK retail requirement is for less than 16 month only and that there is limited opportunity for some older young bulls in continental markets  - processor specific.  I note from the statistics provided that, in 2013, 247,000 tonnes of beef were exported to the UK, 211,000 tonnes were exported to the remainder of continental Europe and 8,000 tonnes were exported to international markets - Russia, Egypt and others.  In respect of that 247,000 tonnes of beef, will the delegates outline what percentage of it was young bull beef under 16 months and what percentages of it were steers and heifers?  I would have thought that, traditionally,  the market in the UK for beef exports was not for not young bulls, as I would have associated that market as being in continental Europe, be they animals under 18 months or whatever.  There has been a difficulty, as was outlined in previous presentations earlier, about the Derrypatrick project, in which all players were supposed to have been involved, targeting, detailing and trailing a system in respect of 18-month old beef of 400 kg weight.  That seemed to be the clear message that was being given by everybody.  The delegates might also answer that question.  I will return to Mr. Healy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400021#X00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393951500,"counter":79,"content":"<p>If I might comment briefly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400021#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1393951500,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400021#X00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393951500,"counter":81,"content":"<p>In broad terms, there is a major dispute as to where we are, never mind how we got here.  In terms of our presentation of where the industry is, the value of it and the progress that has been made, those are facts.  We have not embellished anything.  The  fact that there has been a sustained 40% increase in cattle prices has been a major and positive achievement in the middle of a recession when the Irish economy has lost &euro;30 billion of GDP, Irish consumers have seen their spending fall by &euro;15 billion and &euro;1.5 billion a year extra has been delivered to beef farmers.<\/p><p>  With regard to signalling by the industry and what that has been about for the past five, six and ten years, particularly with regard to young bull beef, it has been very specific.  We worked hard within Food Harvest 2020 segment, first, to make sure that there was a beef story in it because there seemed to be a large part of the agri-community who did not want a beef story, and, second, to make sure that very explicit statements were made by the implementation group about what the market requirements were, particularly around bull beef.  Very strong statements, in black and white, were made in 2010 and before that about what the specifications were for young bull beef - that they were for 16 months and younger and that if anybody was doing something more than that and wanted to talk to particular processors that they should do so.  <\/p><p>  In terms of where we are and how we got here, we would disagree with a view that would point out, first, that we are in a bad place and that the reason we are is that the industry did not communicate because the industry has strongly communicated, and, second, that we are in quite a strong position.  We are in a situation where 99% of all our beef goes to markets in Europe.  The industry faced a major challenge ten years ago.  At the time of intervention and export refunds the challenge put to this industry was to become market-driven and not support-led.  We now have major access to markets.  Deputies raised the issue of other markets.  We would love to get certain products into the Japanese market and they would enhance the return and that enhancement of the return would be passed back through the system.  Access to the US  and Canada is imminent and all such openings of market access are very important to us, both reputationally and in giving us a spread of markets.  <\/p><p>  This industry has delivered in terms of what it has invested in capturing markets.  On some of the issues such as contracts that have been addressed, to return to Food Harvest 2020, an issue for the implementation group at that time was that the industry should have been mandated, never mind encouraged, to increase contracts, particularly with winter finishers.  The industry made a commitment to that group to do so and has increased the amount of beef under contract.  That was done on the basis that if people were going to commit to extra costs that they would be given a commitment in terms of market outlets.  Everything that can be done in order to facilitate the supply side here has been done.  This industry is hugely dependent on the decision of individual farmers to continue in the beef business.  We know that is a very competitive situation and that there are structural and other cost issues, as have been mentioned, but the industry is not foolish in that context.  We have neither signalled a product that the market does not want nor have we asked producers to get involved in production systems that do not meet the market specification.  We would have not have a beef industry in the future if we did that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400021#X00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393951500,"counter":82,"content":"<p>As we have said on a number of occasions regarding the communication on the specification in respect of beef under 16 months and when it was communicated, a point to which Deputy Heydon specifically referred, it goes back to Food Harvest 2020 because at that time and at the time of the subsequent beef activation group there was a largely farmer-driven increase in bull production conversion in Ireland and people were trying out the system because of the efficiencies in terms of weight gain and growth rate that it delivered.  The communication was made as far back as then.  On numerous occasions companies in their engagement at meetings with Teagasc etc. discussed these issues and it was constantly highlighted from the industry's perspective that steer and heifer production was what the industry and Irish beef exports have been built on and that they will remain the key driver of development in the future.  That is what the European marketplace is seeking from Ireland.  Bull beef is produced on the Continent.  Therefore, they have that and they are looking for something different.<\/p><p>  I would refer to one market, the German market, which we lost many years ago at the dawning of the first BSE crisis and while significant progress has been made by us in that market, ten to 15 years ago we were out of that market overnight, as many markets had closed at that stage.  The Argentinian and Uruguayan markets took up the mantle and produced steer and heifer beef and they had a stranglehold on that market for many years.  Thankfully, in more recent years, because of the fall-off in exports from Argentinian and less product coming through from Uruguay, the Irish industry has successfully re-established itself as an exporter of steer and heifer beef.  It is important that we say that and put that message out, but it has been said already.  <\/p><p>  We are glancing over, to some extent, what is the driver of difficulties at the moment, and in so far as there are difficulties it is a very difficult market.  Reference was made by Deputy Deering to the lack of promotional activity.  That is one of the issues in that because of relativities of beef price versus some of the other meat proteins, there has not been any significant level of promotional activity that would start to drive volume and move product through the system.  There are other issues affecting the market.  The fact that we had a reasonably mild January and February is not good for beef sales.  Mild, wet weather does not help sell beef to consumers.  It has not driven any sales over the last number of months.  That and a number of other issues are putting a considerable pressure on the industry in terms of moving product.  The issue that will be of most concern to a processing company - at the end of the day we take cattle, break them up, process them into cuts and sell them - is a building stock level in vac-pac chilled products and there not being movement in those products at the end of the week.  That is a factor and it is a driver.  In such circumstances, animals that are at the extremes of, or outside, specifications will be the ones that will suffer most.  That is the reality of it.  Why would somebody who was producing an animal that is in specification and can possibly find more market outlets be penalised in that regard? <\/p> <p>In terms of having cattle killed, when we met the IFA leadership we asked for names to be put forward.  Ten days ago we gave a commitment to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that any individual issue brought to the attention of a meat plant or Meat Industry Ireland would be pursued.  The reality is, however, that the young bull kill has increased from 4,000 per week to 5,500 per week and, over the last four weeks, to 6,500 per week on average.  Last week 18% more young bulls were killed compared to the same week last year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400021#X00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393952100,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The figure for steers dropped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400022#Y00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393952100,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Steers have tended back a small amount but they were up last week.

The industry is working to manage the situation.  It is a balancing act between a difficult market and lower demand but the industry has increased the kill of young bulls to deal with the backlog, in line with the commitments it gave.  The issue of price was raised.  I recognise that price is important to an individual producer who is about to sell cattle but we must also consider the sector in an overall context.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has reported that between 1 January and today prices fell by between 5 cent and 7 cent across the full mix of steers and heifers.  The Chairman referred to contracts in feedlots.  I do not have specific numbers but the industry has been encouraged to develop contracts for the winter finishing part of the business because we need year round supplies.<\/p><p>  I am not familiar with the specific case of similar Irish and English cuts being sold for the same price but it tells me little in an overall sense.  I cannot base an analysis on a photograph of two cuts of meat.  The industry deserves more than that kind of analysis.  It does not suggest the price at which the product was purchased.  We are selling 50% of the animals processed in Ireland, by weight, to the UK market.  There will always be a premium for UK red tractor domestic beef compared to imported beef but we are at the higher end of price levels in Europe.

This is totally unacceptable, absolutely against the concept of a single market, [with which I concur] and is yet another example of the growing concentration of slaughter capacity both north, south and in the UK.  <\/blockquote>ICOS stated: <blockquote>ICOS has raised these barriers to the free trade of live cattle on numerous occasions at National and EU level only to be informed that the EU requirement on the meat labelling regulation was to blame.  This assertion is not accurate as the retailers can easily label beef meat to comply with these regulations when it suits them.<\/blockquote>ICOS also stated that research carried out in Britain showed no adverse purchasing habits were demonstrated.

I understand it is not as black and white in the Irish situation despite what was said.  I will double check that in regard to labelling because of the peculiar nature of this island.<br \/>We export live cattle to Italy labelling them Irish born, Italian bred and Italian slaughtered or whatever the mix is.  Why is it that Irish-British and Irish-Northern Irish movement of animals seems so problematic and seems to go totally against the spirit of free trade within the European Union?  It would seem be contrary to free trade.<br \/>I refer to what was said about British prices and the way cattle are sold.  This committee was told by different people, including the Minister and one of the farming organisations, that British housewives had a huge preference for British beef, that they were willing to pay a lot more for British-labelled beef and that was the reason one could not sell an Irish animal to a British member of MII, or one of the subsidiaries to which Deputy Colreavy referred, which is paying much more than the equivalent Irish factory for the same animal.  One could not sell there because when the British housewife found out it was Irish, she would not pay the price.  The evidence would suggest that, like-for-like, the British housewife will pay the price.  If there are parts of the animal which are better sold on continental Europe, presumably it is sold where the highest market is but that is neither here nor there.  However, it does not explain how it is so hard to get Irish cattle killed in British abattoirs and factories, which is what we are hearing all the time, irrespective of whether they are owned by companies which are controlled ultimately from here or whether they are British organisations.  It seems the free market has broken down.  Many people believe it is not as simple as that.<br \/>I ask about Polish beef processed here, the quantities and the processes by which we ensure it stays as Polish beef and does not get labelled as anything else, as happened in the past with product which came in and was wrongly mislabelled going out.  Perhaps Mr. Healy could explain to us the quantities of Polish beef being processed here by MII members.  What do they do to ensure it does not get mixed up with beef from any other country and mislabelled somewhere down the line, as happened in the past?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400023#Z00100","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393952700,"counter":94,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Colreavy's questions, companies here have an involvement with or own processing facilities in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.

In terms of specifications and who makes them, a specification is something a customer, whether a retailer, a food service operator or a wholesaler, will have.  It will deal with matters such as the type of animals it wants it coming from, what age, what weight and what kind of cut size.  In some cases, it may be cut size.  It will also deal with many other things in terms of supply arrangements, whether it is weekly or twice weekly, the type of mix of cuts of it is willing to take and what they do during promotions.  They are predominantly set out by the meat buyers and the meat buying team of that customer.  They vary to some extent among customers.  That is my understanding of where they are established.  It is by the meat buyer and the meat buying team of the customer.  They outline these specifications.  The Deputy must understand it may not only be an Irish supplier delivering product to the customer.  Depending on the customer, it could be a supplier from Italy, Spain, Poland, France or elsewhere.  The process commences with the customer.<\/p><p>  In terms of the process of listing, it is feet on the street ultimately.  As the Deputy will be aware, Bord Bia is the marketing agency.  It has a number of offices throughout Europe with responsibility for various markets.  They would constantly survey the market, establish where the key purchasers of beef are, etc. and put Irish companies in contact with them.  Equally, Irish companies will have offices on the ground.  It is something that is built up over a long number of years.  Just because one knows there is a significant buyer there does not mean one will get the business with the buyer.  One makes one's pitch and tries to present what one can supply, etc.  If things go well, one is listed and delivers a particular type of product over a particular period of time.  That is how it builds up over time.  It is about knowledge of the market.<\/p><p>  The Deputy spoke about the regulation of price.  I do not believe there is a requirement for regulation.  There is no regulation at other points along the chain.  I go back to the point of delivery which the industry has.  When one asks a question like that, it would suggest there is not delivery on price or that there is a real problem.  We are not belittling or under-stating the issues there at the moment.  They are market-driven but, overall, there has been price delivery.  What industry has achieved in sales has been returned into a producer price and a cattle price on the ground.<\/p> <p>I can only comment on some of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's other remarks because, ultimately, we are not here speaking on behalf of Northern Irish industry.  There are still significant live exports to Northern Ireland, according to figures I have seen.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that there is a reluctance on the part of British or Irish owned operations in England to take Irish cattle.<\/p><p> I acknowledge he said he will check on the labelling regulations.  However, they are in place and my clear understanding of them is that an animal, for example, born and reared in Ireland and slaughtered in Northern Ireland is not labelled \"Origin: Ireland\".  If it is born, reared and slaughtered in the Republic, we can label it \"Origin: Ireland\".  If it is slaughtered in Northern Ireland, it has to be labelled \"Born and reared in Ireland.  Slaughtered in the UK\".  That is my understanding of the labelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400023#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393953300,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Does that apply to Polish beef as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014030400024#AA00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1393953300,"counter":101,"content":"<p>That applies to Polish, French, Italian or German beef.

The first is the message the employment Ministers will send to the European Council on the priorities for the fourth European semester.  Second is the adoption of a Council decision making some adjustments to the constitution of the tripartite social summit for growth and employment, which usually meets in advance of the European Council each spring and autumn.  The third issue for discussion is the adoption of the Council recommendation on a quality framework for traineeships.  Fourth on the agenda is a lunchtime discussion on the youth guarantee.<\/p><p>  The European semester process begins with the publication by the Commission of an assessment of growth opportunities in the Union, which is followed by a debate on the needs thrown up by the growth survey.  Coming out of that process is the publication of country-specific recommendations as to what each member state needs to do in order to meet the needs of European growth and achieve the co-ordination that is necessary across the Union.  The adoption of these recommendations follows later in the process.  This year, the country-specific recommendations will, for the first time, apply to Ireland.  We were not included prior to this because we were in the troika process.  The expectation on this occasion is that the recommendations for Ireland will focus on the same issues highlighted by the troika.  The task for employment Ministers is to ensure there is sufficient emphasis on growth and employment opportunities within a broad European framework of economic policy.  This is against a background where many EPSCO members are of the view that the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, has had an excessive say in these matters.  EPSCO has made some progress in this battle in terms of achieving a more balanced debate.<\/p><p>  The second issue for discussion is essentially a technical matter, namely, to include the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, in the tripartite social summit for growth and employment, together with the rotating Presidents of the Employment Council and the President of the Commission.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, will lead for Ireland on the third and fourth issues on the agenda, namely, the adoption of the Council recommendation on a quality framework for traineeships and the discussion on the youth guarantee.<\/p><p>  In addition, we hope there will be a positive outcome to the agreement reached at the December EPSCO on the posted workers enforcement directive.  This requires that where a company in one member state wins a contract in another, the contractor must apply the employment conditions that prevail in the country where the contract was won.  The directive has gone through a very lengthy process, but we seem finally to have reached a point where the trilogues between Parliament, Council and Commission have resulted in an agreed text that is likely to be adopted.<\/p><p>  Finally, there may be a discussion on the targets for 2020 in regard to research and development, climate change, education, poverty and social inclusion, and employment.  There is talk of an exchange of views in this regard, but it probably will not be a very substantive debate because the incoming Commission is expected to bring forward proposals in the autumn to launch a mid-term review of the 2020 strategy.  The expectation is that this review will be where the real business is done, once the new Commission is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400003#C00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1393956000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

In terms of what has been worked out, the two committees, EPSCO and ECOFIN would have the capacity to present on an equal basis.  That was brokered through our own work last year and worked much better last year under our Presidency than it had in the previous years where the employment Ministers felt they were not getting a fair say.  It has improved, and I believe it will continue to improve.

I have no doubt that some of the country-specific recommendations will focus in on training and activation and the policies that are being pursued by Government and will be looking at ways in which we could improve them.  The report on apprenticeship has just been published and although it is the area of responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, I have taken a keen interest in it.  Basically, it seeks to simplify apprenticeship and to make it shorter and easier to introduce new skills within the apprenticeship programme.  Clearly, there will be an invitation to tender from industry to get involved in new apprenticeships.  That will be one of the initiatives of SOLAS during the course of the year to invite expressions of interest to take up new areas where apprenticeships could be developed.  This will be an interesting area.  There is much currency in Europe about how well the German and Austrian system has weathered the recession and that countries that have that strong apprenticeship tradition have weathered the recession much better than others.  There is a keen interest to build and develop stronger apprenticeships and traineeships in Europe.  That will be a major focus of the discussion.<\/p><p>  Workers' rights and work strikes appear in individual directives.  The posted workers directive is finally crossing the line.  As I have explained, it is about workers winning contracts in an overseas market, what they will be paid when they come from one country to be posted in another and how enforcement can be conducted.  The directive attempts to have a harmonised system of enforcement applying right across Europe.  It sets out the type of enforcement regime that can be put in place.<\/p><p>  While the situation regarding Ukraine is very disturbing, I would not venture to speculate on its potential impact on economic affairs.  Clearly it has potential to have an impact depending on how the situation develops but I am not qualified to comment.  The wide issue of how to create a recovery and growth strategy dominated debate during our Presidency when the broad budget for the coming years was put in place.  As the committee is aware, that included programmes such as COSME, which is for small business and access to finance; Horizon 2020, which was a big winner with Europe seeing investment in research and development and commercialisation of research and development as being very important; the youth guarantee; winning additional money and focusing on countries with over 25% youth employment; the whole debate about strengthening the skills area; and the ESF moneys.

Presumably youth unemployment would be the main challenge for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400004#D00700","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1393956000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I believe it would be long-term unemployment as well as youth unemployment.<\/p> <p>Our unemployment is particularly affected by the collapse in construction, where employment went from approximately 300,000 to 100,000.

It is not that Europe is seeking to impose many new obligations on employers.  The thrust in Europe recently has been not to undermine workers' rights but to reduce regulation in areas where it is unnecessary.  Obviously areas such as the posting of workers overseas was one where there was a perception, and a reality, that people's rights were being abused and there was no enforcement mechanism to deal with it.  That is the reason for the debate about enforcement for posted workers overseas.  To my knowledge, there has not been a welter of new regulations being imposed on member states.  There were in the past, such as the working time directive which governs certain provisions and so forth, but one cannot say that in the midst of this crisis Europe is seeking to make it harder to employ people.  There is no evidence that country-specific recommendations or directives are going in that direction.  Arguably, it is in the other direction whereby they are increasingly focusing on how good the state's training and activation systems are, what it is doing about young people who are out of school for a long period, and how it is picking them up and bringing them back.  That is the focus of European interest, rather than dreaming up new sets of restrictions.<\/p><p>  There are the general matters such as employment equality, consultation, health and safety, mobility or the right to move and the temporary agency workers, on which we had legislation this year.

The threshold for the youth guarantee is 25% unemployment in the youth category, so it is only for countries above that level.  We are on that level so we are included.  We are getting support under that and it was deliberately targeted at the countries that had the biggest problem.  We are not the worst.  There are some chronic cases, such as Greece and Spain which have really serious problems with youth unemployment, but we clearly have a problem in that area.<\/p><p>  The State has been quite successful - I suppose we are old hands at it - in harvesting returns from instruments.  On FP7, which is the big one that we deal with, we box above our weight.  We were the best in terms of SMEs securing draw-down.  Ireland was top of the league in getting draw-down for SMEs from FP7, the research budget, but it is a challenge and we are setting a more ambitious target.  We got approximately &euro;600 million under the last one and we are seeking &euro;1.25 billion this time.<\/p><p>  With regard to the first question, the Deputy answered it himself to a degree within the question.  There is always a conflict between the desire to harmonise and the desire to leave countries with a diversity of tools to respond as appropriate to their circumstances.  By and large, Europe has sought to apply the principle of subsidiarity.  In other words it only seeks to harmonise where it is necessary to the fair operation of the European market.  It does not seek to go below that and it leaves diverse arrangements.  Many of the product markets are being harmonised to avoid non-tariff barriers being used.  They have all been swept away.  However, countries continue to have different regimes in respect of many other areas.  It started from the Common Market so product and service markets have been the focus of attention.  In terms of labour markets, the attention has been to ensure free flow and that people can exercise their rights under the European Union to move from place to place.<\/p> <p>The member states have policed it.  Many member states do not want to see encroachment on what they see as their rights, so they defend their position.  In areas such as tax there is a veto so each member state has a guarantee of freedom of operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400005#E00700","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393957200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Several questions were asked about the European semester process.

The focus on making markets work, taking down barriers to entry and allowing networks throughout the EU to achieve advantages due to the scale of the market have been sensible strategies.  People can rightly criticise and suggest that the budget should have been bigger if the aim was to drive a growth strategy.  We know many countries do not want bigger budgets at European level and Europe can only operate in the areas in which member states permit it to do so.  Europe will always be limited in this respect.<\/p><p>  The structural reforms it sought to introduce are valid.  This country was behind the times with regard to the welfare system.  For years the OECD and the EU criticised Ireland for not having a more developmental welfare system, with more attention on activation and opportunity.  Ours was a model steeped in the idea that one had to be idle to get support, and we needed to move to a model that was more driven by activation and development.  This is what the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, has been trying to do, similarly to policies driven by corporate social responsibility.  It is the same with skills.  People criticised F&Aacute;S and perhaps it got fossilised in the boom times and needed to shift to be more relevant.  These are the policies being pushed.  There is no doubt the policies being advocated are worthwhile.  They are also a spur to change.<\/p><p>  Over time the semester process will probably have greater force as an obligation to act on country-specific recommendations that might be introduced.  At present it is moral pressure but over time, if certain countries fall out of kilter with regard to some of the bigger indicators, these policies will take the force of obligations, as they were when we were in the troika process.  In response to the crisis we see more vigorous pursuit of sensible economic policy and it is gradually filtering down from broad fiscal demands to ensure other structural parts of policy instruments work effectively.  This is here to stay, and we will be subject to more scrutiny on how well we are doing.  This is the nature of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400006#F00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1393957200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for briefing the committee prior to the meeting next week in Brussels.

Most members are familiar with the Action Plan for Jobs process.  Each year we consult business, enterprise, those on both sides of industry and entrepreneurs to try to identify pressure points.  We then seek to address them throughout Government.  This year is no different.  I will not go through all of the areas; I will just highlight some where we have a new focus this year.  One is entrepreneurship, where we believe, following the Sean O'Sullivan report, there is much more we can do.  We will have a youth entrepreneurship fund and we will streamline mentoring.  The 31 local enterprise offices will be linked to the centres of excellence.  We will target more female, young and overseas entrepreneurs to try to improve the entire environment.<\/p><p>  Another area is strengthening our platform overseas to win new investment and additional trade.  We received sanction for 34 more IDA personnel overseas and 20 more Enterprise Ireland personnel overseas.  The IDA has a target of 6,000 direct additional jobs over five years and Enterprise Ireland has targets in respect of additional exports to be generated.<\/p><p>  Another theme is manufacturing.  Last year we had a forum on manufacturing and we believe there is potential to drive our manufacturing capability.  This year we will have a targeted approach with regard to 200 mid-sized manufacturing companies which have the capacity to grow, two thirds of which are Enterprise Ireland companies and one third of which are IDA companies.  We will target more manufacturing start-ups and will focus our research and development and tech centres on manufacturing.  Through the Department of Education and Skills we hope to develop new apprenticeship areas in manufacturing.<\/p><p>  The committee is concerned about access to finance, and we have a commitment to improve the terms of the credit guarantee.  We are examining new ways to sweat the existing instruments and we have expanded the reach of the Credit Review Office.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, announced an initiative to strengthen the capability of small and medium enterprises to deal with banks.  We have a continuing commitment to extend the range of alternative finance, examining in particular crowd-funding and peer-to-peer lending.  These new areas are growing rapidly in some countries.<\/p><p>  We will also have continuing emphasis on sectors of opportunity and improving the business environment.  These are areas that have become the bread and butter of the annual process.  This year we will place a particular focus on skills.  SOLAS will publish its strategy before the end of next month and we will roll out actions on the apprenticeship review.<\/p><p>  Some of the issues targeted by the committee have been picked up with regard to unemployment and youth unemployment . We will try to build programmes with stronger linkages to the labour market.<\/p> <p>That is a focus of the Department's work in the areas of both activation and skills.  As for a national youth strategy on entrepreneurship, effectively we will start that process with a youth entrepreneurship fund.  The revamp and the reform of the apprenticeship system, which the joint committee highlighted, will be implemented this year.  On the social economy, as members are aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is working on a group in the social enterprise area and it is hoped to have actions arising therefrom in the course of the year.<\/p><p> As for the joint committee's second report on mentoring, as part of the partnership focus, the Department has commissioned work on mentoring and has carried out an evaluation.  I have just recently had sight of this report, which will be published.  There has been an evaluation carried out of our mentoring programmes which, as members are aware, are scattered.  Some are funded by the State, such as those in the local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland and Skillnets, but there are many other players in that environment.  The aim will be to try to sharpen and improve the quality of mentoring, to have greater benchmarking of precisely what is achieved by mentoring projects and to try to deliver a better service.  The creation of the centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland, which will oversee both the mentoring activities of the LEOs and the agency's own mentoring programme, provides a tool with which to work on streamlining in this area.  While Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins is not present today, she has been extremely active in this area.<\/p><p> As for the south east, the Department continues to have an action plan for the south east in terms of its performance and we have had some very good wins.  The overall employment numbers in the south east published last week were exceptionally good with a net increase in employment in that region of 15,000 and a reduction of 3.3% in the unemployment rate over the year.  That almost was the best regional performance in the country.  There have been a number of successes, many of them on the Enterprise Ireland and indigenous side, as opposed to the foreign direct investment, FDI, side, although there were some FDI investments such as Nypro.  However, the Department continues to have a focus on the south east, which, even though it has improved, still has the highest unemployment rate in the country.  Its industrial base needs to be strengthened and the IDA has committed to build a 2,500 sq. m life sciences facility this year, which again is a recognition that its enterprise infrastructure must be strengthened.  Much of what was in that report goes well beyond my areas of responsibility but they are continuing concerns in respect of the action plan for the south east.<\/p><p> I can probably answer questions on the budget allocations, as they are published.  However, it is hard to go through them as they are merely presented in tabular form.  However, there may be underlying issues with which I could deal.  On the moratorium on recruitment to Enterprise Ireland, since 2009 the agency has reduced its staff by approximately 20% and there undoubtedly has been considerable consolidation in Enterprise Ireland.  To be fair to Enterprise Ireland, a huge number of staff members, approximately 250 of them, have changed their roles.  In other words, there has been huge adaptation of existing staff to the challenges and programmes that have evolved.  Naturally, matters continue to evolve and new things have been done in the recession, such as setting up a potential exporters division, greatly enhancing the area that considers lean processes in the existing manufacturing base to try to improve processes therein.  Moreover, there have been efforts to establish a stronger technology transfer operation.  The position is changing and evolving continually as, for example, female entrepreneurship now has become a major part of Enterprise Ireland's work.  I believe concern regarding this issue arose on foot of an internal audit that indicated this pace of change was placing strain on the organisation, which undoubtedly it is.  However, to be fair both to those employed and the leadership, that is, both Frank Ryan and now Julie Sinnamon, in my view it has been a really strong organisation as an example of reinventing itself continually even in a difficult environment.  It has not failed to deliver on any of its key commitments in respect of the Action Plan for Jobs.  I consider it to be a good organisation working in a difficult area with diminishing resources but that is the reality for all my agencies, with the exception of the IDA, which has been protected because of the crucial role that has been playing in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400006#F00700","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393957800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions in respect of the Action Plan for Jobs.

Thereafter, I wish to examine the financial side of things and I then wish to make some general comments, if that is all right.  I will keep them as brief as I can.<\/p><p>  Last year, the big idea of the plan was disruptive reforms and the first of which was to make Ireland the leading country in Europe for big data.  How many jobs were created directly in the intervening 12 months or are in the pipeline because of that reform?  The third disruptive reform listed was the creation of a single licensing application system for the retail sector.  The Minister should provide members with an update on the current status in that regard.  In addition, there was a target to get 2,000 more small businesses trading online.  What precisely is the current figure?  While the Minister still aims to have 2,000 by 2015, which was last year's target, what is the figure at present?  Has Enterprise Ireland in particular carried out work in this regard?  I note the plan was launched in the offices of a company that specialises in getting retailers online, which is an area in which I have a particular interest.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of points in respect of finance.  The joint committee has engaged in considerable discussion about Microfinance Ireland and the credit guarantee scheme not reaching or coming close to reaching their targets.  The Minister was reviewing the credit guarantee scheme and should indicate what is the current status of that review.  What changes have been made to either scheme?  What is the position in respect of a new CEO for Microfinance Ireland?  The Minister referred to a point contained in the Action Plan for Jobs, which is that the Department is considering alternative sources of financing.  Three weeks ago, the joint committee heard a presentation from Linked Finance on crowd financing.  I acknowledge this is not in the Minister's nature, but would it not be worth taking a punt on that company in a pilot scheme with a small amount of money?  That company came before the joint committee in the company of some of its clients and they had fantastic stories to tell about jobs created that otherwise would not have been created.  In particular, given that the credit guarantee scheme and Microfinance Ireland are so behind target, I challenge the Minister to take a punt on a pilot scheme similar to what has been done in the United Kingdom in respect of crowd financing.<\/p><p>  During the debate on the Estimates a few weeks ago, I raised a concern with the Minister that the targets for the IDA in particular and for Enterprise Ireland for 2014 were less than what they had achieved in 2013.  My concern is that when they overshoot those targets, as they will because they are beneath the achievements of 2013, it will be another opportunity to claim one is great because one has created more jobs.  The major new initiative of this year's action plan to target 10,000 new jobs from the IDA, in addition to those targets that already have been set.  The target is for 6,000 jobs created directly and a further 4,000 created indirectly over five years, which works out at 1,200 direct and 800 indirect job creations each year and the Department proposes to provide additional resources to the IDA to do this.  The intention is to target Middle Eastern markets in particular.  However, in 2013, the IDA created 7,070 jobs net and its target for 2014 is 6,000 jobs net.  The Minister is setting an ambitious new target that he knows will be reached, based on 2013 activity and the world economy improving.  The Minister was somewhat snippy earlier in the Chamber about Deputy Martin's criticisms of the Action Plan for Jobs but this is the kind of thing that frustrates people, that is, where targets are being set beneath the previous monthly or yearly targets.  They will be surpassed because the IDA is a fantastic organisation doing a great job and the Minister is providing it with the resources it needs.  Consequently, this is a source of frustration.  The other issue concerns the timeline in respect of a review of regional policy to which the Minister has committed in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.<\/p> <p>What is the timeline for that?  When will we see the changes?  Deputy Conaghan spoke about a three- or four-speed Europe in terms of economic recovery, but we have that on this island.<\/p><p> I welcome some of the initiatives on youth employment, particularly on youth entrepreneurship.  We really need to move the debate on and encourage people to set up their own businesses.  I welcome the fact the Minister is examining Sean O'Sullivan's report.  The Minister has committed to looking at the taxation supports for entrepreneurship in 2014.  Sean O'Sullivan's group has made some really interesting proposals with regard to taxation of entrepreneurship, capital gains tax, etc.  What are the Minister's and the Department's views on that report?<\/p><p> I refer to the jobs figures for 2013.  There is an issue in that there were 13,800 fewer employed in the 15-to-34 age group than at the end of 2012.  The number of 15-to-24 year olds in the workforce was down by approximately 12,000 in 2013 and the number of 25-to-34 year olds in the labour force was down nearly 25,000.<\/p><p> Emigration is still a major problem.  The Minister said the Action Plan for Jobs would create jobs, but can we get all the heads which he says are working together on the Action Plan for Jobs to start to focus on emigration in particular?  Why are we losing 25,000 people, including some of our most talented people?   These are the people who might benefit from Sean O'Sullivan's recommendations, if implemented, and whom the IDA is trying to sell as our educated workforce, yet 25,000 have emigrated.  I am not saying this as a party political charge, but there seems to be a comfort within the system that emigration is there.  There seems to be very little discussion about the seriousness of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400007#G00400","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393958400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>To start with big data, I suspect we could probably aim for something like 5,000 jobs over a certain period of time.  However, one cannot set an annual target in this area.  What one can say for definite - I can get the data for the Deputy - is that we have had several wins in the IDA area in big data.  In order to create the ecosystem, or whatever one likes to call it, in which big data will thrive, we have established the Insight research centre.   That was our biggest punt.  I think it was &euro;88 million.  We have made a big punt on big data, building the capability in this research area.  Similarly, we have created a technology centre with both SMEs and IDA Ireland for the application of big data.  We have had a series of IDA wins in this area and we are seeking to open up the public data holding as a resource to drive new business opportunities.<\/p><p>  One could say that over a five-year period we should see 5,000 jobs, which would be to use a sort of broad brush, but in an emerging area such as this, one could not possibly say we will stand and fall by a certain number of jobs next year.

Someone is looking at having a collective for the town.  That is being done by way of a private initiative and we are not putting money behind it.  However, we are trying to move businesses from having a presence online to actively trading online, and we are targeting businesses to go that extra distance.  Many of them will have a presence but will not actively trade.  I think this will be huge.  One can see it already.  People are buying their clothes in a different way.  I believe that in future retail will carry less stock and will use online trading tools.  People will still go into a shop to try things on and to look at the range of things but it will be a different model.  I think we have to get people to think in this vein, and we have been working on that.<\/p><p>  The specific changes to the credit guarantee scheme are around all of the criteria, although I do not have them with me.  We will have to introduce them legislatively, so they will be coming before the House.  They are changes to the level of guarantee.

In discussions with practitioners, we have identified a suite of changes.  I suppose those on the Opposition benches will say they told us so.  Obviously we got approval for a certain approach, but it can do more than it is doing and we will bring forward legislation to do that.<\/p><p>  We have changed some of the terms for the micro-finance scheme, such as not requiring a refusal, to make it easier.  We have had meetings with the banks to try to ensure that where refusals go out, micro-finance is plugged with banks.  There is scope for more.  The LEOs will be in place as a first-stop shop and as agents for micro-finance, and we hope we will drive take-up.  If one looks at the county take-up, one will see that some counties have simply not bought into it at all.

The old target of bank approvals did not work, because even though the banks were perceived to have been meeting growing targets in approving facilities, the actual amount of new lending was declining.  We are now going to be more granular on what exactly is happening.  My ambition is to set targets in regard to things that matter to business.  It had a certain merit but it was not delivering the sort of change required.  The commitment is to go in more closely, looking at individual products.<\/p><p>   I think there is an improvement.  The Deputy will see that the refusal rates have dropped.   The RedC surveys have shown that refusal rates have dropped quite considerably, from 30% to 20%.  Within the pillar banks, it is quite low - I think it is around 16%.  If one looks within the pillar banks for export-oriented companies, it is quite low.  Undoubtedly, there is an improvement.  The interviews are taking place this week for the CEO of Microfinance Ireland.  <\/p><p>  I do not disagree with the Deputy that crowd financing is an area at which we should look really hard.  There was a crowd financing gig last week which I and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, attended.  We are looking really hard at it.  Obviously, we cannot commit to one company in particular because of public procurement issues.   We are looking really hard at what we can do to promote that.<\/p> <p>The Deputy referred to job targets.  One cannot take the IDA for granted.  Over recent years the number of jobs created went from 5,000 net to 6,000 net to 6,500 net and it will be at the mid-point of those figures for next year.  We are taking a mid-point from what were regarded as three record years as our target.  If the IDA delivers that, it is a reasonable target.  We will continue to review it but the additional resources are justified.  The authority is not overstaffed for what it is delivering.  There was not spare capacity to deliver more jobs with existing resources.<\/p><p> We have examined with the authority areas where it could do more and it has targeted specific sectors, emerging companies and emerging countries and that is why we are putting more feet on the ground to deliver the additional 10,000 jobs over a number of years.  It will be approximately 1,200 a year but that is a credible target.  If we can continue to grow export oriented companies at the rate of recent years through the two agencies over the next number of years, we will be doing well.  We will be looking to see whether the domestic economy can respond to that export-led performance.  This year, we will look for a recovery in the construction sector from the floor it has hit.  If we can keep the two agencies performing at this level, that would be a good performance in the teeth of difficult export markets.<\/p><p> There is not a regional enterprise policy currently.  This is the first time we are seriously examining how we can design such a policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400008#H00800","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393959000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>What about the IDA's targets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400009#J00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1393959000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>That is a target at national level outside Dublin and Cork.  My challenge is how to get the midlands or whichever region to perform better and examine what enterprise strategy can be implemented, what the region's competitive strengths are, the IDA, EI and LEO strategies and how we can get the stakeholders in the regions to back credible programmes of action to drive a successful regional enterprise strategy.  That is needed here.  We do not debate enough where are our competitive strengths.<\/p><p>  This year through our manufacturing initiative, we are consciously looking at the existing base of companies and trying to grow them and such an instrument can be part of a regional strategy, as can a competitive entrepreneurship fund.  We need to develop more tools that can drive such a strategy and that is my ambition in this regard.  I will work with colleagues to ascertain how that can be worked out.<\/p><p>  With regard to the taxation of entrepreneurship, if we could simplify the successors to the BES, including the EIIS, and make them more user friendly, that would be my priority.  They apply to the start-up phase and a PAYE worker can secure a significant block of seed capital to put into a business.  We must simplify those schemes and get them to work.<\/p><p>  I do not deny the emigration figures, which are there for all to see.  Net migration last year was approximately 35,000 with Irish-born people to the fore.  Clearly we have a problem.  On the other hand, we have created 61,000 jobs and, therefore, more jobs are being created than people emigrating.  There is a skills mix issue and that is why skills initiatives should be part of the response.  The Deputy is correct about the younger age groups.  There is a decline in this cohort of the labour force but that is not all explained by emigration.  According to the population curve, the cohort is falling and there is a contraction.  Both the numbers employed and unemployed are reducing.  It is about more than just emigration; there is a contraction in the numbers in the younger age groups.<\/p><p>  However, the numbers will increase because there is a bulge coming through in the school system.  I do not say that as a defence of the migration numbers but there has been employment growth among younger age groups.  This recession has been characterised by an atrocious impact on young people.  By and large, people aged over 35 have not been impacted.  This reflects last in, first out policies, a clampdown on recruitment and so on.  It has had a massive impact on younger people.  All the instruments aimed at young people such as training, ICT skills, Springboard and so on are crucial to confront the emigration issue and to get people skilled in the areas in which they can secure employment in a sustainable, growing economy.  Even during the boom, 15,000 people emigrated annually and, therefore, the numbers emigrating will not reduce to zero.  During the boom years, significant numbers chose to leave.  People make their choice but a total of 35,000 emigrants is not acceptable and, therefore, we need to do better.  Addressing the skills mix is the most effective tool we can use to target emigration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400009#J00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1393959000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I am intrigued as to why another entrepreneurship competition is needed.

Over the past few action plans for jobs, the targets in this regard have been deleted while the IDA reports at the end of each year highlight a collapse in investment outside the two major urban areas in the State.  That is having a significant effect in both areas with regard to pressure on property prices and services and loss of services where there is no investment.  The Action Plan for Jobs does not seek to tackle that in a meaningful way and this is one of the issues that I find increasingly problematic regarding Government policy.<\/p><p>  Access to finance remains a significant issue.  Investors currently are piling into property speculation in localised bubbles, helped by the tax system.  Property speculation is the enemy of enterprise funding.  People want their houses valued properly and they want negative equity to disappear.  They want family homes to be built but they do not want to be elbowed out by speculators and by property values increasing by &euro;100,000 in small pockets of the State.<\/p> <p>The embassy network is not being properly leveraged by Action Plan for Jobs or the Government.  No real, meaningful enterprise targets are in place for embassy staff.  I know that is not their primary job, they are a diplomatic corps.  However, we need to set objectives for them regarding enterprise development.<\/p><p> Social economy is the poor man of the enterprise sector.  These are co-operative organisations that provide services and create jobs and, sometimes, profits.  Not enough is being done regarding them, especially the new enterprise infrastructure that is being created.  One of the major problems regarding the labour supply is the welfare cliff that exists for people who take on work and lose benefits.  I am not sure that is being focused on.  Could the Minister comment on the methods of measurement being used to analyse the success of the particular parts of Action Plan for Jobs?  The debate is two-dimensional.  A proposal is presented and implemented, and that is the end of the discussion.  The output, positive or negative, is not measured.  Education is mentioned a lot in Action Plan for Jobs but in the key areas of science and engineering, especially at third level, we see our education provision drop out of the top 100 universities in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400009#J00800","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393959600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I do not accept that there are no instruments to try to promote a greater regional spread in the IDA.  This year we have committed to build in Letterkenny, Athlone and Waterford.  We have Connect Ireland, an innovative scheme that is delivering a more regional spread.  There was an improvement.  IDA investments outside Dublin went from 23% up to 30% and jobs went from 19% to 35%, so there was an improvement in 2013.  We need to think a little more about how we have a successful regional enterprise strategy.<\/p><p>  Overall the IDA accounts for approximately 8% of employment, so 92% of employment throughout the country is not in IDA firms.  In some counties the proportion of employment represented by the IDA is 2% to 4%.  This has always been the case and is not due to this Government.  A credible regional enterprise strategy cannot be built on the 4% but must be built on the 96%.  I am not saying the 4% is not important.  A win in IDA is crucial.  However, I would like to get away from focusing all the regional enterprise strategy on asking why the IDA is not bringing in more jobs.  This is not to let the IDA off the hook but to talk about what is a credible regional strategy and what can we do.<\/p><p>  That is why this year we have 200 manufacturing companies, 70 IDA and 130 Enterprise Ireland, with a good regional spread.  The challenge is how can we lift their capabilities so our existing base can grow.  Some 70% of IDA growth comes from its existing base.  We are seeking to build from that base.  A credible regional strategy must build from the base, whether IDA or Enterprise Ireland.  I hope this tool will foster a more rounded discussion of what we can do in the regions.<\/p><p>  It is horses for courses with the IDA.  Mobile foreign investment is no longer manufacturing but business services and the nature of the locations they are looking for is different from ten years ago.  We cannot change that.  We cannot say we are going to compete for a different type of project when the mobile investment is in a certain area.  We are out there to win what we can for Ireland Inc. and then try to maximise regional opportunity within that.  We need to develop a credible strategy around this.  The IDA is reviewing our strategy and we will be looking for a regional focus and at sectors where there is potential for a greater regional spread.  We will be asking the IDA to consider sectors on which it has not focused.<\/p><p>  Regarding property speculation, I have seen figures that suggest the replacement cost of some properties is multiples of what one could sell them for on the open market.  There will be no building where that is the case, so we need some correction of prices to get building going again.  If one can buy cheaper than one can build, we will get no building going.  In my area, Dublin, I see some building happening because prices have recovered to a point where people are opening up sites.  There is pressure on certain types of property but with the sort of controls on mortgage lending, I do not see a bubble or major speculation, but clearly we must be attentive.<\/p><p>  The embassy network does not have hard targets.  One wonders if one could develop country targets.  Enterprise Ireland has targets for, say, the Gulf but the embassy would not have targets because it might have separate targets for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  There are targets for the region but Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is right.  The ambassador co-ordinates and tries to drive the team but they still work on the individual targets of their respective agencies.  They are all working to targets.  None of our agencies is without a target to be delivered from the market in which they operate.  There may be a way of addressing this.  A review of the trade strategy has been published but they will examine the country strategies more closely.<\/p><p>  Work is happening in the social economy.

There is a welfare cliff whereby people who step off benefits into work reduce their standard of living.  There is a necessity to ensure those welfare benefits are still in place while those individuals return to work.

The rent would be related to one's income, for example 15% of one's income after a certain figure as opposed to losing everything if one works more than 30 hours.  The intention is to move to this housing assistance payment which will be income related.  That would remove that.  That will be piloted in Limerick around March and the aim is to move it further afield.  That is the major change, moving from social protection to local authority responsibility for it.<\/p> <p>The family income supplement, FIS, fills 60% of the gap between income and target income.  It should bridge the whole gap for families with children, and there is also the retention of the medical card.  There are efforts to try to tackle that trap.  There has been a review of the FIS to see if more can be done in this area.  It is tricky.  As we saw in the UK, there were attempts to reform its income-related measure; it is now four years on and the UK Government has still not been able to implement the change.  The idea was perfect in theory but it seems to have proven to be a disaster in practice.  <\/p><p> I agree with the comments regarding measurement of success, and this year we will look in a more granular fashion at the issue.

For example, with regard to entrepreneurship, we will look to provide an indication of how we are doing in the area.  Having implemented the suite of measures, we could consider how we are doing with the big goal.  That sort of thinking will be introduced as part of this year's plan.<\/p><p> With regard to ranking of universities, with many of those measurements we need to look beneath rankings.

That trickles right through the delivery of services in the county.  This is not just related to the involvement of IDA Ireland; the process must involve Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.<\/p><p>  Previous Governments made brave decisions to have clusters of particular industries in certain locations.  For example, few people would have dreamed of having financial investment in the Dublin docklands, but it was a policy decision to cluster businesses there.  There was also a decision to have clusters of medical technology companies in the west and pharmaceuticals in the south.  We do not seem to have such brave policy decisions to have clusters of new industries.  As the Minister mentioned, there is a change in the type of mobile investment that is happening but there is no decision that certain parts of the country will have a clustered centre that could create its own gravity, meaning we will not have to hold the hand of certain areas in ten or 15 years to bring in investment.  If successful, mobile investment should want to go to a certain area because of the ten or 15 businesses already clustered there.

By all means, we can make a play to win the relevant business in that regard, and that is the sort of discussion we must have with respect to regional opportunity.  The west has been very successful in that regard, and if we can build clusters we will do so.

People seem to forget that this economy collapsed a very short time ago.  In that context, a considerable amount has been achieved.  Some of these criticisms are glib and there is the idea that we started on a very high wave of momentum, but we started in a trough and we have emerged from that in a very short space of time.  It is a remarkable story and if Oscar awards were going for this area this country would be up there, like the actors in Hollywood the other night, claiming one of them.

We need to take the imaginative leap on the western coast, particularly in Killybegs, the premier fishing port, to do for the fishing industry what was done for the agricultural produce industry.  That was one of the most transformational decisions ever made in this country, in terms of what we have earned from exports and job creation.

We need some form of portal through which an individual or company can find out what is available.  We have been hammering on about this for the past two years but there does not seem to be any action on it.  If we can do this by the end of the year it will be very beneficial.  The large organisation which supplies the man I spoke to last night did not know about JobsPlus.  We need to make it possible to access all the information through one portal and get the message out. <\/p><p>  Yesterday I was at the Kildare Enterprise student awards ceremony.

We had to box smart and roll up our sleeves to transform areas.  Exports have driven this transformation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has played a significant role in this regard.

I do not know whether tax strategies can be developed to deal with land hoarding.  A measure was introduced in this regard several years ago but it fell flat on its face within 18 months because it proved ineffective.  I am not trying to prejudice any new efforts but it is an issue that requires careful thought.<\/p><p>  On SME procurement, we propose a number of useful initiatives.  Processes will be piloted whereby contracting authorities can provide advice to tenderers in an attempt to resolve any issues that arise.  There is a sense that people are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  Circular 10\/2010, which is designed to give SMEs a fair crack of the whip, is being revised to take account of the new director of procurement and the potential for innovative approaches to procurement will be investigated on a pilot basis.  Three or four pilot schemes are being introduced in the procurement areas, and if they work this year, we will try to push them into something bigger next year.  We got our foot in the door in the procurement area this year.  In regard to the ESB's role in broadband provision, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has ambitions in that area.  We try to deliver the Ireland House concept wherever it is practical to do so.

The action plan for 2013 has delivered significantly and we clearly ought to build on its successes.  I welcome the Minister's comments in regard to regional strategies.  I come from a region that has suffered significant job losses over the past decade despite its location in the centre of Ireland and excellent access to broadband, public transport and building supply.  I would like to see a focus on towns such as Ballinasloe in trying to attract some of the significant job announcements into the regions.<\/p> <p> On the skill shortages, the Minister mentioned that many of our best and brightest are leaving, and many of them with some of the skills that we require at home.  What contribution does the income tax system make to some of our brightest leaving the country?  One hits the high tax rate at &euro;32,500.  Is that an issue?  Is that driving some of the soundings we heard from Government recently that this an area that will be looked at in future budgets?<\/p><p> On competitiveness, it is encouraging that we have improved our world ranking, from 24th in 2011 to 17th in 2013.  How will we be able to improve that competitiveness even further?  We all realise how significant a cost is energy to SMEs.  Are there are any opportunities in that area?<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Lawlor that we need to communicate better what is available to employers.  I wonder should a communication or flyer of some description be sent to every employer in the country, large and small.  It would not cost a great deal.  We all will be aware from our records of the businesses operating right throughout the country.  I accept that online information is useful, but it appears that those in business do not realise the basic information that one would expect them to have.  I have come across employers who do not know about the JobsPlus scheme and do not realise that an employer who takes on an extra person can get significant help towards employing him or her.  We need to look at that.<\/p><p> I support the concept of teaching entrepreneurship in second-level schools.  Recently, the Minister met a number of people from Ballinasloe who had an innovative idea of piloting a project and I hope that the Department might take that on board and see how it can be developed further.<\/p><p> On the staffing levels and resources of the LEOs, the city and county enterprise boards in some parts of the country have been poorly resourced.

We, on this side of the table, need to put a good deal of thought into it and we are starting that process.  I do not know in which quarter, but we are to produce a framework during the course of the year.  It will take a bit of work on our side and I would be interested in the committee's thinking on this.  It is definitely an area worth having a serious debate on - for instance examining how many visits are occurring, where is the competitive advantage in this area, what should we be targeting, how do we go after it and what would work.<\/p><p>  I have stated on a number of occasions that the low threshold at which one hits the high rate of tax here is not jobs friendly and we should seek to change it, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and others have said so.  There are push and pull factors in migration.  As far back as the 1920s, there was a report on migration.  I remember reading it all those years ago, although I was not around in the 1920s.  There are good opportunities for certain skills here, there are people coming in from overseas and then there are Irish people with those skills deciding to go elsewhere.  One wonders what is at play.  One of our commitments, under the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is that whereas two years ago 45% of the ICT skills were being met by Irish colleges we aim that by 2018 it will be 75%.  We are making a significant shift in ensuring that the young people coming out of our colleges are equipped for real areas of good opportunity.  That is our best response.<\/p><p>  On competitiveness, there is a significant number of areas of improvement.  This year we strengthened the National Competitive Council by adding six industrial partners, such as Ms Louise Phelan, Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Driscoll, Mr. Dave Shanahan and Ms Heather Reynolds from Eishtec.  We have put business people with sharp experience onto the National Competitive Council.  They will be reporting quarterly to the Cabinet jobs committee on what can be done in practical terms.<\/p><p>  Some of the competitive issues are within the reach of any of our units.  One of the issues I will be looking at is to improve our interplay with enterprise.  For instance, the Health and Safety Authority will be aiming to increase by 50% the number of companies which use its online tool to meet their health and safety requirements as this is much simpler and much cheaper.  If, in all our agencies, we can roll out such facilities, we will improve.<\/p><p>  There are particular competitive areas, such as the speed of planning and construction permits, in which we seem to be weak.  If we can look at those areas, we will identify where in the chain it is taking too much time.  Local authorities could act similarly.<\/p><p>  The issue of energy is a tricky one.  Science Foundation Ireland is undertaking a pilot research project in Ireland as a test bed to try to use the energy grid to get an advantage.  We are building out an all-island energy grid.  The question is whether we can turn that into a smart grid that gives us an advantage.  Allied to that, generally, energy conservation or energy efficiency is an area where there is probably untapped potential and there are schemes to support that.  In terms of pragmatic measures that we can take, that is probably the lowest hanging fruit with the highest return.<\/p><p>  When one gets into the cost of energy infrastructures, the problem is our fuel mix is not particularly good.  We are reliant on fossil fuels and their prices are only going one way.  Even though the shale gas has changed the position in the short term, prices are only going one way in the long term.<\/p><p>  In the short term, building out renewables is expensive.  It imposes costs on consumers.  There are real dilemmas in this area.  The expectation is if we can get to a lower carbon energy network, we will have a long-term competitive advantage even though in the short term it might not be so easy.  It is a real dilemma.<\/p><p>  I note in the recent EU report on this that areas that we do not tend to look at, such as the transmission and various add-on costs, are ones where the greatest growth in energy costs is being driven.  It is not from the fuel piece; it is from the add-ons.  Better management of the grid, such as its interconnection and the capacity to use cheaper fuels, is fairly important and, obviously, is easier to control than fuel prices.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullins is correct about communications and, maybe, we will get back to him.  We will ask the Companies Registration Office, CRO, if it has a capacity to get some of that information out or make it more accessible.  We are definitely keen to use every facility.<\/p><p>  On the local enterprise offices, we have committed to 120 staff.  The local authorities have committed to 50 staff.  In addition, the local authorities have agreed that there will be services equivalent to those of 40 additional staff, for example, the partial service of a planning officer who would be available to advise businesses.<\/p> <p>This is an increased resource.  We have also received permission to take on some graduates to facilitate this work.  We feel that, overall, these resources will beef up what is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400014#O00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393962600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions, just to add to the Minister's problems.  I congratulate him and his team on the excellent process that is Action Plan for Jobs.  It has turned around how work is done across all Departments.  That we are on the third plan and have gone from 250 actions in the first to nearly 400 in this one proves that they are working.  The percentage success rate each year is in the high 90s.  I compliment the Minister and his team, as they have had a role in that.  It is appreciated, as our job is easier if we have something to aim for by the end of the year.  I assume that the same logic applies in every Department.  It is easy to follow what must be done and by whom.  It is a good system.<br \/>Naturally, we are glad to see some of our recommendations making their way into the plan.  It is important that these issues, be they highlighted to us at our meetings or raised by others, be implemented.  We view our committee as a forum to discuss issues that can then be passed up the line.<br \/>I have written down the Minister's comment about his Department using its own channels and agencies to convey the information.  However, every company deals with Revenue on a monthly, if not weekly, basis.  Every e-mail that we receive from the Department of Health or the HSE contains a little message at the bottom about some health initiative it is undertaking, for example, eating healthily, breastfeeding, etc.  A simple message could be sent via Revenue or the companies office suggesting that people check out JobsPlus, etc.  A tag line at the bottom should not cost much.  Companies are under so much pressure that they do not have time to stop and think.  Even this committee might not know about all of the Department's schemes.  Companies should be targeted.  We must use other agencies - for example, companies are members of the chambers and so on - to get messages about the various schemes out there.  The Minister has gone to a lot of effort to make this particular scheme simpler and easier to use.  The missing element is how to drive the message home.<br \/>A prime example is the family income supplement, FIS, although it does not relate to the Minister's Department.  We are nearly keeping it a secret, as if we do not want people using it.  It is the solution to the gap that many people are trying to close.  Getting it can be complicated and the process can be slow, but we can consider that issue.  Most people do not know it exists.  Perhaps that is on purpose, but we should be pushing this solution.<br \/>Many of the airwaves are taken up by companies claiming that they cannot fill vacancies that are not for high-skilled jobs.  We cannot blame people for this.  Their families' safety nets are their social welfare entitlements.  They are afraid to lose them.  This situation is down to misinformation, in that people are being told that they will lose out and that it will take six months to get their entitlements back.  We need to do something to close that gap.  This is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection, but the Minister's Department also has a role to play.  If companies cannot find employees for jobs that are easily fillable, it poses a difficulty.  We must try to fight this battle.<br \/>We have JobsPlus and so on to encourage the employment of people in receipt of social welfare payments, but such people are afraid to leave their entitlements.  Housing assistance will begin in July, but perhaps the simplest approach would be to tell people that they can keep their medical cards and everything else for three months after starting work.  The fear is that their jobs might not suit them or <i>vice versa<\/i>and they must return to social welfare in one or two months time.  In some offices, though, getting back on the system is difficult.  I accept that, in some offices, the process is straightforward and people can hop on and hop off, but that is not the case everywhere.  Will the Minister raise this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton?  Staying on the system for an extra three months will not break the system.<br \/>Last week, we discussed the failure rate with Mr. Sean O'Sullivan and Ireland's perception of failure.  I have often encountered this in the agencies under the Minister's aegis, in that they may be afraid of having too many failures on their books, be they the microenterprise loan fund, the enterprise boards or so on.  If we do not want a certain amount of failure, it means we are not doing our jobs right because we are not giving people a chance.  I have seen some of the agencies' refusals.  For example, the microenterprise loan fund is afraid to give &euro;15,000 to a company in case it fails.  We must take a whole-of-government approach.  If someone is given a loan of &euro;15,000, it gets him or her out of the social welfare system for a year.  The taxpayer has not lost if the company goes down the Swanee.  I encourage a different approach to grant aid, particularly if entrepreneurs are in receipt of social welfare payments.  The two Departments could work together.  The State will not lose if we give someone a chance for a year, even if we believe that he or she might fail.  The same money is being spent, but by a different Department.  It is not the end of the world.  We are supposed to have joined-up thinking, but I have still not seen it in some of the agencies.  People are doing their jobs right, ticking the boxes and being cautious with taxpayers' money.  Joined-up thinking is missing in some cases.<br \/>In every agency and support system, red tape can get in the way of common sense and keep someone from getting help, losing us a potential jobs opportunity.  This is the greatest shame.  Red tape has replaced common sense too often.  We must change those systems.  Perhaps the Minister should advise his staff on what is an acceptable failure rate.  He may have done so already, but I sense the agencies' fear of failing.  We must move on.<br \/>We have the solutions.  It is just a matter of getting the message out there, driven by the right person.  At a lower level, the two Departments need to work together to get some people off the system and to give them a chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014030400015#P00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1393962600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his acknowledgement.

When we first came together as a committee we dealt with three Departments and everyone thought that somewhere along the line we could crack some of these obvious issues.  One of the most obvious instances is where a person wants to go to college but is not two years out of the system.  He or she is not allowed to get the back-to-education allowance but is allowed to stay on social welfare.  The money is the same but one must sit at home for another six months in order to qualify for the college course.  Those are the little things that the committee has discovered.  There is no extra cost involved so we wonder why we cannot get over the matter.

Ach mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair post a fh&aacute;il.  Mar sin, caitheann clanna c&uacute;pla m&iacute;le euro chun oideachas maith a shol&aacute;thar d&aacute; bp&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Chomh maith le sin, b&iacute;onn orthu airgead a chaitheamh ar chostais bia, leabhar agus &aacute;it ch&oacute;naithe. Ach an chun a bheith ag f&eacute;achaint ar a leanbh a bheith caite siar sa chathaoir agus ina ch&oacute;na&iacute; sa bhaile mar nach bhfuil aon airgid aige chun teach a leas&uacute; a chaitheann siad an t-airgead sin?<\/p><p>  Gach l&aacute; feictear m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ag streachailt chun post a fh&aacute;il agus ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil poist ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Ach i mo scoil, bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-deacair m&uacute;inteoir Fraincise a fh&aacute;il.  Chomh maith le sin, &oacute;n taighde a rinne m&eacute;, fuair m&eacute; amach go raibh 200 post ar f&aacute;il in &Eacute;irinn do dhaoine at&aacute; &aacute;balta Gearm&aacute;inis a labhairt.

Mar thoradh ar an easpa airgid sa tseirbh&iacute;s sl&aacute;inte, bh&iacute; embargo i bhfeidhm go dt&iacute; c&uacute;pla m&iacute; &oacute; shin.  De bharr an embargo sin, n&iacute;or fhosta&iacute;odh aon teiripeoir urlabhra agus teanga le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas.

I welcome the opportunity to brief them on discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council in the first part of 2014.<\/p><p>  It has been a busy two months, not least in light of ongoing developments in Ukraine.  I propose to address this issue first, before updating the joint committee on the many other important issues that have featured on the Council&rsquo;s agenda since the beginning of year. <\/p><p>  As I stated after yesterday&rsquo;s extraordinary session of the Foreign Affairs Council, what is happening in Crimea is the worst crisis which Europe has faced since the end of the Cold War.  I have strongly condemned Russia&rsquo;s actions over the weekend and call on it to immediately withdraw troops to their barracks.  Russia&rsquo;s actions are in clear breach of international law and of its obligations to respect Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  I have just come from a meeting with the Russian ambassador to Ireland in which I expressed our condemnation of Russia&rsquo;s actions in Crimea, and requested that Ambassador Peshkov convey Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern to his government.<\/p><p>  The EU wants to see a peaceful solution to the current crisis and stands ready to engage in talks with all parties to resolve this crisis.  We will work with the United Nations and the OSCE to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this dangerous situation.  However, at yesterday&rsquo;s emergency Council, the EU sent a very strong message to Russia.  If the Russian authorities do not de-escalate this crisis, the EU will take consequential action, including suspending talks on visa liberalisation and on a new economic agreement, both of which are priorities for the Russian Government.  Foreign ministers will continue to monitor this situation closely and we stand ready to implement further targeted measures as necessary. <\/p><p>  It is worth recalling that it was the announcement on 21 November by Ukraine&rsquo;s President Yanukovych, of his decision to postpone preparations for the signature of the association agreement at November&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, that triggered major protests in Ukraine late last year.  The initial protests were overwhelmingly peaceful yet were met just over a week later by heavy-handed police action which only served to inflame the situation.<\/p><p>  The issue has featured prominently in the agendas and conclusions of successive Foreign Affairs Councils this year including at emergency Council sessions devoted to Ukraine on 20 February and again yesterday.  I believe that it was right for the Council to convene in extraordinary sessions, given last month&rsquo;s violent clashes between protestors and security forces, which resulted in so many deaths, coupled with the deeply disturbing developments in Crimea since last weekend. <\/p><p>  The situation remains extremely dangerous though thankfully there are no reports of armed clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces thus far.  As I made clear to Ambassador Peshkov a short time ago, there is an urgent need for Moscow to de-escalate the situation.  <\/p><p>  At yesterday&rsquo;s emergency Foreign Affairs Council we adopted conclusions strongly condemning the violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty by the Russian armed forces, as well as the authorisation given by the Federation Council of Russia on 1 March for the use of the armed forces on the territory of Ukraine.  We agreed that these actions are in clear breach of the UN Charter and the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, as well as of Russia's specific commitments to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the bilateral Treaty on Friendship, Co-operation and Partnership of 1997. <\/p><p>  We called on Russia to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the areas of their permanent stationing, in accordance with the Agreement on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet stationing on the territory of Ukraine of 1997.  We also commended the Government in Kiev on the measured response demonstrated so far in the face of this provocation.<\/p><p>  As we have made clear from the beginning, the EU stands ready to facilitate a political settlement in Ukraine that is democratic, lasting and fulfils the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people.  However, it is ultimately a matter for the people of Ukraine to decide on their own future and they should be enabled to do so without external pressure.  The organisation of democratic elections in May, which are transparent, free and fair, will provide them with an opportunity to make that decision.<\/p><p>  We continue to monitor the evolving situation.  The risk of all-out conflict in Crimea, and Ukraine as a whole, is real.  I believe that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest, including that of Russia, to do everything possible to step back and take de-escalating measures.  It is fundamental that Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity, unity and independence be fully respected.  The European Council has been convened for Thursday of this week to consider the matter further.  We had the opportunity to review EU-Russia relations at the January Council, in preparation for the EU-Russia Summit which was held later that month in Brussels.<\/p> <p>Inevitably, the issue of Russian pressure on Ukraine and other counties, including some EU member states, featured prominently in discussion.<\/p><p> The summit of 28 January was held in a more compact format than usual and focused on common interests as well as divergences, with discussion characterised afterwards by President Van Rompuy as open and frank.  While noting that the EU's co-operation with Russia spans a wide range of global issues, he underlined, in particular, the benefits of the Eastern Partnership for all of our eastern neighbours, including Russia.  The EU relationship with Russia is clearly in crisis as a direct consequence of Moscow's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity at the weekend, an act which I have already condemned.  Developments in respect of Ukraine will continue to have a defining influence on our relations with Russia in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p> More generally, on 10 February the Foreign Affairs Council reviewed developments in respect of the Eastern Partnership following the Vilnius summit in November last year.  My colleagues and I agreed that it must be made clear to Ukraine that it still has the possibility to sign the Association Agreement when they are ready to do so. For the moment, the task in front of the EU is to sign the association agreements when it is ready to do so.  For now, the task ahead of the EU is to sign the association agreements that were initialled at Vilnius with Georgia and Moldova.  Ireland and a number of other EU member states have said that these agreements should be signed and provisionally applied as soon as possible and in any event by August at the latest.  There is an expectation that in the run-up to signing both countries will come under economic and political pressure from Russia not to sign the association agreements but instead to join the Russian-led Customs Union.  The EU believes that Georgia and Moldova should be free to make their own political and economic choices and will consider practical ways to assist them in doing so.<\/p><p> As members would expect, the Middle East and north Africa have continued to occupy a great deal of the Council's attention in recent months and will again figure prominently on its agenda for March.  The appalling conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria continues to be a major preoccupation for the EU and its member states and is addressed on a virtually ongoing basis by the Council.  Strong conclusions addressing the humanitarian situation, expressing the EU's full support for the Geneva II negotiations and strongly condemning the escalating violence and the regime's indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, were adopted in January.  The January conclusions also contain a clear call on the UN Security Council to adopt a long-proposed resolution on the humanitarian situation, aimed at putting pressure on all sides, but particularly the Assad regime, to remove all obstacles to the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance.  Having long called for such action, I very much welcome the fact that on 22 February the Security Council adopted a strongly worded resolution - UNSCR 2139 - which makes absolutely clear the obligations and duties on all sides to end violence and attacks on civilians and allow immediate and unhindered access for humanitarian agencies.  I welcome the Council's expressed intention to take further steps if the necessary compliance is not forthcoming from any party to the conflict.  What is now crucial is that the terms of the resolution be fully implemented and complied with by all sides involved in the conflict.  On the political track, two rounds of negotiations within the Geneva II framework have now taken place though, unfortunately, with very little progress achieved to date.  Joint special representative Brahimi is due to brief the Security Council in the coming days on the prospects for convening a third round of negotiations in the near future.  This is also likely to be a major topic of discussion at the March Council.<\/p><p> It would have been unrealistic to expect any kind of quick progress or major breakthrough after just two rounds, given the vast gulf which continues to divide the two sides.  I would, therefore, continue to urge the need for patience, as well as encouraging those with influence on either side to press for more constructive engagement, particularly on the part of the regime.  The reality remains that Geneva II continues to be the only show in town as far as a political resolution of the conflict is concerned.<\/p><p> The Middle East peace process was briefly discussed by the Council in January and is due to be further considered at its March meeting.  US Secretary of State John Kerry is continuing his valuable efforts to draft a framework which will allow the negotiations between the two sides to continue beyond the current scheduled end date of 30 April.  Prime Minister Netanyahu held important discussions yesterday, 3 March, with President Obama on the framework document.  President Abbas is also due to visit Washington and meet President Obama in the coming weeks.  Secretary of State Kerry continues to enjoy the full support of Ireland and all our EU partners for his efforts.  It is to be earnestly hoped that a balanced framework document, which will allow the negotiations to continue and work towards that comprehensive peace agreement, based on the two-State solution, which we all so passionately wish to see achieved, can be agreed in the coming weeks.  The Council has already made clear, in conclusions adopted last December, that the EU is prepared to offer an unprecedented package of political, economic and security support in the event of a final peace agreement.  Some internal thought is taking place within the Council as to whether it would be beneficial for the EU to elaborate further on what such a privileged partnership for both states might entail.  For our part, Ireland is happy to work with partners on this, so long as it remains clearly understood that this offer is clearly premised on a comprehensive and final peace agreement being in place.<\/p><p> I am also continuing to strongly make the case within Council that the EU must prepare for all possible contingencies in respect of the current talks process, as well as addressing the actual situation on the ground which, regrettably, is not improving.  In particular, Israel has continued to announce plans for settlement expansion in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  Such announcements actively work against and undermine the current peace efforts and are not in any way consistent with a genuine commitment to achieve a just and permanent negotiated peace.  I again call on the Israeli Government to review and rescind any such recent announcements and seriously consider a freeze on further settlement expansion as a potentially invaluable contribution to the current peace efforts.<\/p><p> The Council has also addressed the wider Middle East and southern neighbourhood region at its January and February meetings, including the serious regional impact of the Syria conflict on countries such as Lebanon and Iraq.  The Council adopted conclusions on Iraq at its February meeting and expressed strong concern at the deteriorating security situation in the country, partly attributable to the Syria conflict, and urging Iraq's political and religious leaders to increase efforts to promote internal dialogue and reconciliation in advance of crucial parliamentary elections in April.  The Council also reviewed recent developments in Egypt at its February meeting following the adoption of a new constitution in January.  Egypt remains a key regional partner for the EU and it is important to do all we can to assist the Egyptian people as they continue their difficult transition away from the authoritarian past to a hopefully more democratic future.  The Council made clear the EU's continuing concern about the deteriorating human rights situation within Egypt and the use of selective justice against the political opposition.  The EU remains fully committed, through the High Representative's sustained engagement, to doing all it can to promote greater political dialogue and reconciliation within the country which remains absolutely necessary if Egypt is to resume a sustainable path to greater democracy and prosperity.<\/p><p> More positively, the Council also welcomed last month the recent political progress achieved in both Tunisia and Yemen, which offers real encouragement to all those countries in the wider region undergoing a process of political transition.  In particular, the adoption of a new constitution in January represents a real and historic achievement for the Tunisian people and demonstrates the benefits which can follow when confrontation is avoided in favour of dialogue and compromise.  Similarly, the Yemeni Government and people are to be applauded on the conclusion of their national dialogue which will hopefully now lead to a new constitution and elections in the coming months.<\/p><p> Iran was also briefly discussed by the Council in January, at which time High Representative Ashton reported on the agreement on implementation of the joint plan of action arising from the interim deal on Iran's nuclear programme negotiated in Geneva last November.  Under that plan, Iran has been granted a limited amount of sanctions relief in exchange for freezing and, in some areas, rowing back on its nuclear and enrichment activities which have given rise to such international concern.  The Council for its part formally approved the necessary amendments to the EU sanctions regime arising from the interim deal.  Negotiations have now begun in Vienna on transforming the interim deal into a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear programme, hopefully to be concluded by July.  These are vital negotiations which High Representative continues to lead on behalf of the E3+3 and are fully deserving of all our support, although it is also necessary not to underestimate the considerable difficulties which still lie ahead for all involved.<\/p><p> Developments in Africa have also been a focus of discussions at the recent Council meetings.  In January, Ministers discussed the continuing escalation of violence in the Central African Republic and - building on the December Council conclusions - agreed, in principle, to deploy a mission in support of the African Union-led peacekeeping operation.  A special ministerial meeting on the humanitarian needs in the Central African Republic was held in Brussels on the same day as the Foreign Affairs Council and it was attended by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Costello.  Subsequently, the February Council adopted conclusions establishing the EU military operation in the Central African Republic, the aim of which is to contribute to a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area for up to six months, with a view to handing over to African partners.<\/p> <p>The EU also welcomed the formation of a new transitional authority in the Central African Republic and reiterated the EU's commitment to support it in its efforts to implement the transition agreement, restore public order and meet the needs of the population.<\/p><p>  At our January meeting, the Council adopted detailed conclusions on the worsening situation in South Sudan.  In particular, we underlined the EU&rsquo;s support for the peace talks that are being led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and we called on all parties to agree an immediate cessation to hostilities and violence.  Given the worsening humanitarian and security situation across many parts of the country we urged all political and military leaders to protect the population and to act in the interests of the South Sudanese people as a whole. <\/p><p> At its next meeting on 17 March, the Council will consider the broader EU-Africa relationship, in advance of the EU-Africa summit which is due to take place in Brussels on 2 and 3 April. <\/p><p> At our meeting in January, we had a strategic discussion on Afghanistan, focused on how best the EU can support international efforts to assist the Afghan people in making the transition to a peaceful democratic state, based on respect for human rights.   Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s commitment to continued engagement in Afghanistan post-2014, as set out in the conclusions adopted at the January Council.  We expect to see ethical, free and fair elections in April of this year and urge Afghanistan to implement the commitments it entered into at the Tokyo conference last year to improve economic and political governance. <\/p><p> We briefly discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina at our meeting on 10 February, in light of the public demonstrations taking place there.  Those demonstrations have been continuing and people have now formed citizens' plenums in major cities to better articulate their views.  They are focused on issues such as the state of the economy, widespread corruption, the lack of progress towards EU membership and the inaction of Bosnia&rsquo;s political leaders and institutions.  The EU has consistently encouraged the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to work together to address the needs of their citizens.  This is a message that my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, delivered very clearly when he visited Sarajevo at the end of January.  We will be discussing developments in Bosnia Herzegovina and the EU&rsquo;s strategy again at the March Council. <\/p><p> That concludes my overview of discussions at the most recent Council meetings.  As always, I would be more than happy to answer any questions the members may have and I look forward to hearing their perspectives on the many foreign policy challenges that we face. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400003#E00400","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393951800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his detailed statement.

I am known at this committee to have dissented somewhat from the popular views that have been expressed here to the effect that Tymoshenko was the hero of Ukraine, that she was the greatest democrat that existed, she is one of ours and therefore let us run with her.<\/p><p>  I concur with the T&aacute;naiste's condemnation of the role Russia has played.  There are very dangerous tendencies in being selective with the truth.  I am not impressed by the efforts of the diplomatic corps in the EU to date and I believe they rushed in in terms of the situation in Ukraine.  They did not take due cognisance of the vast number of Russian-speaking Ukrainians.  Yanukovych would have gone in the next election.  The people in the east and in the west of Ukraine were going to oust him in any case not because he was pro-Russian or anti-European but because he has ruined the economy of Ukraine.  The tragic consequences of what is happening is that regardless of who wins the minds of the people of Ukraine, they are in a desperate situation financially and the Russians will not be able to resolve that on their own and neither will Europe.  <\/p><p>  I suggest that the West, particularly the European Union, should be very cautious of the people who are out there on the ground and coming in from various parts of the world to advice the Ukrainians on how to run their affairs.  I note that Mikheil Saakashvili, the former President of Georgia, has been out there advising.  This is similar to the Bertie Aherns of this world going around the world telling people how to build a tiger economy.  Thankfully, he was rightfully ousted by the people of Georgia but not before he made catastrophic political decisions which resulted in the troops coming in from Russia who could have gone on to Tbilisi.  I also note, and the T&aacute;naiste might comment on this, that the former chancellor, Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, said that Ukraine could live with both an association agreement and the customs union agreement - that there is no need to be that competitive about the types of the development that would occur in Ukraine.<\/p><p>  I fear that the media, both in the West and in the East, have been playing to their own audiences.<\/p> <p>It worries me no end that what is happening now is largely as a result of black propaganda that has extended throughout Ukraine from the east right across the country.  However, I do not believe the Western press paid any serious consideration to those forces operating out of Kiev that called at the barricades for every man with a licensed gun to come to the square and take on the Government.  In what I argue is an important issue, I do not believe the West really played any serious role in identifying the Right Sector and the role it played.  While it was a human tragedy that the riot police killed so many people, prior to that I had not heard anyone in the West condemn those who shot members of the riot police in advance of the big vicious massacre, when at least eight to 12 police officers were murdered by gunshots at the barricades.<\/p><p> I will conclude by noting the West quite rightly always sought the release of Ms Tymoshenko.  On her release, the lady in question appeared at the barricades, notwithstanding the fact that the Parliament was in session and was trying to get people to desist at the barricades and to wind down the campaign there because the parliamentarians wished to enter into negotiations about the future of Ukraine.  However, she went to the barricades, where her first public statement was for people to continue to man the barricades.  I consider that to have been quite irresponsible and do not think this lady or her party are contributing in any way to the stability of Ukraine.  God help Ukraine if she should ever became the President, which she will not.<\/p><p> What to me appears most disturbing is that on the day on which Yanukovych abdicated, the Parliament, now deemed to be pro-Western, reversed an important public policy on the use of not only the Russian language but also the languages of the minorities.  This was a complete affront to the Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think the aforementioned pro-Western Parliament did the right thing by issuing, immediately on seizing power, a reversal of a policy in which the regions could have recognition for a second language?  This affected languages other than the Russian language, including Hungarian and perhaps others.  My worry about Ukraine is the west of the country is playing far too much to its Western audience and has neglected the vast Russian-speaking area of the country.  I hope peace returns because as matters stand, there is now a deep wedge between the people in the east and the west of Ukraine.  I wonder whether we in the West handled it properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400005#G00400","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393952400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I have a number of points to make.  First, in respect of the condemnation, I believe it is supported by all parties in this House.  The next question is, what comes next?  People are talking about the need to punish Russia and the T&aacute;naiste is contemplating possible sanctions in that regard.  Will there be agreement right across the European Union on such sanctions?  Will it come to that?  While one is working off scraps of information being picked up here and there, it appears as though there are extremists on both sides, that is, both pro-Russian and pro-European.  One party, which I believe is called Svoboda, was involved in the activities on the square, in the pro-European Union calls and so on.  However, its leader, who supported the pro-European Union protests, has called for the elimination of political and democratic pluralism in Ukraine, for ethnic cleansing of the entire country and for the restoration of the status of Ukraine as a nuclear power.  In addition, I have heard no one discussing the anti-Semitic attacks.  The rabbi of Kiev has suggested that people from a Jewish background should leave Kiev because of what is happening on the ground there but no one appears to be expressing concern in this regard.<br \/>Everyone accepts that Crimea always has been of strategic importance and I do not believe the Russians will ever pull out of Crimea.  I note other countries have invaded countries that are thousands of miles from their own country while stating it is in their own backyard and similarly, the Russians view Crimea as their backyard.  We got ourselves into a zero-sum situation, that is, Ukrainians could either go with the European Union or with the Russians.  There did not appear to be any sort of in-between point in that regard.  Does the T&aacute;naiste now accept that on reflection, this was the wrong position into which to try to push the Ukrainians?  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that people need to pull back from this and there must be discussions with the Russians on how this situation will be resolved?  Is the T&aacute;naiste worried about the potential of young men, regardless of whether they are Russian, pro-Russian or pro-western and how it only requires a few shots to be fired and a couple more people to be killed and one will have a conflagration in the entire region?  My major concern is this is what will happen.<br \/>Was the issue of anti-Semitism discussed at the emergency meeting?  Will it form part of the focus in respect of the present difficulties?  What was the majority view on the meeting?  While the T&aacute;naiste is talking about possible sanctions and so on, realistically, can countries that have huge ties with the Russian economy survive the imposition of sanctions regarding oil, gas or trade?  I do not believe it would be so simple and I seek answers in this regard because I do not know what is the best solution.  The statement issued in this regard stated:<blockquote>The EU is ready to further pursue its efforts with the international community and international financial institutions, especially the IMF, to assist Ukraine.  To this end, the EU and its Member States will lend their full support to an international assistance package to address the urgent needs of Ukraine.<\/blockquote>I seek confirmation from the T&aacute;naiste on any aid or financial support given to Ukraine.  As the Russians have offered a similar package, is it possible that the European Union and the Russians could come together and come up with some form of solution?  I refer to the bartering agreements and the &euro;13 billion the Russians had proposed to wipe off the debt and so on.<br \/>Is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about the other countries in the region, some of which are within the European Union, that have significant Russian populations?  Is the T&aacute;naiste worried this contagion could spread to other countries?  Is he concerned there will be similar protests in those countries that have huge Russian populations?  Difficulties exist in many of those countries, in that if one is Russian or Russian-speaking, one is more likely to be unemployed or to be poorer than one's Ukrainian counterpart and this pattern also extends to some of the European Union member states.  Difficulties exist on how they are being treated, which in itself creates conflict.<br \/>I will turn to some of the other issues mentioned by the T&aacute;naiste.  On the Palestinian situation, the T&aacute;naiste spoke of the discussions with the Israelis.  In a major development in 2013, the British and Dutch Governments recently provided advice to their private sectors, warning them of the risks of having commercial investment links with the Israeli settlements.  Does the T&aacute;naiste intend to provide similar advice to Irish companies?<\/p> <p>It came up when we had representatives from Tr&oacute;caire here last week.  The head of Tr&oacute;caire could not understand why similar advice had not been issued concerning Irish businesses.  <\/p><p> Given the T&aacute;naiste's support for an EU-wide ban on settlement products, will he be using the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council meeting to push for Council conclusions on this matter?<\/p><p> Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that the Geneva-2 talks on Syria have progressed anything?  Can those talks be built upon?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste also referred to Libya, so what plans does the EU have to support the development of democracy, peace and commerce there?  On Sunday last, the Libyan Parliament was stormed by armed rioters who set fire to the grounds and looted furniture, as well as wounding a prominent lawmaker.  The situation seems to be getting worse there.<\/p><p> I am glad the T&aacute;naiste pointed out the positive developments that have happened in Tunisia and Yemen.<\/p><p> I have raised the question of Afghanistan with the T&aacute;naiste previously.  The poppy-field acreage has quadrupled there in the last three years, but was this matter discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council?  Are there any talks on working with other countries in the region to prevent the heroin by-product arriving in Europe, including in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400006#H00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393953000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming here today, although I know he is very busy at the moment.

There has been a lot of discussion about whether Tymoshenko or Yanukovych is the better democrat, but that is not really our business.  To the extent that we are involved, our business is to ensure that the people of Ukraine can make a decision without external pressure.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe touched on a point that has some validity - the fact that, to an extent, we are contributing to the polarisation of people there who must either look east or west.  There is perhaps no consideration of the genuine tensions that exist within the country.  People say that they now have no choice but to look east because of their huge debt.  Ukraine's debt is approximately &euro;34 billion but we paid that for one bank.  In order to stop a war, it would not be beyond the possibility of the rest of the world to come up with that sum.  The real inhibiting factor is the long-term supply of oil which informs the views of Russia, Ukraine and, let us face it, ourselves as well.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste said it was still open to the Ukrainians to sign the association agreement.  Is it realistic at this stage, however, to expect them to make such a decision, given the hell-fire that rained down on them as a result of making a decision not to sign it?  <\/p><p>  Is it realistic for countries like Georgia to feel that it is in their interests to sign an agreement with Europe, which effectively means turning their back on Russia?

Did he indicate that we are likely to see a de-escalation of activities in Crimea?<\/p><p>  In his statement, the T&aacute;naiste said that if there was not a de-escalation the EU would take serious actions.  What are those actions likely to be and what impact will sanctions have for various EU member states?  Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to various association agreements.  Are they unlikely to be signed now, considering the significant pressure that Russia will obviously exert on Georgia and Moldova?<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste described the situation in Ukraine as the worst crisis since the Cold War, but the worst humanitarian crisis since then is the appalling situation in Syria.  Did the T&aacute;naiste discuss that crisis with the Russian ambassador?  It was most appropriate to call the Russian ambassador in to discuss recent developments, but should he not also have been called in to discuss his country's strong support for the awful and sad regime in Syria?<\/p><p>  There have been no more Srebrenicas or Rwandas, but the situation in Syria is heading in that direction with 8,000 people a day fleeing across borders.

Does the T&aacute;naiste feel that we are not seeing the same type of public outrage that we should see in this case?

In this case, it strikes me that at EU level we need to examine at what stage the protest crosses the threshold to become a coup.  Members of this committee were in Cairo at the time of the protests there and we unanimously referred to the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi as a coup.  I am concerned that some parameters are needed because the implications of this could be very serious.<\/p><p>  It looks as if the withdrawal of Russian troops to barracks is at least a de-escalating step, which is what the EU called for in recent days.  If the Russian army had moved into Ukraine, I do not think it would have been prevented from doing so militarily.  There would have been a reaction by way of sanctions, however.<\/p><p>  In these scenarios, we need to be careful that we are not encouraging people - although I am not saying that that happened - to go further in protests than they should go.  In so far as any elected government or president becomes unpopular, that should change through the ballot box.<\/p> <p>Given the history of Crimea and its fundamental importance to the Russian fleet for access to the Black Sea, it should have been anticipated that there would be a strong reaction from Russia in the event of its perceived interests being put at risk.  I listened to many of the comments made.  I read a report that Chancellor Merkel phoned President Putin on Sunday last.  I do not know if it was spoken about at the Council meeting, but it appears to have paved the way for some common thread to address this together.  There is a Russian interest.  There is a very significant Russian population and a Russian-speaking population.  There is also the risk and implications of spillover.  People have mentioned the Baltic countries and the Caucasus where there are very significant Russian populations.  There is a real need for greater engagement with the Russian authorities to ensure we do not get to these kinds of situations which can become flash points.  If someone makes a wrong decision, it can be very difficult to retreat.  To date, comments from the EU in particular have been helpful and encouraging in terms of resolving the matter through negotiation, which I welcome.<\/p><p> A question was asked about our reliance on Russian oil and gas for our energy needs.  That is significant leverage of which Russia will be as aware as us.  There is a great deal of trade in both directions and, as such, it could be quite damaging to have an impasse and a regime of sanctions between Russia and Europe.  I heard someone mention that Holland exports approximately five times the amount of imports it receives from Russia.  It is a very significant economic player.  While I am critical of some of the things that have happened in Russia, there is a need to recognise that Russia is a very significant country for Europe's well-being as much as it is for many central Asian and eastern European countries.<\/p><p> I move on to Palestine.  The joint committee previously adopted a motion approving a ban on the import of settlement goods into the European Union.  We had a report at our meeting last week to the effect that a couple of countries, including Holland, had moved to impose restrictions on importations of settlement goods.  I said then that we should explore with the T&aacute;naiste the possibility of Ireland and other member states taking that initiative.  It will be very difficult to get unanimity, but if a significant number of countries adopt the initiative, it will become a pressure point and assist with the negotiations which are under way.  It is interesting that President Obama is reported as having said in the last couple of days that if there is a failure to reach agreement in the current talks, he sees Israel standing on its own.  Presumably, that implies the USA will play its part in endeavouring to ensure that there will be agreement.  That is very important as it has not always been the case in respect of American foreign policy.<\/p><p> On 5 February 2014, the EU Parliament consented to EU member states ratifying the arms trade treaty.  It is now a matter for the Council of Ministers to make a formal decision.  The Minister has been very supportive as has the Government generally and the joint committee.  At what stage is the matter within the Council of Ministers and can the decision be expedited?  In the context of many of the conflicts we discuss at the joint committee, it is undoubtedly the case that the illegal trade in arms is a very significant contributory factor to the humanitarian issues we see around us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400007#J00400","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393953600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the United Nations and the OSCE working together to facilitate a peaceful resolution.

My only point would be in defence of Yulia Tymoshenko, on whose behalf I have put down numerous parliamentary questions over the last number of years, which is that she was in prison.  She will not have been exhilarated that she was kept in prison for so long, which might account for some of her reaction on her release.  That is understandable, albeit it may not have been the wisest thing to do.  She had a great deal of time to think in prison and there were no preferred charges or proper trial.<\/p><p>  Many countries which have had an association with Russia over the years - the Baltic and communist bloc countries generally - still have a resentment for ills that were never addressed during a regime of 50 years.  It is quite an amount of resentment and it does not go away.  It is very difficult to explain to those outside how deep that resentment goes, but it is there.  I remember once asking someone in one of those countries about why the Russian minority did not receive fair treatment.  The person replied \"My father was taken prisoner in 1942 and was never seen again\".  That was typical of countless experiences.  It is not by way of explanation but rather to try to understand the situation.  While Russia is a large and powerful country and a significant trading block with a huge population, there are also consequences for Russia, as the T&aacute;naiste has said.  It cannot because of its power and strength decide to ignore what would normally be regarded as the democratic expression of views and opinions in the ordinary way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400008#K00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1393953600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I have to leave in a few minutes to take the Chair in the D&aacute;il and apologise to the Chairman and T&aacute;naiste.

Rather than to go through each contribution individually, I will respond thematically.<\/p><p>  I start with Ukraine and Russia, rolling back a little to 2009 when the EU embarked on the eastern partnership process with six states on the borders of the Union.  It is not fair to say that progress towards association agreements has been rushed over the intervening five year period.  The process has taken its course.  There were hopes that an association agreement would be signed with Armenia.  Something similar to the occurrence in Ukraine happened in the case of Armenia where the President decided overnight to go with the customs union.  The association agreement was shelved.  Considerable progress was made in Ukraine, which was not completed.  I remember being at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in early November when we discussed the association agreement and the expectation then was that it would be signed at the Vilnius summit at the end of that month.  Then-President Yanukovych decided he was abandoning the association agreement and going with the customs union.  It is a pity the association agreement and customs union were seen to comprise a zero-sum exercise.  The development of the six states involved, including Ukraine, ought to be considered to benefit Russia, the European Union and, in particular, the people of those states.<\/p> <p>Having good economic relations with Russia and the European Union is to its advantage.  That is why I say the issue of the association agreement is still on the table.  The critical point is that the decision on whether to sign the association agreement is one that should be made by Ukraine which should not be subject to external influence or pressure.  The European Union is not applying external pressure and nobody else should do so either.  <\/p><p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe has referred to the fact that some very unpleasant individuals and forces became involved in the protests that followed the decision not to sign the association agreement.  We must be very clear in distinguishing between the perfectly legitimate right of people to protest, make their views known and call for a change of government and the exploitation of these protests by violent and anti-democratic forces.  That has complicated the situation in Ukraine.  That said, there was no justification for the use of force by the Ukrainian authorities at the time in effectively shooting people in the square during the protests.  There are issues that must be addressed in Ukraine, but they can be addressed by means other than the use or threatened use of military force.  <\/p><p> A number of colleagues have mentioned the situation in Crimea.  Deputy Brendan Smith asked about reports that 16,000 Russian soldiers were in Crimea.  I understand the forces are mixed and that they also include Russian naval personnel based in the naval base in Crimea.  I do not believe there is any independent confirmation of the numbers involved.  I had this discussion with the Russian ambassador.  One looks at a situation and sees Russian soldiers at various installations.  Fair enough, the Black Sea fleet is based in Crimea, but my view and that of the Government and the European Union is that the place for Russian soldiers is in their barracks.  I know that statements were made overnight that soldiers would be withdrawn to base.  <\/p><p> Deputy Brendan Smith asked me to set out what a diplomatic solution would look like.  There are a number of dimensions to it.  One is progressing to elections, which was part of the 21 February agreement brokered by the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France and Poland.  The second is economic and financial.  Ukraine has serious economic and financial difficulties and I am aware that discussions are taking place in Kiev involving the IMF and the European Commission.  I do not want to get into the details because I do not think it would be appropriate to do so, but, clearly, there is an issue of financial and economic support that comes into play.  <\/p><p> The third issue that comes into play is a perfectly legitimate one.  It concerns the rights of Russian speakers and different nationalities within Ukraine.  Deputy Eric Byrne asked what I thought of the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament on the Russian language.  I think it was a big mistake.  I understand, however, that it has changed tack and reversed its position.  Like any other country, Ukraine needs to be inclusive of all those who live within its borders and ways must be found to ensure people are included and feel included.  Where there is no inclusion and issues of national identity and language rights arise, there are mechanisms in place for dealing with them.  For example, the Council of Europe has very robust procedures for dealing with issues of language rights.  In some respects, the OSCE was established to address the kinds of issue that are arising in Ukraine and has long experience of dealing with them.  I would like to see an observer mission from it travel to Ukraine to look at these issues and what is happening in Crimea.  Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of who was verifying what was happening and who the referee was.  The advantage in having the OSCE is that Russia is a very important member.  I have some experience in this regard because I chaired the OSCE for one year and would like to think the way in which it could make its decision would not be subject to a veto as such.  It requires consensus, but that consensus is based on the commitments each participating state has made to comply with the principles of the OSCE.  This is certainly one occasion on which and space in which it has a role to play and it should be enabled to play it.<\/p><p> Ultimately, the political issues and those around national identity and the transition taking place that have been thrown up by the crisis in Ukraine are capable of being addressed and resolved without recourse to military action or the threat of it.  We must condemn Russia's use of the threat of military action and the use of its enormous military power to come the heavy on Ukraine.  I appreciate that some statements were made overnight about troops being recalled to barracks, which is to be welcomed.  The Russian ambassador reminded me today of the statement President Putin had made to the effect that while parliament had given authorisation for the use of military force on the territory of Ukraine, this had not been activated.  Again, I draw some comfort from this.  The threat of military action in Ukraine needs to be taken out of the equation.  That having been done, there is certainly enormous scope and space for Russia to work with the European Union to address the very real problems in Ukraine.  <\/p><p> At the special meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday there was a very clear message, as one would have seen in the conclusions, about our condemnation of what had happened in Ukraine and the actions taken by Russia.  However, there is also a very strong willingness on the part of the European Union to work with Russia on the difficulties in Ukraine.  To address the point made by Senator Jim Walsh in particular, Russia is a respected partner of the European Union.  It is one of its strategic partners.  There is a very strong economic relationship between the European Union and Russia.  As a country, we have a growing trade relationship with Russia.  We have a joint economic commission with Russia and would like to see ourselves being able to make progress along these dimensions.  This is not the 19th century.<\/p> <p>This is a world which is much more complex and where information is available with the click of a button.  The kind of behaviour we saw from Russia last week, and particularly over the weekend, has no place in modern diplomacy or relations between states.  We cannot have a world in which big powers, with all of their military might, can act the heavy or breathe down the neck of a neighbouring state to force it to do things it does not want to do.  As far as Ireland is concerned - I am confident that I am reflecting the views of the Irish people as a whole - we want international relations to be conducted in a respectful and peaceful manner that does not threaten the security and peace of the world.  I sincerely hope the situation in Ukraine will be de-escalated but what we have seen over the past several days was the most dangerous moment Europe has experienced since the end of the Cold War.  When a state engages in that kind of military build up, it takes very little to set off something that is difficult to get back into the bottle afterwards.  I hope the efforts that are set to continue until the European Council meeting on Thursday and, perhaps, beyond will help to de-escalate the situation so that a resolution can be found.<\/p><p> On Uganda, I have issued a statement expressing our strong views on the legislation that was passed there.  When I met President Museveni two years ago this was one of the issues I discussed directly with him.  This legislation is wrong and it will have consequences for our relations with Uganda.  For other reasons we have suspended our government-to-government aid programme with Uganda but the issue will be discussed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, and his colleagues at the Development Council.<\/p><p> The current round of Middle East talks is due to be completed by 30 April.  If the partners agree a framework it is possible that negotiations could continue beyond that date but the important issue is that we continue to support the ongoing efforts in this regard.  Deputy Crowe and Senator Walsh raised the related issue of settlement products.  Officials working for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy are putting together a framework for a European Union approach to settlement products.  To some extent this process is currently on pause because of the ongoing talks.  As a country, we have reserved our position on proceeding with a national approach to the matter but I would first like to see whether the talks progress.  On the specific issue of Irish businesses, I am not aware of any Irish business operating in the Occupied Territories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400008#K00600","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1393954800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>They are buying goods from companies based in the settlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014030400010#M00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1393954800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>It is a matter we can certainly examine.
