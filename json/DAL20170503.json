Mr. Gridzuiska did not brake, stop his vehicle or check on Shane O'Farrell's condition.  He fled the scene, abandoned his car and hid it very well 5 km up the road.  One issue is that he should not have been at liberty at the time if the criminal justice system had been working properly.  He had been in breach of bail conditions 18 times at least and had suspended sentences.  He had actually been sentenced to a custodial sentence which he did not serve.  He was well known to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Interpol and the PSNI.  He had an extensive criminal background, with at least 40 previous convictions for a variety of offences, including theft, aggravated burglary, handling stolen property, malicious damage, drug-related offences, including the possession of heroin, and road traffic offences.  In June 2010, a year before Shane's death, he was sentenced to six months in prison, but he never served one day of it.  We do not know why.  All through this, the O'Farrell family, particularly Shane's parents, Lucia and Jim, and his sisters, have been stoic, courageous and brave in pursuing justice for their son and brother who was a talented young lawyer and student who had everything to give in his life.<\/p>  <p>  The entire case reveals shocking malpractice and dysfunction in the criminal justice system at all levels.  The O'Farrell family have complained to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, the Director of Public Prosecutions and regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Department of Justice and Equality.  They are awaiting a GSOC report.  It is clear that they were misled by the Garda about the facts of their son's death.  The courts were misled by the Garda and others.  They were not informed of relevant information when judges asked questions about the accused.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, offences involving a violent death should not go unpunished.  I know that other Members have met Lucia O'Farrell and her family.  We owe it collectively to them to ensure justice is done.<\/p><p>The most effective way at this stage, in our view, is for an inquiry to be established into all the aspects of this case so we can learn lessons and justice can be delivered for the Farrell family.  It would enable the dysfunction within our criminal justice system highlighted by this case to be put to right.  Has the Government given consideration to this?

The Deputy correctly raises questions about the failures that occurred in many parts of our justice system in this case but I cannot pass judgment on any of those.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality met the family and I am sure she is considering the issues raised.  I am sure many of the relevant matters are being examined by the Garda Services Ombudsman Commission but it goes deeper than that.  As the Deputy knows, the D&aacute;il recently established a commission to look at deeper issues within the Garda surrounding the culture, management and recruitment.  We have had very worthwhile debates in the House about the need for such a commission to give public confidence and reassurance to those garda&iacute; who every day go out and put their lives on the line in pursuit of those doing wrong in our society.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, it has not come to Cabinet to the best of my knowledge to consider the specific circumstances of this case.  As I understand it, under legislation it would in the first instance be for the Minister for Justice and Equality to propose issues relating to the suggestion made by the Deputy of a public inquiry.  I cannot shed light on whether there is a case for such a public inquiry as I do not have access to sufficient facts and detail on that.  It is perhaps an issue that can be raised directly with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I will certainly convey the concern of the Deputy to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  In the past number of years in the D&aacute;il we sought to establish much stronger institutions of accountability and oversight within the D&aacute;il.  We have established the Garda authority and strengthened the Garda Services Ombudsman Commission.  We have also established the Garda Inspectorate.  No system will be perfect but I hope these new institutions will lead to a position where incidents like this cannot be repeated.

On that night of 2 August 2011, an hour before Shane O'Farrell was killed, Mr. Gridzuiska - the man who was driving in the hit-and-run car - was a passenger in a vehicle stopped by the Garda national drugs unit.  At the scene the garda&iacute; believed the driver and two passengers were in possession of a controlled substance.  In any event the vehicle was being driven by an uninsured driver and the vehicle did not have a valid national car test certificate.  The garda&iacute; failed to seize the car and instead selected Mr. Gridzuiska to switch from being a passenger to being the driver.  The garda&iacute; failed to consider whether Mr. Gridzuiska had valid insurance for the vehicle.  It is an extraordinary case.  We can learn lessons from the extraordinary level of dysfunction in this case.

The meeting was a farce.  We were not furnished with an advance copy of the 60-page document, or any copy for that matter, which meant that a discussion on the Government's published approach was not possible.  The meeting was effectively abandoned.  This reflects the Government's persistent refusal to consult properly with the leaders of the Opposition on important issues such as this.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently advocated that the Government take a stronger position on Brexit.  We made detailed submissions to the Taoiseach both before and after the draft EU negotiating guidelines were published.  Following our recent criticism, in response to Deputy Pearse Doherty the Taoiseach advised us that the Government had submitted further wording in advance of last Saturday's meeting of the 27 EU member states.  However, the D&aacute;il has not been told what these amendments were.  I can find only one minor amendment in the agreed text.  That is what the Government got into the text.  What it did not get into it was a commitment that there would be no agreement on the Border or on the status of the North without a separate and binding agreement between the Irish Government and Britain.  That would have been similar to the position secured by Spain in respect of Gibraltar.  I suspect we did not get that because we did not ask for it.  Irish unity was not mentioned in the initial draft guidelines.  Again, I suspect that the Government did not ask for it.  It is not in last Saturday's guidelines either.  Did the Government even try to have it included?  The Taoiseach refuses to tell us, so perhaps the Minister, Deputy Bruton, could let us know.  Instead, the Government settled for it being in the minutes of the meeting.<\/p>  <p>  While that is a welcome development, it is no accident that it is not reflected in the directives published by Michel Barnier today.  His negotiating directives for the European Commission are in line with the European Council guidelines.  That means they are generally vague and aspirational.  That is neither Michel Barnier's nor the European Commission's fault, but the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  Mr. Barnier is well disposed towards Ireland but he can only do what he is asked to do.  The record is pitiful and lamentable.  The record of this and the last Government in dealing with our European partners is not a good one.  The European Council guidelines could have gone considerably further.  We all know there is a recognition in the European Union of the special unique circumstances faced by Ireland as a result of Brexit, but a stronger approach by the Government could have achieved a great deal more.  This means there is a huge amount to do in the forthcoming negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know if the Taoiseach will be around to follow through on that or whether he will hand the task to somebody else when he finishes his long goodbye.  Will the Minister implore the Taoiseach to seek support for designated status for the North within the European Union, in other words, to keep the entire island within the EU, and insist on a veto for Ireland on any deal that does not include that provision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300005#C00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1493817000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous work done by the Taoiseach and many others across the Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Ministers, and by many throughout the public service.<\/p><p> A fair and balanced judgment of the negotiating mandate would recognise that we could not be in a stronger position than we are in terms of the letter from Downing Street and the recognition it gave to the concerns about Irish issues, the protection of the peace process, the common travel area, opportunities for trade and so on.  That is further enshrined in Article 11 of the negotiating mandate agreed to at the weekend. <\/p> <p> The European Union has set out very clearly the issues of unique concern to Ireland and openly recognised the Good Friday Agreement and the need to recognise what it means for Northern Ireland into the future.  It has recognised the need to avoid a hard border and its importance, not just economically but also politically and for the common travel area.  It recognises that those prior agreements such as the common travel area that were part and parcel of our arrangements before the European Union was established are recognised as legal instruments and have to be taken into account in the negotiations.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach and his team have put us in a very strong position.  Not only that, significant work has been done in examining every sector of the economy and building on the basis of what we have achieved to date in order to make the economy resilient in order that we can meet these challenges.  Today the CSO has recognised that the level of unemployment is now 6.2%.  Over 200,000 extra people are back at work.  This has been achieved through a consistent approach by the Government to diversifying our exports, strengthening innovation in the economy and enhancing the enterprise base of the economy.  These measures are vital. <\/p> <p> I rarely hear speakers from Sinn F&eacute;in say how important it is that we sustain the economic resilience that was built so painstakingly because that essentially is the way in which we will be able to respond creatively to the challenges.  It is very encouraging to note that the European Union has stated that, in view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required, including the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the legal order in the Union.  The European Union went on to state that, in this context, it should also recognise existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland which are compatible with EU law.  The European Union could not have gone further at this point.  We all know that we are embarking on a challenging period of negotiations and that we have to have the resilience and flexibility to respond as the situation develops.  I can assure Deputy Gerry Adams that the Government has put a lot of preparation into ensuring we will be in such a position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300005#C00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493817600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Minister has said flexible and imaginative solutions are required.  What does that mean?  Is it a case of \"Whatever you are having yourself\"?  Everyone in the Government is a negotiator.  He or she needs to have substantive, definitive, clear and unqualified commitments, rather than wishy-washy rhetoric.  It is clear that Brexit will have a serious and detrimental effect on Irish jobs and businesses, in particular in the agriculture and agrifood sectors.  I did not argue that the document produced by the Government was not the result of hard work, especially on the part of public officials.  I do not doubt them and commend them for their work.  The problem is that that work has not been directed by any big political vision or strategy.  It is little wonder that Michel Barnier's directives are vague.  That is the failing of the Government and the Taoiseach.  It is not a criticism of anyone except the Government.  These challenging times demand political direction which is visionary and imaginative, but it is not being provided.  If we do not provide it, no one else in the European Union will do it for us.  We need clear and definitive proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I again make the case that the best way to secure our future is through achieving designated special status for the North within the European Union.  Incidentally, that would recognise the decision of the people of the North who voted to remain, but the Government continues to resist it.  Why will it not call for special designated status for the North within the European Union?

Almost a month has passed since the House debated the urgently needed reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister will recall that the debate was a bit of a farce in that the amendment tabled by my party was carried while every other amendment and then the substantive motion itself were all defeated.  As such, the D&aacute;il ended that protracted discussion with no clearly determined decision on this urgent matter.  Nevertheless, there was a sense of unity in the Chamber on a couple of points during the debate.  First, there was agreement on the need to provide the Policing Authority with greater powers to require the Garda Commissioner to implement the radical reform agenda set out in the inspectorate's report.  Second, there was broad agreement on the need to establish a root and branch, or Patten style, review.  Unfortunately and as is so often the case in relation to justice matters, which Deputy Martin highlighted, once the spotlight disappears so does the sense of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  Almost a month has passed and we have yet to see concrete results.  Indeed, six weeks have passed since we learned of the huge exaggeration of the breath tests.  Almost three months have passed since we agreed on the need for the establishment of the Charleton commission and the first report of such a root and branch review emerged and was agreed.  I must ask for an update on the progress being made because none has been presented to the D&aacute;il to date.  There are no Garda updates on the implementation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's reforms.  Garda&iacute; cite work pressures which prevent them from getting around to doing this.  Last week, the Policing Authority made clear its frustration at the slow rate of progress on some of the significant reforms required.  The Garda Commission must act now, as must Government.  A valid concern has been raised about the proposed root and branch review which is that it will delay much-needed reform.  Such concerns are given legs when more and more delay is evident and the review is put off.  My question is straightforward and has been asked before.

Ten days ago, the assembly finished its deliberations and recommended that the current eighth amendment had to go, that the D&aacute;il had to legislate for abortion rights and that ultimately women themselves should be the people who make the decision that they need an abortion.  I was wondering whether the Taoiseach, given the Citizens' Assembly was his brainchild, feels like the parent whose child has rebelled against him.  It is very clear the Taoiseach thought the Citizens' Assembly was a pliable ploy that would come back with very minimal change.

After all, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, the current Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, thought it would be fine and dandy that a National Maternity Hospital could be given over to a religious order with a history of abuse and that nobody would think that a problem.  They were way behind public opinion, because the general public thought otherwise.<\/p> <p> The Tuam scandal has graphically illustrated for the public that the Catholic Church was not pro-life when it came to poor, pregnant women and their babies, but unfortunately the change in social attitudes is not reflected in this D&aacute;il.  It would appear that, right now, only Solidarity, People Before Profit and a handful of Independents have the same position on abortion as the Citizens' Assembly has recommended.  Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a concerted campaign of engagement and political pressure now to bring most of the parties in the D&aacute;il up to the level of public opinion on abortion rights?  The thousands who have been demanding repeal have to actively contact and seek meetings with Deputies, telling them that they want change and a referendum.  Would the Minister agree that the fifth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar would be a very timely occasion for this issue to be resolved?  Having the Citizens' Assembly as the chosen method of dealing with the eighth amendment, are he and his party going to accept its findings or are they going to try to water them down as has been advocated by some?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300008#F01400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493819100,"counter":36,"content":"<p>First of all, I will pass on the Deputy's disappointment that the Taoiseach was not here to answer her question.

I have been around for long enough to recognise how difficult it has been for many people.  The motivation of the Taoiseach in establishing the Citizens' Assembly mirrors what he did in the case of the X case.  As the Deputy knows, the X case lay around for 20 years, and no D&aacute;il had the courage of its convictions to deal with what the Supreme Court had found in the X case.  The Taoiseach established a process that allowed the D&aacute;il to make those decisions.  Those were done under his stewardship.  The approach he took was to have a Citizens' Assembly, to follow that up with an Oireachtas committee and then to move on to legislate.  He is mirroring that approach in what he is doing now.  I commend the Citizens' Assembly and Ms Justice Mary Laffoy for the painstaking work that they have taken upon themselves.  I am looking forward to that report which will be with us before the end of June.  The Oireachtas is going to establish an all-party D&aacute;il and Seanad committee to examine the recommendations coming from the Citizens' Assembly, and that will come back to the House.  That will be done within three months of its sitting.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's intention is clearly that this will not lie untouched.  This is an issue of considerable importance to the people.  We have established an approach that has proved itself in the past.  It will give the opportunity to this House to consider these issues in a fair and balanced way without seeking to push or bully people but allowing a sensible debate based on the facts and on the work done by the assembly and by others.  That is an approach that commends itself.  It is the Legislature doing its work, and it is innovative in bringing in the Citizens' Assembly, which as the Deputy recognises herself, has been a very useful exercise in broadening the base of the discussion that we can have.  It will be coming back to the Oireachtas and the opportunity will be here to thrash out the issues, through the committee initially and then here on the floor of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300009#G00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1493819100,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister will answer this on his second chance.

The net effect of the sales of those products produced abroad under the contract of those relocated headquarters added to Ireland&rsquo;s balance sheet of trade in goods and services in the national accounts.  This doubled from &euro;35 billion to &euro;70 billion.  Although there was a significant jump in 2015, the relocation and repatriation of intellectual property was not new.

As the Deputy is aware and will appreciate, voluntary and non-statutory providers, including religious bodies, have historically played an important role in the provision of health and social services in Ireland.  It is fair to say the current arrangements have grown out of a complicated past.  Policy must reflect current realities as well as available options over the medium term.  The recent debate surrounding the location of the National Maternity Hospital has generated increased discussion of issues of ownership and governance in our health services, and in particular our hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I am anxious not to delay the long overdue National Maternity Hospital project while this wider conversation is taking place, and that is why I have set out a process I would like to follow that is separate and distinct for the National Maternity Hospital in order to tease out the important issues that the public has expressed concern about in recent days and weeks.  It is important to note that over the years not only has the role of religious personnel in the day-to-day operation of hospitals reduced but in some cases there has been a transfer of ownership to the State.  Examples include the transfer Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to the then North Eastern Health Board.  Other voluntary or charitable hospitals have closed, such as Hume Street Hospital, or have been subject to mergers into newly created public bodies, such as Jervis Street and the Richmond into Beaumont Hospital.  Therefore, evolution is not new and change has also taken place across the wider health service in areas such as nursing homes and disability centres.<\/p>  <p>  A number of our largest and most developed acute hospitals are voluntary hospitals.  In contrast with health board or Health Service Executive, HSE, hospitals they have evolved governance structures with significant non-executive involvement.  It is important in looking to the future that such strengths are recognised.  It is also the case that in recent years, the nature of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State has been clarified in a number of ways.  The HSE operates a governance framework that governs grant funding provided to all non-statutory service providers and provides for detailed service level agreements.  In the voluntary sector, it is required practice for public capital investment to be accompanied by a lien that protects the State's interest.  All public hospitals are regulated by HIQA and are subject to national clinical standards and guidelines.  Moreover, as part of the establishment of hospital groups, voluntary hospitals have been required to plan and deliver services in a manner that integrates service provision with HSE-owned hospitals in the region.<\/p>  <p>  It is long overdue for us to try to structure this conversation about the direction people would like to see.  We have seen similar conversations taking place with education.  I am interested in the Deputy's view and I suggest to the House that we could benefit from such a conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300018#Q01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1493823900,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  There is a Private Members' motion to be discussed tonight in that context and we can elaborate on it then.  Much focus over the past fortnight has been on the ownership of St. Vincent's Hospital but we are ignoring the fact that the National Maternity Hospital is a voluntary hospital in itself.  The Coombe, which is intending to transfer to St. James's Hospital, is also a voluntary hospital, as is the Rotunda, which is going to Connolly Hospital.  The three maternity hospitals in Dublin are voluntary hospitals as well.  This leads to the greater question in the context of the establishment of hospital groups and the statutory provision of underpinning them with boards.  Where will the voluntary governance structure fit into the new hospital groupings if we are to continue with the proposals that the Government has announced on having a hospital group with a governing board overseeing it?  Reference has been made to the National Maternity Hospital and the controversy that has flowed from that.  It concentrates the mind to a certain extent that we can no longer ignore the fact that voluntary hospitals in the main are largely funded by the State and contracted to provide services to the State.

There would be a degree of public consultation and the input of clinicians.  The Deputy's point is important as many of our hospitals are voluntary and many clinicians highlight the benefits of the voluntary system, preferring that system to working in a hospital that is fully owned and funded by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that of the 49 hospitals we have in this country, 15 are voluntary, with two having joint boards and 32 being statutory.

Perhaps that is the direction we need to take, but we must have that conversation.  The Deputy is entirely correct that it must be in discussion with the voluntary hospitals.  Some political parties in the House have suggested that I should, as it were, sneak in and seize hospitals from voluntary groups in the middle of the night.  There are laws and a Constitution in this country so we must have a conversation, just as we have done in education.

This approach appears to have happened in a small number of cases but it was raised with the HSE in the context of a legal challenge by a group of 42 private providers in respect of the planned 2014 tender for enhanced home care.  The not-for-profit providers referred to in the legal challenge were almost wholly funded by the HSE at that time, and continue to be significantly funded by HSE to provide home help services.  In circumstances where a client funded element of service was developing, concern was expressed that such arrangements may constitute cross subsidisation or could amount to state aid.   <\/p>  <p>  Agreement was subsequently reached between the HSE and representatives of the private providers.  Under that agreement and to avoid any doubt, the HSE made it clear that the type of arrangement I described earlier was not acceptable to the executive and was to cease.  If a not-for-profit provider wishes to develop the private element of its business, in the same way as a commercial entity, it may withdraw from HSE funded home help arrangements.  This is not an issue of the State not wishing to provide support or help, but a legal issue to which we must adhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300019#R00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1493824500,"counter":163,"content":"<p>It is not a legal issue at all, but I wish to see the detail of the agreement reached between the HSE and the for-profit providers.

Additional funding in budget 2017 has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;853 million for all HSE mental health services.  The HSE service plan for 2017 prioritises improvement of all aspects of CAMHS, including the development of early intervention counselling and prevention services in primary care to reduce pressures on CAMHS and improvements to specialist CAMHS community-based and acute inpatient care.<\/p>  <p>  CAMH services have benefitted from the significant additional investment in mental health in recent years, although these services face particular challenges in recruiting and retaining staff.  The HSE is addressing this on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The HSE is also giving priority to reducing CAMHS waiting lists, especially for those waiting over 12 months.  This is dependent on the availability of key clinicians within teams, in particular CAMHS consultant psychiatrists.  We know that within mental health services, in particular CAMHS services, there is a high turnover of staff.  This is something with which we are trying to deal.  It can be a very challenging but rewarding environment.<br\/><br\/>Additional resources have assisted in supporting 67 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to increase the number of people working in these teams.  There are also 66 CAMHS inpatient beds in operation nationally.  A new standard operating procedure, introduced in June 2015, has also provided greater clarity and consistency on how the service is delivered.  Despite increasing demands overall on CAMHS, irrespective of the source of referrals, individual cases professionally assessed as requiring urgent access to services receive priority.  Further acute inpatient beds will also come onstream as staffing levels increase.<br\/><br\/>The HSE service plan for this year provides for better out-of-hours liaison and seven-day response cover in CAMHS, against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by 8,500 in 2016-17.  Around 18,500 children will attend the HSE CAMHS service this year, including around 14,000 referrals.

These posts have been sanctioned for recruitment.  Despite the challenges outlined, I am satisfied that significant efforts are under way to develop all aspects of CAMHS.

The figures show that CAMHS is clearly struggling, with only half of the required staff in place to provide a full service.  Successive Ministers have promised to prioritise mental health services, but the reality is that the area continues to be a blind spot for the Department of Health.

We know that when we can provide a level of support within the community at a much earlier stage, young children are less likely to be referred.

The <\/font>terms of the agreement which have been published in full provide for the establishment of a new company, The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC, limited by shares.  The new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and copperfastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  The reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the directors and the approval of the Minister for Health.  This is a greater level of input than the Minister for Health has today in some maternity hospitals.  <\/font>The agreement ensures a full range of health services will be available at the new National Maternity Hospital without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the further confirmation by the board of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out at the new hospital.  <\/p><p>Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted, we must turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to complete the project.  The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">St.Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital <\/font>and operated by the new company.  In the next few weeks I intend to meet representatives of both hospitals and will further consider the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the ownership of the new facility.  I have indicated that, prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure the facilities will be legally secured on an ongoing basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.  Over the years we have made a significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals and such facilities have always continued to be used for the delivery of publicly funded health care as intended, including Holles Street hospital.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>I intend to report to the Government on the project at the end of May.

The facilities at Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.

Letterkenny University Hospital provides essential and high-quality hospital care to patients in the north-west.  I assure the Deputy of the continued commitment to develop services at the hospital as evidenced by the significant number of completed and ongoing capital projects there.  In addition, Letterkenny has been leading the way nationally in developing cross-Border services for cardiac and cancer patients.  I was delighted to visit Altnagelvin recently with the Northern Ireland health Minister to see first hand that cross-Border work.  The breast cancer service at Letterkenny operates as a satellite centre of University Hospital Galway and is run by a consultant who also undertakes general surgery.  It is augmented by visiting Galway-based and locum consultants.  Efforts are being made to recruit a full-time locum consultant surgeon to address current service demands.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may know, I met recently with cancer support groups from the area and I thank them for their engagement.  The national cancer control programme, my Department and the Saolta group are actively engaged in ensuring that quality breast cancer services are available.  Consideration continues to be given to longer-term measures to meet future service requirements, including consultant and other staffing issues.  The diabetes service at the hospital is led by a consultant endocrinologist supported by a locum consultant general physician who has a diabetic interest.  Additional clinics are being provided in order to address diabetes waiting lists.  The Saolta group advises that an application for a second consultant endocrinologist is currently being completed by the HSE medical directorate with hospital management.  It will then be submitted to the consultant appointments advisory committee for approval.  New consultant surgeons specialising in colorectal and general surgery and a consultant anaesthetist have been recently recruited and a number of consultant posts are currently undergoing recruitment processes.  The hospital continues to innovate in its recruitment practices.  I thank the hospital and acknowledge its work in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In my recent engagement in March with cancer support and lobby groups in Donegal, I agreed along with the national cancer control programme that there was a case for exploring possible options for co-operation with Altnagelvin on breast cancer services.  It was agreed to hold a meeting in the coming weeks in Letterkenny involving Saolta, the national cancer control programme, Oireachtas Members from Donegal, Donegal Action for Cancer Care and Co-operating for Cancer Care NorthWest.

In January 2016, it was announced that a second breast cancer surgeon had been approved for Letterkenny University Hospital and that recruitment would start immediately, but it is now May 2017 with no sign of him or her coming.  At one stage last year, there was only one general surgeon in Letterkenny Hospital.  That was the cancer surgeon who also does general surgery, as the Minister said.  When a surgeon was recruited, two days of surgery were provided in the period of three months in the hospital.  This is the kind of thing that is going on.  While it is good that meetings are happening, we are not seeing any progress outside of the meetings.  Nothing is happening.<\/p>  <p>  The Saolta group has been preparing the business case for the recruitment of an endocrinologist for over two years at this stage.  We are still no further on.  It is impossible to escape the point that while words are being said, nothing is happening.

I will take up with the Saolta group the point the Deputy makes about the length of time it seems to be taking for the group to apply to the consultant appointments advisory committee in relation to a consultant endocrinologist and revert to him directly on that.  For clarity, I note that it is a full-time locum consultant service to address current service demands for the breast cancer service at Letterkenny.  That is also under way.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the way forward in the longer term and without wishing to speak for the groups, there was general agreement among those I met to look at cross-Border opportunities and the possibility of a joint posting between Altnagelvin and Letterkenny.

However, the elephant in the room is Brexit and how this will impact on marrying together the clinical services and providing a service, if this is how it will be done.  We need to see action.  It will be a shock to people in Donegal to realise a full-time locum breast surgeon is all that is being sought at present when in January 2016 the announcement was that a full-time breast surgeon would be appointed in Letterkenny.  We have enough locums.  We do not need locums; we need actual appointments and action.  A concern we had when the hospital groups were established was whether we would see a pull of services into Galway, and this certainly seems to be what is happening.  I ask the Minister to take up this point with the Saolta group.  The journey time from Donegal to Galway is four to five hours.

This is a point I took up with the Saolta hospital group and the national cancer control programme when it was brought to my attention by cancer support groups and Oireachtas Members in Donegal.  It is absolutely essential that Saolta continues to manage the satellite service at Letterkenny University Hospital and ensures consultants from Galway travel to Letterkenny.  For one consultant to travel to Letterkenny to see patients rather than a number of patients having to travel to Galway was the concept behind having the satellite unit.  There are certain issues for which the patient would remain in Letterkenny and the doctor would go to see them but for other issues the patient would obviously need to go to Galway.  This debate has been long had.  We need to see a greater direction of travel in terms of consultants travelling to Letterkenny.  There has been some concern expressed by groups on it.

The reason the HSE has ceased reporting the number of private beds in public hospitals is that since 2014, as referenced by the Deputy, all private patients are charged in a similar manner, and the charges set for private patients are no longer set with reference to being in private or semi-private hospital beds.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013, as Deputy Chambers mentioned, established the basis for this policy, enabling all private patients in a public hospital to be subject to charges.  The Act addressed a situation previously identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General whereby when private inpatients were accommodated in public or non-designated beds no private inpatient charges applied, despite the patients having a private treatment relationship with their consultants.  This was a matter highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General to which the legislation endeavoured to respond.  The absence of a maintenance charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and to taxpayers at large.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014 revised charges are levied on all private patients.  The charging regime now distinguishes between the accommodation of private patients in single rooms and multi-occupancy rooms, with the former charged at a higher rate.  Analysis I commissioned at the request of Deputy Kelleher is being finalised by my Department.  It indicates that changes to the charging structure have not resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of patients treated on a private basis in public acute hospitals.  I hope to be in a position to share this with both Deputies in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  The use of beds in public hospitals is now more closely aligned with the clinical needs of the patients.  This change allows for more efficient use of beds, with priority being given to issues such as end of life care, where a person can be given a single room, and infection control, regardless of the public or private status of the patient.  The concern the Deputy has about these changes and the impact they have had on an extra number of private patients in public hospitals and the impact on the public health service is something on which I expect to have analysis in the coming days.  The initial analysis I have received suggests this has not seen such an increase and, therefore, this is the rationale behind not counting private beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300022#U00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1493826300,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Public hospitals should be for public patients and only public work should go on in public hospitals.  They should not be quasi-private institutions.  Patients receive private care in the public health system and this is not a progressive way to run a public health system.  What we have seen with the policy is that hundreds of thousands of people, who have already paid their taxes and who happen to hold health insurance, are being effectively charged twice.  This is what the policy stance has changed.  Instead of utilising the full capacity of public and private the Government has decided to charge people twice.  The fact the Minister does not know and cannot state in the D&aacute;il the number of beds used on a private basis is a serious concern with regard to management control.  We know from the health insurers' figures that hundreds of millions of euro of insurance is going to public hospitals to bail them out because of the inefficiency in the current system.  It is important the Minister addresses it.  There is a recommendation from the health policy reform committee to remove private work from public hospitals.

I stress again that I remain committed to developing all aspects of the mental health service, including CAMHS, which is a particular priority not just for me but also the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding in the budget for this year has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;853 million for HSE mental health services.  It takes into account significant additional resources for mental health services generally since 2012.  However, funding is not the core issue in CAMHS, to which the Deputy has referred in his question.  CAMHS services face particular challenges in the recruitment and retention of staff.  The turnover rate for CAMHS teams is particularly high.  That is an issue we are trying to address.  The HSE is addressing it on an ongoing basis.  We have recruited 1,150 staff in the past four years, of whom 270 have been for CAMHS teams.  The HSE has also given priority to reducing the CAMHS waiting list, especially for those waiting over 12 months.  This is dependent on the availability of key clinicians within teams, particularly CAMHS consultant psychiatrists.  I know that the issue the Deputy is raising is the fact that there is no child consultant psychologist on-call within emergency departments 24\/7.  That is an issue of which we are very aware.  Additional resources have assisted in supporting 67 CAMHS teams, with three paediatric liaison teams.  There are also 66 CAMHS inpatient beds in operation nationally, with additional beds to come on stream as staffing levels permit.  The new standard operating procedure introduced in 2015 has provided greater clarity and consistency on how the service is provided.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, during normal working hours, nine-to-five cover is provided Monday to Friday within mental health services by a number of interlinked components, including community mental health teams and emergency departments.  During the on-call period, between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m., Monday to Friday, and throughout the weekend period there is a consultant psychiatrist, together with a psychiatric registrar or senior house officer, on duty in acute hospitals.  Since 2014, this has been supplemented by the development of the self-harm clinical programme under which specialist nurses are available.  A preliminary review of weekend access by the HSE mental health division shows that weekend mental health services are provided in only eight of the 17 mental health areas.  In a further eight areas there is partial cover, in which in certain geographical areas within the service a weekend service is provided.  The HSE has prioritised the need to ensure access to a weekend service for current service users is provided in all areas.  A service improvement project was commenced last November to carry out more detailed mapping of current provision at weekends and the uptake in the extended hours services, taking account of international best practice and the service user perspective.  The position in Wexford will be addressed as part of the overall service improvement initiative.  <\/p>  <p>  I will answer the other questions asked when I speak again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300023#V00500","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1493826900,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The truth of the matter is that the service is not good enough in Wexford.  I recently asked the HSE what services were available for children and adolescents who presented with suicidal ideation but who were not deemed by CAMHS to have a psychiatric disorder.  The reply from the head of mental health services, Ms Liz Kinsella, stated individuals could access a health service on a 24-hour basis, despite the fact that I was asking about mental health services.  She went on to refer to a few of the services which were not available on a 24-hour but a nine-to-five, five days a week basis.  She referred to a school counsellor who was available during school hours and the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service which was available in Wexford town.  Again, it is a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday, service.  We rang two of the organisations she mentioned - I think the Minister of State mentioned one also - the HSE community primary care and disability psychology service and the HSE self-harm intervention programme, on the day we received her reply after 5 p.m. but it rang out.  She also referred to the CAMHS team in Wexford, but the question was what would happen when the CAMHS team put someone on a waiting list for psychology services?  The HSE needs to provide talking therapies for children that are affordable, easily accessed and promoted as part of the HSE child and mental health services.  The services available in Wexford are not what the Minister of State seems to think they are.  They are abysmal.

There is the Ferns Diocesen Youth Service that provides services in Enniscorthy, Gorey, New Ross and Wexford town.  It is for young people aged 13 to 25 years.  There are four day hospitals, Tara House, Carn House, Summerhill and Maryville; as well as the nurse specialist liaison service that is available seven days a week and the suicide crisis assessment nurse, SCAN.  I agree that there is a gap in the services, which is why, similar to the exercise happening in identifying where the gaps are in the sevens day a week service, progress has been ongoing with the HSE, service providers and the mental health teams to identify where consultant psychologist posts are not being filled within emergency departments on a 24-7 basis.  They are working with the HSE to identify how they can implement the initiative in the best way possible, obviously including in Wexford.

When the emergency care system is under pressure, there is the potential for delay in the transfer of care of patients from ambulance to emergency department personnel.  I accept that in a number of hospitals, including those highlighted in the individual questions, the emergency departments are particularly busy and this can contribute significantly to delays in ambulance turnaround.<\/p>  <p>  A framework has been developed to create a standardised approach between the national ambulance service and acute hospital emergency departments which allows all parties to understand their role in the timely release of ambulance resources from acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the framework sets out the escalation process to alert management, both within the national ambulance service and acute hospitals, to significant increases in emergency demand and activity, and occurrences of delayed turnarounds.  Hospital management is tasked to enable the release of all ambulance resources in a safe manner.<\/p>  <p>   In regard to emergency department overcrowding, my Department and the HSE are developing a plan focused on working with hospitals to improve performance, and overall patient experience which should also assist in improving ambulance turnaround times.  I have been assured that the HSE is committed to ensuring that patients are clinically handed over in a safe, professional and timely manner; with the safety and dignity of the patient being of paramount importance.<\/p>  <p>  If we are serious about reducing the turnaround times it means that we need to reduce the length of time people are spending in our emergency departments.

We still have a long way to go in this regard, and I look forward to talking to the INMO about recruitment of more nurses.  We have ambitious plans in place to hire 1,208 new nurses this year and have a number of incentives to try and assist in that regard, because it is very much interlinked with the ability of an ambulance to get in, safely hand over the patient, and get back to doing exactly what we want them to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300024#W00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1493827500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Minister recently met a delegation from Connemara to discuss the ambulance service.

Back in 2014, one of the ambulance bases there was determined by HIQA to be an ambulance black spot.  Since then we have had a crew appointed to that base in Mulranny, but unfortunately what we have seen happening is that that crew very often does not make it to the Mulranny base.  It is pulled back into Castlebar, Ballina or Belmullet, and so the area is not getting the service that we think we are getting.  This was back in 2014, three years ago.  The situation has not improved.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has touched on the HIQA response times.  We should have a first responder on the scene in just under eight minutes, and for a vehicle carrying a patient they should be there within 20 minutes, or just under 20 minutes.

It is not physically possible, with Belmullet, Castlebar and Ballina, and including Mulranny, to reach parts of our county in those times even if one leaves within minutes.  <\/p>  <p>  On the turnaround time at the hospital, from speaking to staff locally at Mayo University Hospital the feedback I am getting is that when an ambulance arrives at the hospital they very often have nowhere to put the patient.  There is no trolley or bed to transfer the patient to, so they cannot actually get the patient off the bed that has to go back into the ambulance, which remarkable.  These are ambulances that could be deployed to another area.  <\/p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of the massaging of figures relating to response times for many years.  If something happens in Galway a Castlebar ambulance will often be called when a Galway ambulance is not available in the knowledge that that ambulance will never make it to Galway.  It was, however, dispatched on time.  The ambulance may get half way there and then sent back when the Galway ambulance becomes available, thereby massaging the figures that the Minister is supposed to use to develop policy.

That is 26,629 calls over the full month of March.  Of all of those calls we saw 1,668 ambulances delayed for greater than an hour.

The Minister will be well aware of the difficulties in attracting nurses back and we all know people working in other jurisdictions where they are treated far better and have a smaller workload.  We need to do an awful lot more in terms of working conditions to attract highly skilled and qualified people back.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the reduction in trolley numbers at Mayo University Hospital this year as compared with last year.  I have raised the movement of patients to other wards with the Minister in the past but I do not know if he has looked into it.  They are often moved to the medical assessment and day service units in the hospital to remove them from the view of those who conduct the trolley watch.  Staff tell me that there is pressure on hospital management to ensure patients are not counted on trolleys so that the numbers can be made public.  They are human beings and it puts pressure on them and this incentivises some managers to do things which massage the figures, creating an inaccurate reflection of what is happening on the ground.  The Minister needs to look behind the figures and talk to staff in the hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300025#X00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1493828100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I always enjoy talking to staff in the health service and I have visited 48 of our hospitals in the past year.  The Deputy makes an important point about trolley figures.  The INMO produces its own trolley watch and its members have clear guidelines, as does the HSE, as to what constitutes a trolley as opposed to an additional bed.  Its figures are published on a daily basis and the HSE publishes figures three times a day.  The general secretary of the INMO is co-chair of the emergency department task force, where there is an exchange of information on this, so I believe the 12% decrease in April, according to the INMO's figures, is widely accepted among staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is entirely correct to say we need to recruit more nurses and we need to do more to recruit nurses.  The HSE has been at career fairs in London and, as part of our discussions with the INMO and SIPTU to avert industrial action, we agreed a number of measures including the doubling of the bring-them-home allowance from &euro;1,500 to &euro;3,000, and extending it beyond the UK.  There is a number of pre-retirement allowances for people who want to work part-time rather than full-time, meaning we keep a part-time nurse in the system.

The national clinical programme for stroke has been in place since early 2010.  The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care.  Early supported discharge is a rehabilitation programme that aims to accelerate discharge home from hospital and provide rehabilitation and support in the home setting in order to maximise independence as quickly as possible after stroke.  Pilot early supported discharge programmes in three sites in Ireland have proved to be effective, with up to 35% of stroke patients being discharged successfully.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised my Department that its integrated care programme for patient flow has identified the need to strengthen the integrated patient-centred approach.  Improving discharge processes is not only necessary to deliver safe and truly person-centred care but also to optimise bed utilisation.<\/p>  <p>  Funding has been allocated by the clinical strategy and programmes division to the integrated care programme to support the national clinical programme for stroke to expand the early support discharge stroke programme in 2017.  This involves increasing staffing in three existing early supported discharge stroke teams and developing two new teams at a full-year cost of &euro;460,051.<\/p>  <p>  Early supported discharge complements the range of measures to improve stroke care including 24-7 access to thrombolysis and increasing the number of stroke units to 22.  These measures have reduced stroke mortality, reduced average length of stay in hospital and enabled more stroke patients to be discharged directly to home.  This is in their rehabilitative interest as patients, as well as being in the interest of the health service by ensuring better bed utilisation.  In advance of the Estimates for 2018, the HSE will prepare costings for the roll-out of this programme and the Department is currently engaged with the HSE on the business case, as part of the development of the HSE's national service plan in advance of budget 2018.  I will share more information on this with the Deputy as it becomes available.  It will be hard not to agree on something that is beneficial and we are expanding it this year with additional teams.  There is scope to do more and I hope we will have a full business case in advance of the 2018 Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300025#X00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1493828100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The Minister says it will be 2018.

The long-established cost effectiveness helps in the production of any business case.  It is estimated that we could save between &euro;2 million and &euro;7 million a year.

I have been highlighting it for a long time.  I ask the Minister to answer the specific question about Tralee in County Kerry.

The difficulty is that while this is an issue that has been raised for some time and has been spoken about at length in this Chamber over the last 12 or 14 months, we are not seeing any positive impact happening on the ground.  Apart from premiums being reduced, they are not even stabilising.  As we speak, they are still increasing.  The Minister of State is probably aware of that himself.  Most Deputies see this issue at their clinic on a daily or weekly basis.  I certainly see it.  I see it raised by two groups of people.  One group is the private individuals trying to insure their cars.  The second group is the business people in the haulage or fleet businesses who are having serious ongoing problems.<\/p>  <p>  As we speak, premiums are still increasing by 30% and 40%.  That was never acceptable and is certainly no longer acceptable now.  It has been happening since about 2014.  We must reach a stage at which measures are implemented and put in place to stop this happening.  Rather than going into the issues of what has caused this and why it is happening, I believe we now need to stay focused on delivering a result and a solution and ensuring that premiums no longer escalate or increase but stabilise and return to the acceptable level they should be at to allow people to operate.  What is the Minister of State, his Department and the Government doing to ensure that the 33 recommendations proposed by the Oireachtas committee are being implemented in a way to bring about and deliver results?  As I said, that is not happening as we speak.<\/p>  <p>  We may need to look at opening up the market for other European companies to come to Ireland and quote for insurance policies to help put manners on the current insurance companies that currently operate in the market.  They are all operating through a mechanism by which the difference in their quotes is no more than &euro;20, &euro;30 or &euro;40.  That is not acceptable.  I remember being cautioned when I attended the Committee for Public Accounts and raised a concern by saying that the companies are operating in a cartel-type manner.  However, people can be forgiven for thinking like that because the increases are completely unacceptable and unsustainable.  People's circumstances are not changing in any way, yet they are still seeing their premiums increase by maybe &euro;300 or &euro;400, which equates to 30% or 40%.<\/p><p>It cannot be sustained.  What will happen is those people will end up not driving at all or will perhaps be forced to do something terribly wrong by driving without insurance.  For elderly people it will lead to further isolation.  People are already very stretched and adding this unacceptable level of premium on to their policy is completely overstretching them to the point of breaking.  That is the issue that has to be addressed.<\/p> <p> A haulage business in Kildare, which employs 29 people, contacted me yesterday because the cost of its policy has increased by 40%.  The person who contacted me is considering whether he will renew it, scale down his business or close.  It would have a massive negative impact on the local and national economy.  We know what the issues and recommendations are.  The question now is what will be done to bring reductions in motor insurance across all spectrums so people see results, which is not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300027#Z01200","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493829900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The Minister for Finance has responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither the Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits member states from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, the Minister is not in a position to direct insurance companies on the pricing level they should apply to particular categories of individuals.  However, the Government accepts it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, the Minister established the cost of insurance working group in July 2016 and appointed me as chair.<\/p>  <p>  The need for action was recognised by Government and accordingly the working group comprises representation from across Government, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the Central Bank and the State Claims Agency.  The working group consulted widely and published its report on the cost of motor insurance in January 2017.  The report targets six main objectives including that of protecting the consumer.  This objective in particular relates to protecting the consumer in the insurance purchasing process.  Important issues in this regard include increasing levels of transparency in respect of premiums, improving access to insurance and enhancing the quality of engagement with consumers.  Across the six objectives, the report contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation.  The Department of Finance is taking the lead in co-ordinating the overall implementation of the plan and the first quarterly update on the implementation of the recommendations was published this afternoon on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  I have already provided a preliminary update to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Action is happening across a number of fronts as per the report&rsquo;s action plan.  There is no simple or single solution to the problem of increasing insurance prices which was recognised by the committee&rsquo;s report on the matter last year.  It is envisaged the implementation of all the recommendations with the appropriate levels of commitment and co-operation from all relevant stakeholders should achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  This in turn should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and help prevent the volatility we have seen in the market in the past.  It should also better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  The latest data from the Central Statistics Office indicate there has been no month-on-month increase in the cost of motor insurance during the first three months of this year.  The trend shows that since summer 2016, there has been a decrease in the consumer price index of the cost of motor insurance.  If this trend continues, I am hopeful it might signal the start of a stabilisation of pricing in the market as the actions continue to be implemented over the next 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as additional competition into the market is concerned, the Central Bank has announced recently that applications for new insurance entities into the Irish market have been made to the Central Bank and other applications are imminent.  In so far as employer liability insurance and public liability insurance are concerned the working group is now in its second phase of work and we are looking at those issues.  The working groups is engaging with industry stakeholders to see what additional measures might be introduced in addition to the measures that were announced in the action plan for motor insurance earlier this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300028#AA00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1493829900,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I took some notes while the Minister of State was speaking.  One of the last things he mentioned, which is very welcome if it is the case, was that applications have been made by four other companies to operate in the insurance market in this country.  If it is the case, it will hopefully help the issue we are speaking about and also help the people who need it badly.  It is the responsibility of Government to put measures in place to implement the findings of the commission and the joint Oireachtas committee.  That is why it was set up.  Perhaps we need to have shorter review times.  The review period is quarterly but if we are serious about delivering results on the ground for the people and businesses that need it perhaps we should have more frequent review periods to let everyone see we are really serious about delivering for the people where it matters.  People will be thinking we are just speaking about it again, which we have been doing for the past 12 or 14 months.  It is not an issue that has happened overnight; it is one that has been happening since 2014.  It is worth pointing out that between 2000 and 2013, when the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was in place there was not the escalation of motor insurance premiums of the scale we have had in the past three years.  Perhaps we should have a shorter term review to send a strong message that we are serious about having results on the ground and about having a stabilisation and reduction of insurance premiums.  That sends out a strong message.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept what the Minister of State said about there being no increases reported for the first three months of the year.

I am not so sure how realistic the information is.  On the ground the reality is that motor insurance premiums are increasing.  It is putting people under serious pressure.

Applications have been made by new entities to the Central Bank.  I do not have the latest numbers but they were in the region of between three and five the last time I got the figures from the Central Bank.  It is positive that new entities will be coming into the Irish market.  I have to see how that plays out into the future in so far as other entities are concerned.  The action plan's first quarterly report came out this afternoon.  When one looks at that action plan, one will be able to see in detail what actions have happened according to the timeline envisaged for this first quarter of our report and also what progress has been made on actions that are due for completion in other quarters this year and next year.  It is a very important level of transparency so that everyone here, all stakeholders, consumers and the Oireachtas, can see exactly how we are managing our targets.  It shows progress.  It is very important that I have already reported to the Oireachtas committee on a number of occasions and given preliminary reports ahead of that quarterly reporting.  This is not a report sitting on a shelf.  There are actions here with lead owners - people who are responsible for implementing these actions - and I, as chair, am responsible for reporting to make sure those actions take place.  The level of transparency shows the commitment from the Government.  The CSO figures show a positive trend.  The CSO is responsible for calculating them.  We should not causally question those figures unless we have a solid basis for doing so.  On an anecdotal level, we are both aware of people who are still seeing increases in their individual premiums.  The figures I gave were on motor insurance.  The second phase of the working group's work is under way and is dealing with employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  We are looking at additional measures we can implement to add to the measures we already have in motor insurance.  When one looks at the report, one will see the measures we are bringing in for the consumer with regard to transparency of data and things like fraud will have an impact beyond motor insurance and into other areas of insurance.  There is still work to do there and it is important we get that work right.  We do not want to take an action that might act as a disincentive for new entrants to come into the market.  We need to see a competitive space in the insurance sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300028#AA00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","time":1493829900,"counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300028#AA00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1493829900,"counter":293,"content":"<p>This issue arises from a reply received to a question about waiting lists in University Hospital Limerick and non-attendees.  Some of the figures I have been presented with are quite startling.  The answer I received outlined outpatient department attendance in 2015.  The number of new appointments was 34,900; of these, 5,633 did not attend.<\/p><p>Outpatient department review appointments totalled 115,649, with 18,701 non-attendances, representing 16% of the total.  In 2016 new appointments totalled 35,536, an increase of approximately 600.  There was also an increase in the number of no-shows which was up by between 400 and 500.  That figure was creeping up to 17%, at 6,029.  Review appointments in that year totalled 120,875, with 21,294 non-attendances, representing 17.6% of the total.  We need to quantify the exact percentage each year.  If one takes the cataract waiting list in University Hospital Limerick, for example, reducing the 16% no-show figure could increase the number of patients seen by between 130 and 140 per year.  <br\/><br\/>Even from a standing still position, this would be a way of combating long waiting lists and increasing efficiency.  The HSE has pointed out that the statistics to which I have just referred represent the total numbers of new and review outpatient clinic attendances between 2015 and 2016.  The data include patients who do not attend.  However, since the launch of the new iPMS patient administration system in 2016, the HSE has reintroduced text reminders for patients.  This measure is being rolled out on a phased basis.  The HSE will be assessing the benefits of the system and adding additional functionality throughout 2017.  The word &quot;reintroduced&quot; was used in the context of text reminders.  Were they used previously?  If so, why were they not maintained?  In the private sector text reminders are used by utility companies, telephone service providers, alarm companies and so forth.  Everything is connected to the customer's mobile phone.  Mobile phone operators alert their customers to the fact that their bills have been issued; waste companies remind customers to put out their bins in two or three day's time and so forth.  Reminders are issued regularly.  Such customer-focused, interactive systems are needed in the health service, particularly in the context of reducing waiting lists, because such systems would allow us to combat the challenges presented by such lists.  We must identify efficiencies that can be made.  In the context of the HSE assessing the benefits of the system, what criteria will be used?  I also want to know what additional functionality will be added in 2017.  <br\/><br\/>I am sure there is a lot more knowledge within the HSE than I have of technology that could be utilised.  I should not even be raising the matter in the House.  It should just be a <i>fait accompli<\/i>; it should be done.  I want to know if a text reminder system was in place previously and, if so, why it was not maintained.  I would also like to see the statistics for the rest of the country, given that we are looking at a 17% no-show rate in Limerick.  The reminder system should be rolled out across the country as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/><b>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne):<\/b>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I agree with him on the need to reduce non-attendance for hospital appointments.  According to the latest published HSE data, in 2016 there were over 135,000 patients who did not attend new appointments and over 343,000 patients who did not attend review appointments, comprising a general non-attendance rate of approximately 13%.  The cost of these non-attendances is difficult to ascertain.  In order to ensure outpatient clinics and the time of clinical staff are used to best effect, hospitals usually schedule a greater number of patients in order that clinics are fully utilised in the event that some patients fail to attend.  The administrative cost associated with non-attendance is approximately &euro;25 per patient visit.  Even more significant, however, is the loss of allocated clinical time which could have benefited another patient.  In that context, it is important that the HSE progress initiatives to reduce the numbers of people not presenting for outpatient appointments.<br\/><br\/> Technology has its part to play in a modern, efficient health care service.  The Department of Health has asked the HSE to identify quick, practical solutions to resolve some of the challenges that face the health service on a daily basis.  One of these challenges is to provide digital solutions in the area of non-attendance by patients for appointments.  One of the solutions eHealth Ireland has proposed is to provide a standardised national patient reminder service using SMS or email.  This solution has the potential to reduce the numbers who do not show up for appointments and, in addition, to allow current processes to be adapted and new procedures built to reallocate appointments slots to other patients.  This standardised national text reminder service project has been initiated.<br\/><br\/>Some hospitals such as those in the University of Limerick hospital group have a text messaging reminder service which is integrated with the patient administration system and allows a texting reminder service to operate.  This tailored solution will be evaluated when the project is in a later stage to determine if it would be appropriate as a standard approach across the system.  In addition, under the new outpatient reform programme, the hospital system will be moving to advanced booking systems which will give patients two choices of appointment time.  This has been shown internationally to dramatically reduce patient failure to attend.  There is also a further proposal to validate waiting lists using SMS reminder messages which would quicken the validation process, reduce workloads and increase efficiencies.  A pilot scheme is to be initiated shortly for both inpatient and outpatient services using SMS reminders for appointment validation purposes.  These initiatives are being progressed in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s outpatient waiting list action plan for 2017.  The Minister for Health will be communicating the details of these plans shortly.<br\/><br\/> Before I finish, I highlight the fact that the University of Limerick hospital group has been identified as a good performer in scheduled care.  For instance, as reported in the waiting list figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in the month of March, it was the hospital group with the lowest total number of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300028#AA00800","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493830500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It is welcome that the University of Limerick hospital group performed well in the context of scheduled care.  However, we must be more proactive in the use of the available technology.  In the public sector we always seem to be behind the eight ball when it comes to technology, whereas the private sector is often ahead of it.  We need to foster a culture within the health service that embraces technology and uses it efficiently to, first and foremost, help patients on waiting lists.  That would have a knock-on effect in assisting front-line staff, for whom I have the height of admiration for how they go about their duties and their commitment to their jobs.  Ireland is noted for the use of information technology in the private sector.  We were the largest exporter of software 17 years ago.  The text messaging service is 20 years old, but still we are pushing, scraping and fighting to try to have a text messaging system up and running in the public service.  It should have been up and running years ago.  We need to have more interactive technological systems in place in hospitals.  While the University of Limerick hospital group has been a good performer, 5,633 patients or 16% of the total did not attend their appointments in 2016.  I do not know how many of them were no-shows from 2015 and who had come back into the system.  We need to get behind the figures to have the necessary intelligence, data and analytics.  That is what happens in every business that survives; it gathers analytics and data and uses them to drive strategy, policy and decision-making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300029#BB00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1493830500,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with the Deputy who I know has a huge interest in ICT and how it should work.

It is for this reason that most hospitals over-estimate the numbers who will not show up when making outpatient clinic appointments.

Crime rates in the county have increased at a significant rate in recent weeks.  On the weekend of 25 February last, there were six home invasions in the Muckross, Loughguittane and Glenflesk areas of County Kerry.  These crimes were committed by thieves who made their way on a back road to the N22 route between Killarney and Cork.  Thousands of euro and significant amounts of jewellery were stolen.  These thieves even robbed all-Ireland medals from a house.  In another case, an elderly man in Ardfert was tied up for hours while a gang of thugs raided his house and took a substantial sum of money.  I will give one more example.  A sum of &euro;7,000 was recently netted by thieves who robbed cr&egrave;ches and a residential home in the Tralee area.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has been telling people that the crime rate in this country is going down.  I assure the House that crime has never been as high in County Kerry as it is now.  I have given a number of examples.  Elderly people in County Kerry and other parts of rural Ireland are terrified in their homes because of the increase in crime.<\/p>  <p>  People can talk about figures all they like.  We hear a lot about Operation Thor, but I believe all it is doing is taking these thugs off this country's network of main roads and motorways and onto the back roads of places like County Kerry.  Our garda&iacute; are under tremendous pressure when it comes to crime.  They are doing their level best with the resources they have, but they are up against it as they contend with sophisticated thieves, blackguards and cowardly thugs.  As I have said, the crime rate is very high in County Kerry at the moment.  A lot of crime is going unreported.  This is contributing to the fall in the figures.  People are just not reporting some crimes.  I did a quick and simple survey one time.  I rang seven people I knew who had crimes perpetrated against them to ask them whether they had reported those crimes.  Just three of them had done so.  Their attitude was that reporting crime makes no difference.  When people find that oil has been taken from their tanks, or that their garages have been broken into and their tools, chainsaws or personal bits and pieces taken, in many cases they decide not to bother reporting it because they believe there is nothing to be gained from doing so.  I believe all crime should be reported because that is the only way people will realise the seriousness of the situation.<\/p>  <p>  This Government, like its predecessor, has failed to protect our citizens in rural Ireland from the thugs who are breaking into homes to take people's hard-earned money.  We have all heard of cases in which lovely elderly people around the country have been tied up in their homes.  Breaking into the home of an elderly person to frighten, intimidate and steal from him or her is probably the most outrageous act that any person could do.  Elderly people should be respected, cared for and minded, but instead we have the scum of the earth going around.  I hope it might go out from here that these thugs are bad, dirty and horrible cowards.  That is all they are.  They would not be man enough to face another man who would be able to take them on.  I feel very strongly about those who beat up elderly people.  The rank-and-file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are dealing with these thugs are doing their level best with the resources they have.  I commend the garda&iacute; up and down the length and breadth of Ireland on the work they are trying to do.  We will take these cowards on.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and his Government colleagues to provide more resources so that they can be taken on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300030#CC00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1493831100,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste who cannot be present for this debate, unfortunately.  She asked me to speak on her behalf.  I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for raising this important issue in the Chamber this afternoon.  I assure him An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully monitors the activities of criminal groups affecting all areas of the country, including County Kerry, and is implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks.  The Deputy will appreciate the Garda Commissioner and her management team are ultimately responsible for the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas.  The T&aacute;naiste is advised that Garda management constantly monitors the distribution of resources in the light of crime trends and overall policing needs.  The matters raised by the Deputy this afternoon will be taken into account in that context in a very serious way.<\/p>  <p>  Significant resources have been provided to the Garda authorities, including an overtime allocation of &euro;88.5 million for 2017, to support large-scale policing operations, including Operation Thor.  The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity, including more than 52,000 crime prevention patrols and approximately 74,300 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have been approximately 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  The results are there and can be measured.  As the Deputy has said, Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The CSO's official recorded crime statistics for the fourth quarter of 2016 show a decrease of 30% in burglary offences compared to the previous 12-month period.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  CSO figures for the Kerry Garda division show that there were reductions of 54% in burglary, 20% in theft and 55% in robbery for the 12-month period of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  This parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.<\/p>  <p>  I agree strongly with the Deputy that people should be encouraged to report all crime.  The Deputy is correct when he says it is important for all crime to be reported.  Otherwise, we do not know where we are going.  I applaud the Deputy for his comments in this regard.  As part of the concerted strategy to combat burglary, the T&aacute;naiste made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015, which I know the Deputy has an interest in.  These provisions are now available to garda&iacute; to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.  The reduction in the volume of burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not be indicated in the overall detection rate for burglary.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 was commenced a year ago.  It introduced the DNA database, which provides garda&iacute; with investigative links, or hits, between people and unsolved crimes, including burglaries.  This powerful tool is now available to the Garda.  It is anticipated that this will assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300030#CC00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1493831100,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I do not want to get into a row about the statistics.

The Government remains committed to ensuring the Garda has the necessary resources to tackle crime, not only in County Kerry but in all our communities.  Underpinning all these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence across the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Four days after the shooting, Deputy Adams received in his Leinster House office a copy of the statement of charges relating to the arrest in January of that year of Crevan Mackin.  The following day he telephoned the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Five days later he wrote to both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The document revealed Mackin was arrested on 16 January 2015 when he was accused of being a member of an illegal organisation and possessing explosives.  It further stated An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believed he had access to six handguns, as well as explosives, ammunition and timing devices.  According to his family and his solicitor, Crevan Mackin was taken at one point from a Garda station to a house in Edentubber, County Louth, where two of the six handguns were recovered.  Later, Mackin was charged with membership of an illegal organisation but not with possession of the explosives or the weapons which he had admitted to being in his possession during the course of his interrogation and interviews.  His family claim that Mackin told them later that he did a deal with his Garda interrogators that, in return for working for them, he would not be charged with firearms and explosives offences.<\/p>  <p>  On 9 October 2015, two days prior to the death of Garda Tony Golden, Crevan Mackin, who had serious mental health issues and had access to several firearms, gave his former partner Siobh&aacute;n Phillips, a prolonged and unmerciful beating.  Such was the extent of her injuries that she required hospital treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Following that assault Siobh&aacute;n Phillips&rsquo;s parents spoke to the duty officer at Dundalk Garda station on 10 October 2015 when they wished to make a complaint regarding the assault which had taken place the night before on their daughter.  They were, however, refused an opportunity to make a statement at Dundalk Garda station.<\/p>  <p>  They then proceeded to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry on the same evening.  There the PSNI took photographs of the extent of the injuries.  After leaving Daisy Hill Hospital to return home, they flagged down a Garda car in Omeath and, again, tried to make a complaint about the assault which had taken place.  Again, they were told they were unable to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Being unable to make a statement on two occasions, the family were living in fear that night.  They barricaded themselves into their own home and turned off the lights because they had such a fear of Crevan Mackin, who had serious mental illness, had access to weapons and viciously beaten their daughter over a prolonged period.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable that victims of domestic violence are treated in this manner where they are refused the opportunity on two separate occasions to make a statement about an assault?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300031#DD00600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1493831700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter this evening on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who apologises that she cannot be present to take it.<\/p>  <p>  The killing of Garda Tony Golden at Omeath in October 2015 was a tragic loss for his family and for his colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All Members will share my view that Tony Golden was a hero who gave his life doing his duty as a garda while seeking to protect a vulnerable woman.  Whatever the nature of allegations that may be made, we must have the utmost sensitivity for those who have suffered so much as a result of these tragic events.  I think particularly of Garda Tony Golden&rsquo;s widow, Nicola, and his three children, as well as of Siobh&aacute;n Phillips who suffered terrible injuries.  We should not forget also the grief of Adrian Mackin&rsquo;s family.<\/p>  <p>  While it is important any issues of concern related to these tragic events are fully investigated, it is essential to remember the various allegations being made are just that - allegations.  The truth or otherwise of those allegations has not been established and there are ongoing processes set out in law to do that.  It would be prudent, therefore, not to jump to hasty conclusions.  Many of the concerns set out were raised previously with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and they were brought quickly to the attention of, and pursued with, the Garda authorities in the context of their ongoing investigation and review processes into the shootings and related matters.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality expects to receive a final report from the Garda authorities addressing these matters when the investigation and review are completed.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, recently announced its decision to initiate a public interest investigation into certain matters relating to these tragic events.  It indicated this public interest investigation will take place alongside the ongoing GSOC investigation of complaints relating to these events that were made previously.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the actions being taken by GSOC in accordance with its powers under the law.  These investigations must be allowed to take their course so that the truth, or otherwise, of certain allegations made can be established independently.

It is a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer.<\/p>  <p>  A Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation will not answer all the questions on this issue.

The GSOC investigation will not determine why Mr. Mackin's bail was reduced from &euro;20,000 to &euro;5,000, allowing him to be released or at whose request this was done.

We should make no mistake about it as they are watching it and there has been a huge amount of discussion about maternity services, which is fantastic, as I have been raising the maternity services issue consistently in this Chamber.<\/p><p>The recent controversy over the ownership and governance of the National Maternity Hospital has thrust the spotlight on to maternity services but the provision of maternity care for the women of this country is not a priority for this Government.  It is a priority for those people watching us and they are very interested in what happens in here because it directly affects the availability of the care they can access.  The Government's amendment is yet another exercise in patting itself on the back, a big &quot;well done&quot; for all the achievements it is in the process of actioning.  These are what it is just about to do any minute now.  It is a &quot;well done&quot; for publishing a strategy; well done indeed but the words are meaningless to those women who will wait years for a gynaecology appointment or the women who will today, next week and for the foreseeable future be denied a basic 20-week anomaly scan.<\/p><p>The 20-week anomaly scan is a screening test but in six of the nine maternity facilities in this State, these scans cannot be accessed as a matter of course.  One can only get them when clinically indicated.  If a woman has no screening, there is no way of determining what can be clinically indicated.  The Minister knows this, as do his officials and the Health Service Executive, HSE.  When we ask a question about those scans, we are told they are offered when clinically indicated and only at six sites.  In case the Minister is wondering why we need anomaly scans, I remind him of the case of Ms Jazmine Sands, a young woman whose baby, Isabella, was born in Kerry and rushed to Dublin.  This little baby was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome on 23 May 2016 and 12.01 p.m., weighing 5 lbs 1oz.  She was immediately rushed to the children's hospital at Crumlin, dying there a short time later.  Her mam had to endure an horrific journey after a caesarean section from Kerry to Dublin.  There was no way her baby would have survived and there was nothing, despite their best efforts, that the doctors and nurses could have done.  However, if the woman had access to a 20-week anomaly scan, the problem with her baby's heart would have been picked up and she would have had the opportunity to make arrangements to bring her family to Dublin.  She would not have left her family in Kerry had she known the only choice she could make was to have a bit of time with her baby and cherish it.  It should be a very basic right of a pregnant woman to access a 20-week anomaly scan and it is considered a very basic entitlement in most developed countries.<\/p><p>Maternity services have been neglected and the truth is women and babies are suffering on a daily basis because of this.  The motion calls on the Government to do not much more than implement its own policies and commitments but all we get are fine words without commitments, dates or a timeframe.  There is nothing concrete to give women any hope.  It is another strategy to add to the Government's collection but there is no specified action or date for when women can have access to this routine scan.  I have asked the Minister and the Taoiseach about this countless times but they have not been able to give a date by which we could say to women that they will able to access this very basic scan.<\/p><p>I also raise the issue of the new maternity hospital, as everybody is talking about it.  This motion seeks to ensure it will be kept in State ownership and the people providing the service will have the ability to deliver those services free of any religious interference.  The Bishop of Elphin was very clear, as the Minister is aware, in saying that where the church owns the land, canon law prevails.  That cannot be allowed to happen but we must have the new maternity hospital.  A young woman in my family gave birth at Holles Street about a year and a half ago to a beautiful baby boy but she was very sick afterwards and had to go to intensive care.  She could not have her baby with her because the woman in the bed beside her was grieving the loss of her baby.  That is why we need this hospital.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the building of our maternity hospital but we cannot have a position where the hospital would be controlled by anybody other than this State.<\/p><p>That must be legally guaranteed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300032#EE00500","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493832900,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Maternity care in Ireland has been in a state of crisis for many years.  Underfunding has led to a severe shortage of staff in hospitals, thus resulting in us lagging behind international standards.  Maternity services lack both midwives and obstetricians.  Ireland has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  There are 597 births per consultant obstetrician per annum in Ireland, compared to 268 per consultant in Scotland.  Midwives play a pivotal role in the health system, but an increased workload, stress and dissatisfaction with clinical practice have resulted in many midwives leaving for other areas of nursing such as public health and education.  For this reason, among several others, we must urgently address the environment in which midwives work to ensure we can retain adequate numbers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the serious problems pertaining to capacity, it is a damning indictment of the Government that most of the 19 maternity units do not offer foetal anomaly screening and that perinatal psychiatrists and other specialists are few and far between.  There is no doubt that a combination of these serious failings have led to tragedies that include deaths in health care settings across the State.  Since 2012, four hospitals in Portlaoise, Galway, Sligo and Cavan have been investigated following deaths, including neonatal deaths.  The Government is failing the women and children of Ireland.  Expectant mothers due to give birth in maternity hospital settings must be reassured that the care provided is of the highest standard.<\/p>  <p>  To add to the colossal difficulties in maternity hospitals, the recent revelation of plans to place the new National Maternity Hospital in the ownership of the Sisters of Charity is simply mindboggling.  Sinn F&eacute;in has welcomed the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus.  The current hospital on Holles Street is not fit for purpose.  However, the decision to give ownership of the new National Maternity Hospital to the Sisters of Charity is simply unbelievable.  In this day and age there should be absolutely no connection between the provision of health care services and religious orders.  A particular religious ethos should have no influence on clinical decisions.  This debacle must be resolved as a matter of urgency.  We must ensure the new hospital on the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus will remain entirely within public ownership and have legally guaranteed independence from all non-medical influence in its clinical operations within the laws of the State.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as promised in A Programme for a Partnership Government, there must be full and proper implementation of the national maternity strategy.  Foetal anomaly screening, with the necessary staff and equipment, must be provided in every maternity hospital.  I think of the case of baby Conor Whelan and his parents, Siobh&aacute;n and Andrew, from Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan.  Their loss and campaigning must receive a positive response.  The Birthrate Plus standard for midwifery staffing must be met, in addition to the recruitment of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists.  Patients should have access to an independent advocacy service and priority should be given to care for children with life-limiting conditions, as was recommended in the report on end-of-life and palliative care in Ireland by the Joint Committee on Health and Children in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The impetus behind these matters is, quite simply, a matter of life and death.  For far too long the State has failed women and children, particularly those who have lost their sons or daughters as a result of the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide the necessary care.  The acceptance and implementation of all that is contained in the motion have the potential to improve greatly the standard of maternity care.

The motion outlines a long list of shortcomings on the part of the State but handing over the National Maternity Hospital to the Sisters of Charity takes the biscuit.  We all know that a new hospital must be built and that it must be built as quickly and efficiently as possible.  However, it is unacceptable that the State should build the hospital and hand it over to the Sisters of Charity.  The State is responsible for the provision of health care for citizens, not the church.<\/p>  <p>  There have been too many cover-ups in the past and too many people were not, and still are not, held to account.  Most recently, there has been the Tuam mother and baby home scandal.  It follows a litany of scandals in which the church and State colluded, all under the guise of providing care.  Why would we wish to continue a practice with such a dark history?  Last week the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, appeared to have been taken aback by the backlash against this plan.  Is the Government so far removed from public opinion on this matter that it thought this was acceptable?  Is it so out of touch with reality and the society it governs that it thought people would be happy with it?  Women's health and women's rights must be at the core of the new hospital which must be State owned and State run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300033#FF00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1493832900,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about this important topic.  I commend my colleagues, Deputies Louise O'Reilly, Mary Lou McDonald and Kathleen Funchion, for their hard work in campaigning on this issue.  The figures speak for themselves.  Ireland has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the OECD.  Three Dublin maternity hospitals are operating with a 17% deficit in the numbers of staff required to run their services.  Most of the 19 maternity units in the country do not provide essential screening owing to the lack of specialised staff.  The women of Ireland deserve better than what they have been receiving from the Government.  The national maternity strategy must be implemented fully and resourced.  The Government must work to retain medical staff and provide the specialist service needed across the State.  The National Maternity Hospital must be built without delay and must be independent of all considerations, other than providing the best possible health care for pregnant women and their babies.<\/p>  <p>  As my party's spokesperson on education, I must make the point that the proposal to establish the new National Maternity Hospital in the ownership of a religious body is very concerning.  Recent reports show that various religious bodies owe the State hundreds of millions of euro in respect of the redress scheme for the survivors of abuse in State institutions, including schools.  In the immediate aftermath of these revelations the prospect of the National Maternity Hospital being gifted to a religious order has rightly outraged citizens across the State.  Anything other than complete independence for the new hospital is unacceptable.  The Government must get its act together and ensure the best possible care is provided for pregnant women and new mothers.  That must happen now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300033#FF00400","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1493833500,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>1.

<\/blockquote><p>I thank Deputies for giving me the opportunity to speak about our maternity services.  I acknowledge the constructive nature of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, in particular its focus on the legal mechanisms necessary to complete the new national maternity hospital at the St. Vincent's campus.<\/p><p>Too frequently maternity services make the headlines for the wrong reasons.  While any one loss or negative experience is one too many, in particular for the individuals and families concerned, it would be remiss and irresponsible of us not to acknowledge that Irish maternity services compare favourably with those of other countries in terms of safety and outcomes.  Of course, there is always room for improvement and to learn from past mistakes.<\/p><p>When it comes to maternity care, we not only know what we need to improve but we already know how we are going to do it.  To that end, Ireland's first ever national maternity strategy was published in January 2016.  It maps out the future for maternity and neonatal care to ensure that it will be safe, standardised, of high quality and offer an enhanced experienced and more choice to women and their families.  This strategy has been broadly welcomed and I have no doubt it was enriched by the more than 1,300 voices which contribute to its development.<\/p><p>Starting with this strategy, 2016 was a landmark year for maternity services.  In August I launched the HSE national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death and in December HIQA's national standards for safer and better maternity services were published.  These developments, when taken together, represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.<\/p><p>The development and publication of the national maternity strategy demonstrates a new and enhanced focus in this country on maternity care at policy and service delivery level.  I firmly believe that the strategy will fundamentally change how maternity care is delivered, improving the risk profile of the entire service in the process to the benefit of the approximately 80,000 families who access it every year.  The proposed new model of maternity care set out in the strategy consists of three care pathways: supported, assisted and specialised.  Such an approach means that every woman will be able to access the right level of care from the right professional at the right time and in the right place, based on her needs.<\/p><p>It recommends that services should be woman-centred and provide integrated team-based care.  It aims to increase choice for women at a very special, individual and private time for them and their families, while also crucially ensuring that services are safe.  The strategy outlines that a partnership approach should be taken, with women to be encouraged to maintain regular contact with maternity services throughout pregnancy and following birth and have access to all necessary information, all of which will be underpinned by the principle of informed consent. <\/p><p>Safety is the first and overriding principle.  Integral to this are guidelines to assess and place women in the appropriate risk category which will ensure that their care is managed in line with best evidence.  To this end, the strategy underlines that this new model of care will be underpinned by evidence-based guidelines which will provide the necessary patient safety assurances and help to ensure consistency and practice across the country.  The national clinical effectiveness committee has commenced the development of a national clinical guideline in this regard.<\/p><p>The strategy also supports the implementation of the HIQA national standards for safer and better maternity services.  The standards will provide a framework for maternity service providers to ensure that they are meeting the needs of women, their babies and their partners and that a consistent service is delivered across the country.<\/p><p>For most people, pregnancy and birth is a joyous life event.  Sadly, however, many families suffer a pregnancy related bereavement.  The strategy recognises the importance of improving and standardising bereavement care throughout maternity services.  The HSE national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death will ensure that clinical and counselling services will be in place to support women and their families in all pregnancy loss situations from early diagnosis from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death, as well as situations where there is a diagnosis of foetal anomaly that may be life-limiting or fatal.  I trust that they will ensure that all families who have the terrible experience of a pregnancy related bereavement will receive the care and compassion they need.<\/p><p>As I previously mentioned, a key pillar of the national maternity strategy is to ensure the safety of our services.  Since December 2015, each maternity hospital has published a monthly maternity patient safety statement as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer in his 2014 report on perinatal deaths in Portlaoise.  These statements contain information on metrics covering a range of clinical activities, major obstetric events, mode of delivery and clinical incidences.  These statements are publicly available on the HSE website, ensuring transparency.<\/p><p>Now that a clear and comprehensive strategic and policy framework is in place, our intention must turn to implementation.  To ensure that all of these plans translate into improved care and outcomes, we have put in place new structures which are dedicated to maternity care.  To that end, the national women and infants health programme has been established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services, strengthening such services by bringing together work that is currently undertaken across primary, community and acute care.<\/p><p>The programme will also oversee the establishment of maternity networks in each hospital group, the development of which will strengthen the operational resilience of smaller units.  This will result in a co-operative approach to service delivery which ensures that each hospital site within the network delivers care appropriate to the facilities and services available on that site.  Any future development funding for maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services will now be ring-fenced and allocated through this programme.  With its wide remit and dedicated expertise, it is envisaged that the programme will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers and ensure the appropriate allocation and targeting of new resources.<\/p><p>The programme will draw up a detailed action plan that will inform the full implementation of the strategy.  This work will include the identification of capital and revenue funding requirements which will, in turn, inform the annual Estimates process over the lifetime of the strategy.  The implementation group has held its first meeting and I expect the action plan to be completed in the coming months.<\/p><p>In the interim, work to implement the strategy has already begun.  In demonstration of the Government's commitment to the progressive development of maternity services, &euro;3 million in development funding provided for majority services in 2016 was allocated in line with the strategy and included funding for additional staff, including 100 midwives, the development of specialist treatment teams and the implementation of the maternal and newborn clinical management system.  Increased funding of &euro;6.8 million has been provided for maternity services in 2017, which will allow for the continued implementation of the strategy.<\/p><p>While it must be noted that the growing maternity workforce and the falling number of births are giving rise to improved staff to birth ratios, the strategy acknowledges the need to increase further the maternity workforce.  While the Private Members' motion points out that the overall number of obstetricians was one of the lowest in the OECD when last measured, significant recruitment has taken place since then.  As of February 2017, a record number of obstetricians, that is 142 whole-time equivalents, were employed within our maternity services.  This represents a rise of 25 since 2011 when the OECD data quoted in the motion was gathered, despite the decreasing number of births in the country since then.  The Government is committed to building on this progress.<\/p><p>We have also increased the number of funded midwife posts, including the recruitment of an additional 100 midwives in 2016, the allocation of whom to individual maternity hospitals was informed by the needs identified by Birth Rate Plus, an evidence-based workforce planning tool.  Currently, there are 1,583 whole-time equivalent midwives throughout the services.  I have been assured that the maternity strategy will make Ireland a more attractive place for midwives to work.<\/p><p>During recent engagement between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU nursing unions, agreement was reached on a number of specific measures to attract nursing and midwifery graduates back to Ireland and, indeed, to remain in Ireland.  This commitment has put in place a funded workforce plan for nurses and midwives, including 1,208 additional posts, 96 of which are additional midwives to support the implementation of the maternity strategy.<\/p><p>I want to return to the issue of anomaly scans.  While I accept that the provision of anomaly and dating scans is not uniform throughout the country, foetal anomaly scans are available in each hospital group.  We are working and must work to improve this further.  The national maternity strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  This issue is a priority for the new programme, and as a first step clinical guidance on routine detailed scans at 20 weeks will be developed.  In the meantime, the programme will work with the six hospital groups to increase access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.<\/p><p>In regard to co-location, the model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.  Government policy is, therefore, to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute hospitals.  Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical support.  On 10 March, a planning application for the new national maternity hospital at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The remaining stand-alone maternity hospitals in the Coombe, the Rotunda and Limerick will relocate to the campuses of St. James's Hospital, Connolly Hospital and University Hospital Limerick, respectively.<\/p><p>Tri-location with paediatric services ensures immediate access to on-site paediatric services when foetal or neonatal surgery is required.  The availability of these services will help to ensure the delivery of an optimum safe service, in particular for high-risk mothers.<\/p><p>I now want to deal specifically with the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to St. Vincent's campus, an issue which I know has been the subject of serious public concern in the past few weeks and has highlighted the need for a broader conversation we discussed during Priority Questions earlier.  I would like to make it very clear that in asking for time, my Department and I will work with both hospitals for reporting back to the Government and Oireachtas.  We will use this time to pursue solutions that address the issue of the ownership of the facility that is the new national maternity hospital.<\/p><p>The need for the new hospital is beyond doubt and I respectfully ask the House that we use this time to work on the issues and arrive at a solution which can deliver it.  While Holles Street has since 1894 served and continues to serve the women of Dublin, the building is no longer appropriate for our needs.  When completed, the new state-of-the art national maternity hospital at the St. Vincent's campus will give physical expression to the national maternity strategy.  I assure the House that the new hospital will have complete clinical, operational, financial and budgetary independence.  I will report back to the House with further detail in the coming month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300034#GG00100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493834100,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Deputy Billy Kelleher is sharing with colleagues and they have 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300035#HH00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1493834100,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I will take seven or eight minutes or thereabouts.<\/p><p>We welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposed move of the national maternity hospital to the St. Vincent's health care group in Elm Park, which has been generating headlines for the last couple of weeks.  This has stimulated a broader debate our society must have about the ownership of our health facilities and the ethos within them.  It is something we must address in the short, medium and longer terms.  I understand fully that divestment might have huge cost implications, but we must set in train a process whereby capital investment by the State in health facilities is retained in the ownership of the State itself while within hospitals owned by the State, there is clinical, ethical and medical independence free from any religious ethos.  That is the broader issue that has to be addressed in the longer term.  It will have huge cost implications and it should be approached in partnership.  We did it very effectively in Cork with the Erinville, St. Finbarr's and Bon Secours maternity hospitals, which had a Catholic ethos.  They amalgamated with the establishment of the maternity hospital at CUH, which is a State-owned facility run according to the laws of the land.  These things can be done with imagination and a willingness on everybody's part to engage in a meaningful way.  In Dublin the maternity hospitals at Holles Street, the Rotunda and the Coombe are all voluntary.  These three voluntary maternity hospitals cater for approximately 27,000 to 28,000 births annually.  We must not lose sight of where we are in terms of the State's provision of capital and current investment while these hospitals are retained in a voluntary capacity.<\/p><p>There are broader issues to address here.  On the national maternity hospital itself, we can come here and be very critical.  The Minister probably deserves an element of criticism.  However, we have to address the problems that are there now.  Everybody accepts that we need to move the national maternity hospital to St. Vincent's.  If that move fails, there will not be too many other hospitals on the south side of Dublin which could accommodate the national maternity hospital.  The best clinical outcomes are where there is co-location with an adult teaching hospital and St. Vincent's fits that bill in the context of the clinical supports available there.  What is fundamental is that there can be no interference in medical or ethical oversight by anybody.  The laws of the State must be sacrosanct in the context of what happens within the national maternity hospital and the problems that may flow from that hospital to St. Vincent's itself.  We have to be very conscious of the latter point also.  We must look at that.  The Kieran Mulvey report is not a legal agreement, but is rather a document which perhaps contains many compromises to get people off difficult hooks.  However, the Minister's obligation and our obligation as legislators is to ensure that investment in a capital project allows the State to have a charge on it or, hopefully, ownership where that can be achieved.  The other area that must be looked at is to bring certainty and clarity to the issue of medical, ethical and financial independence and oversight.<\/p><p>Over the last number of days there has been a great debate with an exchange of views from the present and former masters of the national maternity hospital.  The national maternity strategy has outlined in detail for some time the plans ahead for maternity services nationally.  I hope we can address this to the satisfaction of everybody and, more importantly, ensure there is a move and that women in Dublin have a proper maternity hospital with the proper infrastructure and medical services available.  I hope the month the Minister has requested bears fruit in that regard.  I urge him to use whatever means are necessary to progress the matter.  People have referred to CPOs and the like but, as I said earlier, it is a long time since we passed a Bill of attainder, picked out a group of people and seized their assets.  We have to work within the Constitution and the law.  As such the Minister must embrace this month, as must other actors, because the public needs to see certainty around the investment from the State and medical and ethical oversight.<\/p><p>On the broader issue of maternity services generally, we must accept, looking at the OECD figures, that we are falling very far behind in the number of obstetricians <i>per capita<\/i>here.  In fact, we have approximately half the number of obstetricians we require which, in itself, is a sad indictment of the fact that our maternity service, while comparable in terms of outcomes, involves the cutting of corners because of the huge pressure and stress on our maternity hospitals.  That is a given.  It is only the fact that we have wonderful midwives, consultants and other medical professionals that keeps this whole maternity service afloat.  We must accept that if we do not do something quickly on investment in personnel, we will have further difficulties in the years to come.  We see that where there are problems with staff, staff training and pressures on staff, there can be catastrophic adverse outcomes as incidents in certain maternity hospitals in this country in recent times have shown.  We must accept that there is a great deal of work to be done.  While we acknowledge the maternity strategy itself, there is a short-term issue around fetal anomaly scans and access to ultrasound.  Unfortunately, this is a regional issue.  While in Dublin one can access an anomaly scan, that is not the norm in other parts of the country.  It is something that must be addressed very quickly because every woman should be entitled to a scan where required.  The idea that one has to prioritise and assess risk to provide a scan is not acceptable.  We must invest in ultrasound and the personnel required to operate that service.<\/p><p>A number of motions were tabled.  There was a complaint about prayers in this place today, but one would nearly need divine inspiration to work out the amendments to the amendments.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled the motion and we welcome the debate on it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled an amendment but in the context of working together to ensure there is unity of purpose in advocating for maternity services, we will certainly accommodate Sinn F&eacute;in's motion in circumstances where there has been an inclusion of the ownership issue.  We have to be clear, however.  While we want to see the hospital in public ownership, I accept that may not be possible for many reasons.  The last thing I want to do is leave this place this year or the year after with the whole deal having unravelled.  That would leave us in a position where 8,000 to 10,000 births per year continue to be delivered in Holles Street because people would not compromise or come to the table to agree a solution.  I urge the Minister to use everybody and every means at his disposal to bring this to a conclusion for everybody's sake, primarily women in Dublin who have been giving birth in a substandard infrastructure in Holles Street.  Were it not for the staff working there, we would have had many more serious outcomes.  That has been seen in the last couple of days with the difficulties in the absence of co-location.<\/p><p>For all these reasons I ask the Minister to use the month wisely, and perhaps in future when announcements are made have all the t's crossed and the i's dotted before the fanfare is unfurled, because it creates difficulties in trying to bring these issues to finality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300035#HH00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493834700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>There is no doubt in saying the time of being born and the time of giving birth must be the most vulnerable times in anybody's life, for the infant being born and the mother giving birth.  As a nation, we absolutely owe these women and their children the very best of professional care and support in the highest end hospital with all the necessary equipment should anything go wrong.  I will begin with points on maternity care itself and then speak on the situation with regard to Holles Street and the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  It is very clear the provision of accessible, safe and high-quality obstetrician-led maternity services to all mothers and babies, regardless of where they live in whatever part of the country, must be the core objective of public health policy.  It is increasingly clear our national maternity infrastructure is under strain and needs serious review and investment to make it sufficient to meet the needs of the country over the coming years.  Any debate on maternity services needs to include a discussion on what greater role community midwifery can play, the urgent need for a greater number of consultant obstetricians, and the level of investment needed in physical infrastructure.  We agree with proposals to relocate the maternity hospitals in Dublin alongside acute hospitals and this absolutely makes sense.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the OECD reports on this, Ireland has one of the lowest ratios of obstetricians to patients and this tells it own story.  There is a huge need for investment in maternity and neonatal services throughout the country.  We believe obstetrician-led services must be a priority and we call for them to be in place in every maternity hospital in the country.  It is crucial that maternity services are protected and enhanced rather than downgraded.  We must look at those outside Dublin who must have high quality health and maternity services.  These include, as my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, said, anomaly scans, which are extremely important in monitoring the development of the baby in the womb.  They are carried out as a matter of routine in the main maternity hospitals in Dublin and Cork but only in some of our regional maternity units.  Women in Cavan and Monaghan who want to have an anomaly scan must travel to Dublin.  This is deeply unfair and a source of much anxiety for parents to be.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital on Holles Street is a place I know well.  My ten younger siblings were born there.

When the Minister announced last November there was going to be a relocation he received great accolades and there was great fanfare, and deservedly so if the details were what we thought they were.  However, the devil is in the detail, the details were not worked out properly and now it is a mess of the Government's own making.  It has not been open and transparent and it has caused massive confusion and anger among the public.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody agrees that a new maternity hospital is urgently needed.

I and my party find it very hard to believe the State would not own any maternity facility in which it is investing at least &euro;300 million.  The ownership would absolutely have to reflect this investment by the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Mulvey report, to which my colleague has referred, forms the basis of what is yet to be negotiated as a legal deal between Holles Street, the HSE and St. Vincent's group.  This surely would allow an opportunity to lock down the concerns on absolute clinical and corporate governance independence.  The new hospital must be completely ethically independent of any religion.  The Mulvey report also allows the Government to negotiate a line that should and will reflect the taxpayers' investment.  I understand from recent coverage a CPO was not legally possible at the time of the negotiations, but surely a 999 year lease may help to resolve the ownership issue.  We must acknowledge the land is owned by the sisters and they are donating use of it to the State.  Certainly locating the maternity hospital with a tertiary hospital is recommended best practice.  It is also a teaching hospital and located close to UCD.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il also believes any private income from maternity patients should be State owned, as is the practice now in Holles Street.  Many, if not all, of us in the House have received many e-mails and contacts over the past week on this issue.  Unfortunately it is the case the redress scheme and the dubious history of the religious orders with regard to mothers and babies has been caught up in this.  I accept it is a separate issue but, unfortunately, in the minds of the Irish people and the taxpayers these issues cannot be separated.  We absolutely have to do our very best to give comfort to those who are concerned and rightly so.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has asked for a month.  This month needs to be put to the best possible use to make this division.  It is very clear what the people need and want.  Having a very strict division between State and religion to ensure all the patients in the many years to come, including expectant mothers, mothers, young children and infants before and after birth, have the very best possible support and medical care not connected to a religious ethos.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300036#JJ00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1493834700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion as the Labour Party's spokesperson on health.  I wish I had much more time than I do because this is a very important issue for all of us.  In the time I have I want to focus on the need for independence of the new maternity hospital and the lack of staffing in maternity services, which the Minister knows is an issue about which I speak quite regularly at committee meetings and personally to the Minister.  I believe it is in our national maternity strategy.  I also want to speak about regulation.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the best efforts of clinicians and staff in our health services women are continuously let down by Governments in respect of maternity care in Ireland.  The controversy about the new national maternity hospital is only the tip of the iceberg.  Here we are in 21st century Ireland debating whether a religious order or the State should own a taxpayer-funded institution charged with providing maternity care to the women and young children of this country.  It is quite extraordinary that the Government would, aside from all else, consider gifting sole ownership of this incredibly important State-funded hospital to the Sisters of Charity, the same people who were party to a &euro;128 million redress scheme with the State.  Given what we know about how this order behaved, is there any other modern, developed country in the world which would actually act in this way?<\/p><p>Yet, in this country, we were going down that road.<\/p> <p> Only last week, we saw the resignation of Dr. Peter Boylan from the board of Holles Street, citing that he can \"no longer remain a member of a board which is so blind to the consequences of its decision to transfer sole ownership of the hospital to the Religious Sisters of Charity, and so deaf to the disquiet of the public it services\".   Further in his resignation letter he states, \"To believe the new National Maternity Hospital will be the only hospital in the world owned by a Catholic congregation to permit serialisation, IVF, abortion, gender reassignment surgery and any other procedures prohibited by the Church is naive and delusional\".  In a more warning manner he states that \"all women who will require transfer along the interconnecting corridor to the general hospital for specialist care will be, as you must be aware, transferred into an environment where there is no dispute that [a] Catholic ethos applies\".  I agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Boylan's comments and sentiments.  I have spoken to him at considerable length.  I believe he has done the State a huge service and has done it an even larger service in the last few weeks.  The influence of Catholic teaching arguably has no bigger impact than it would under maternity services.  Every hospital owned and funded by the taxpayer must be in a position to provide any and all medical procedures allowed under Irish law, not just currently, but we need to future-proof it, and that is not what St. Vincent's said.  This is simply not up for discussion.<\/p> <p> An interesting piece by a former Senator and oncology professor, Professor John Crown, raises further concerns about the clinical independence that might be an issue in the new maternity hospital.  He has said: \"I had the firsthand experience of having clinical trials delayed - not by long, because I fought them on it - on an issue where it was specified that contraception was required for patients who would be exposing themselves to drugs which could be horrific to a developing foetus\".  The idea of any religious interference in health care decision-making is absolutely, clinically wrong.  There is an indisputable need for the urgent construction of the new National Maternity Hospital.  I said it myself.  I have spoken on it on new numerous occasions.  The current situation of having three maternity hospitals operating on separate sites is unsustainable and contrary to clinical best practice.  I know that following persistent public pressure, the Taoiseach has come forward to say he can confirm that there will be complete clinical independence and that the Sisters of Charity will not have a majority on that board.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, now wants one month to decide the best course of action.  I have spoken with the Minister and have no problem with giving him that month, but I do say it in the spirit that he comes back with the right answer.  I do not want to spend too long with this, because we have to have a wider discussion on divestment, but this is up-front and now.  We need to solve this now and we need to deal with the wider issue.  We need to solve this issue in one month.  We cannot come away with the wrong answer.  There are many options out there including leasing, compulsory purchase orders and a number of others.  I do not buy the fact that we cannot do some of those.  This is a Chamber that bailed out the banks in 24 hours.  Surely we can sort out this and surely the Minister can sort this out in a month.  I have the same concerns the Minister had, because he was right three years ago in the Committee of Public Accounts, when he raised all those questions on how the Sisters of Charity could use the ownership of St. Vincent's as collateral in regard to developing their private practice, car parks and all the rest.  The Minister was right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300036#JJ00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493835300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300037#KK00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1493835300,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Now he should follow through on the sentiments of what he said three years ago and come back with the right answer in a month's time.<\/p><p>I want the Minister to address a number of questions.

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is having its conference today.  The Minister is probably addressing it at some point.  I do not know how he will be received, but if I was a midwife working under the current conditions - and my older sister has been a midwife all her life - I would be pretty angry with the Minister, because there is much stress, staff shortages and hardship that nurses and midwives have to face on a daily basis.  I say we will be dealing with this later on because we will be dealing with the public sector pay talks that are coming up.  One part of the solution to the future of maternity services in Ireland is to treat maternity workers properly and to pay them properly.  That refers to midwives in particular.  In that way, we should be able to recruit enough of them and to retain enough of them.<\/p><p>I want to address not just the issue of church and State and the question of St. Vincent's hospital and its future ownership, but the wider concept of what maternity and reproductive services should be about.  I do not think it is just about mother and child.  I think it is also about a whole range of services relating to our reproductive health that should be available to women.  I mentioned one earlier on, the question of tubal ligation.  It is not available in some hospitals in this country.  It should be available.  It is a simple procedure.<\/p><p>I would also like to mention the glaringly obvious fact that we are going to, in the next few months, hopefully deal with the outcome of the Citizens Assembly.  That assembly has expressed the sentiment that we have to repeal the eighth amendment and start to deliver access to abortion services in this company.  In that context, the ownership and control of maternity services is fundamentally important to the ability and the future of being able to deliver those services in this country.  I would like to move the amendment put by People Before Profit-Solidarity.  It is quite a long amendment, as most of them are that are before us tonight.  It deals with a number of issues, including the failure of the Sisters of Charity to compensate the victims of abuse and neglect in their residential homes.  It also deals with providing a spectrum of birth control services, including clear and quality information.  I would like to ask the Minister, and maybe he could refer to it in his reply, when we can see and if it is possible to fast-track the Bill that is before us to do away with bogus abortion information clinics.<\/p><p>These are cropping up as a real problem for the women in our society who are in a crisis pregnancy and seeking guidance.<\/p> <p> Bogus abortion information clinics, sometimes in receipt of State funding, are continuing to operate with impunity.  They are not regulated.  It is ironic that they are not regulated but information centres that give out real, proper, decent health information are indeed regulated.  There is a Bill before the House on that and we should make every effort to try and fast-track it, if we are serious about dealing with women's reproductive health in all its aspects and not just in the narrow confines of mother and baby, which of course are extraordinarily important.  I have many friends and neighbours who have been through the horrors of having to carry a dead foetus for many weeks under the Irish maternity service because of the fear of the eighth amendment.  Some hospital specialists are never sure that the heartbeat is gone.  They might be 99% sure but not 100%, and therefore the women have to carry the foetus for another few weeks until the doctors can be sure.  It is mental and physical cruelty for the women involved.  We have to move on and move into the 21st century.  Our amendment addresses much of that.<\/p> <p> I welcome many of the other amendments and motions as well.  There are many similarities.  What goes to the heart of this debate is the elephant in the room that we must not avoid mentioning, and that is the control of State services by the Catholic Church.  I am sure that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is probably tired of us mentioning this.  He gave what I regard as quite a confusing answer earlier today.  What he says is not what the bishops say, and it is certainly not what the Sisters of Charity say.  Somebody is telling the truth and somebody is not.  We need to get to the bottom of that. <\/p> <p> The Minister is asking for a month.  I dearly hope that the Irish people do not give him that month.  We have waited too long for equality, for proper treatment for women in this country, and for us to be taken seriously so that the Catholic Church are no longer dominating our lives.  I hope that the people of this country keep the pressure on the Minister and insist that the church have no say in the new maternity hospital.  It will be wonderful once it is delivered, as long as the Sisters of Charity do not get a say on the board of management or any other aspect of that hospital.  We need that copper-fastened, iron guarantee from the Minister.  If he cannot give it now I worry that he might not be able to give it at all in one month's time.  I hope that the pressure is kept up by the march next weekend by Parents for Choice - happening at 2 p.m. from Parnell Square for those who are interested in attending - and beyond that where parents are lobbying Deputies and insisting that we finally put an end to the interference of the Catholic Church in our maternity services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300037#KK00800","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493835900,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Regardless of the justifiable public outcry over the handling of the new national maternity hospital and the prospective ownership of that facility being given to a religious order, this motion is incredibly timely.  There is no doubt that our maternity services are in desperate need of reform.  It is something that we need to discuss.  The best response that the Government can come up with is that we compare favourably to other countries.  Do we, and if so, which countries?  I would not like to be compared to them.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at some of the facts.  Between 2011 and 2013 there were 27 maternal deaths.  These were otherwise healthy women who went in and lost their lives in childbirth or shortly afterwards.  There were inquests in only three of those cases.  In 2014 there were 365 reported cases of severe maternal morbidity, but our data is incomplete because not all of the maternity hospitals participated in that.  Between 2007 and 2015 the HSE incurred a staggering &euro;66 million in legal fees arising from maternity cases involving serious injury or death to women or babies.  During the same period the HSE, through the state claims agency, paid out an even more staggering &euro;282 million in damages in maternity cases.  That is 116 times more paid out in legal settlements and fees than the extra &euro;3 million that is being given to the new national maternity strategy.  Unless that culture of litigation, denial, lack of accountability and lack of oversight is dealt with our problems will continue.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that one of the key reasons for our problems is the significant under-staffing level of midwives and doctors across the State.  Meanwhile, reports and reviews into adverse incidents are either not made available publically or they are badly delayed.  The review of adverse incidents in Portiuncula hospital, for example, was supposed to be available by mid-2015.  We still do not have it.  We did discover last week, however, that the hospital was carrying out a secretive review of care, with a doctor even ignoring advice and saying that he did not see the reason why there should be any review at all.  We have to deal with these issues, because our maternity services are consistently running at sub-optimal levels, which is undoubtedly leading to trauma for women and their families and to catastrophic outcomes because of the lack of accountability and the completely inadequate and non-binding HSE open disclosure policy.  What we need is a statutory duty of candour in order to deal with these cases.  It is more than urgent.  It is one of the reasons why I moved the Coroners Bill 2015 and why that is so critically needed, yet we still do not know whether the Government has passed a money message even though the Committee for Justice agreed more than six months ago that it would go to committee stage next week.  <\/p>  <p>  We need accountability and openness if our services are going to improve.  The widowers who lost their wives and the mothers of their children can testify to the failures of our maternity services and the need to change.  We know from the eight inquests held between 2007 and 2015 into the deaths of women in our maternity services that vital information was withheld.  They were often not privy to internal investigations and reports until the HSE was ordered to produce them in public hearings by the Coroner's offices.  Although hospitals and the HSE indicated that they would change procedures and protocols, those were not implemented and carried through.  That is utterly devastating for those families.  It is not an exaggeration to say that if the HSE recommendations issued on foot of the tragic death and inquest into the death of Tanya McCabe had been made enforceable national policy then Savita Halappanavar may not have died.  If the inquest into Dhara Kivlehan's death had not been delayed for four years - she died in 2010 and the inquest was in 2014 - then Sally Rowlette, who died in 2013 in the same hospital of the same condition, leaving four children, may not have died.  These are very urgent issues that need to be addressed.  It shows systemic failures and a lack of openness in our system.  We know that there are countries across the EU which have much better health outcomes than we have.  We need proper audit and genuine open disclosure.  We have to have automatic inquests into maternal deaths in order for maternity services to improve.  <\/p>  <p>  It is unforgivable that in this day and age that fetal abnormality scans are not available as a matter of course to women.  The Minister has told us over and over again that all hospital groups offer such scans, but the reality is that the scans have to be implemented by doctors.  Women outside of major centres have to travel, and the consequence is that abnormalities are not always picked up.  It is not good enough.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the motion, but it does not go far enough.  That is not a criticism, it is a point of observation.  The national maternity strategy is far from flawless.  The language in it is feeble.  We talk about woman-led care, when there has been a deliberate decision not to have midwifery-led care because there is some seemingly mythical and highly polarised debate out there about midwifery care.  I reject that.  I would say that it is far more likely that expensive private obstetric practices are the ones who are worried about midwives.  No one else is.  Midwifery-led care is the way forward.  In Scotland they have 18 free-standing or along side midwifery led units serving a population the same as Ireland, yet we have two pilot schemes in Cavan and Drogheda.  <\/p><p>There has not been a single sod turned to provide even one midwifery-led unit in Ireland, despite the national maternity strategy making promises on the issue over 14 months ago.  The Scottish national maternity strategy provides that every woman will have continuity of care provided by a primary midwife who will provide the majority of her antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care.  The input of an obstetrician is an addition, but the provision of care is centred on the midwife, which is best for the State, health outcomes for women and the public purse.<\/p> <p> The national maternity strategy is non-statutory, which is a huge problem.  It is only the third national document on national maternity services since the early 1950s, but because it is non-statutory, it is not binding.  We can refer to A Vision for Change which is a lovely vision, but it does not tally with the reality.  The Government has one month in which to look at the maternity hospital and we will see what happens, but St. Vincent's University Hospital was built with public money.  Is it not ironic that, in 1972, Noel Browne was questioning the funnelling of public money and cash into a hospital for the Sisters of Mercy?  There should be no debate on this issue.  It has to be sorted out as it is a public hospital which was built with public money and should be publicly owned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300038#LL00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493836500,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I wish to concentrate on the National Maternity Hospital and the absolute necessity for a new hospital to replace the hospital on Holles Street which has outgrown its usefulness.  St. Vincent's University Hospital is the ideal location for a new maternity hospital because there will be many add-on benefits from co-locating it there.  Many pregnant women have diseases which are complicated by their pregnancy and many develop diseases because of pregnancy.  It is essential, therefore, they have the expert services that will be available to them on site at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  Nobody would argue with the location, but the care of pregnant women must be the central part of this debate, not the site or its ownership.  The central argument should be about the best facility for the care of women.  The mastership model is very important and must be retained as it will ensure clinical governance in the best interests of the patient.  The mastership model should be extended to other maternity hospitals because it is the most efficient form of management.  An increase in the numbers of obstetricians and nurses is absolutely essential also.<\/p>  <p>  The ethos of the hospital is of absolute importance.  It must be free from religious influence.  In a modern multicultural society such as Ireland, the best standards of obstetric care must be followed within the governance of the hospital.  They must be within the laws of the land, whatever they might be in five, ten or 50 years' time.  The board must have clinical, financial and operational independence.  We need to look beyond five years and even beyond 30 because the hospital will have a finite life and will not last forever.  The Minister needs to work out a way to ensure the hospital will have no material value to the Sisters of Charity.  It is within his competence to make sure the sisters will not be left with a disposable asset.

There is no doubt there are many shortcomings in our maternity services.  While the maternity strategy is to be welcomed, it is meaningless unless it is adequately funded and implemented.  That process needs to be accelerated in order to bring our services up to modern standards and made fit for purpose.<\/p><p>I want to concentrate on the issues surrounding the proposed move of the National Maternity Hospital.  While I have some sympathy with the Minister who inherited this situation, it is not acceptable in any circumstances to proceed with the transfer of ownership of the hospital as proposed.  Based on what we know of the agreement brokered last November, transferring ownership of a &euro;300 million State asset to private interests is utterly unacceptable to the public.  People are outraged by that.<\/p><p>The composition of the board is not acceptable under any circumstances.  It is proposed to have four, four and one, with the one expert person being appointed effectively by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  By any standard the proposed board structure gives St. Vincent's Healthcare Group a five-four majority on the board.  That is quite clear from the details of the agreement.<\/p><p>It is incomprehensible for people that the Minister is proposing to set up a new company that is wholly owned by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  There is no justification for that and people are horrified.  They cannot understand how that was agreed to.<\/p><p>On clinical governance, the diagram in the Mulvey report shows that the master of the National Maternity Hospital along with a number of other clinical directors will be answerable to the overall clinical director of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, who in turn is answerable to the CEO of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, who in turn is answerable to the board of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Under no circumstances can that be considered clinical independence; it simply is not the case.<\/p><p>The Minister has been landed into this.  He signed up to this agreement last November, which was a mistake.  It was a mistake to welcome that agreement, as the Taoiseach also did.  Now that the detail of that agreement has come out, it is utterly unacceptable to the Irish public.  The Minister has been at pains to talk about various safeguards.  He has talked about reserved powers and a golden share, neither of which will carry any weight in law under the terms proposed at the moment.  There are big legal questions over whether there is such a thing as a golden share, but that can come into play only within the boardroom and the Minister will not be in the boardroom.  The idea of a golden share is deceiving people.  Perhaps the Minister has been deceived on that, but it does not carry any weight, nor do reserved powers.  They have no meaning in a subsidiary that is 100% owned.<\/p><p>In a letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today, I pointed out a severe constitutional impediment to having any kind of independence for ownership transfers to a religious organisation.  I set out the clear grounds and the case law in this regard.  The Minister talks about being solution-focused.  I hope he will bring forward solutions within the next month, but those solutions cannot entail the transfer of ownership of the new National Maternity Hospital to any outside agency.  This is a public hospital.  It is publicly funded and should be publicly owned in its entirety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300040#NN00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1493837100,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I also commend Deputy O'Reilly on tabling this motion, allowing us the opportunity to present the arguments.  There seems to be clear agreement that, as anyone who is acquainted with the Holles Street facility knows, the National Maternity Hospital cannot stay as it is and must move.  Given the medical choices, St. Vincent's Hospital is the obvious location.  Not only is it an excellent hospital in my experience, but co-location on that site allows for incredible efficiency and the ability to deal with patients in a far more effective way.  I do not know any other site on which it would be appropriate to locate the new National Maternity Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  There is also clear agreement on the need for medical independence.  Central to this is the realisation that in all likelihood - it is up to the people - we will move towards a repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  In any future system, we cannot completely legislate for every different eventually.  The future arrangements will need to put the centre of responsibility in the relationship between the mother and the doctor, and give them the capability to provide the best service to the mother.  In those circumstances we have to be certain of the medical independence of that doctor to provide for the mother.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, I have not heard a single dissenting voice from anyone who does not believe the hospital must be in complete public ownership.  That should involve not the creation of a lease arrangement but rather the transfer of ownership of the site to the State so that there is no uncertainty or lack of clarity on the ownership.  Along with a number of other Members, last week I pointed out that the mission of the Sisters of Charity surely now lies in the work they are doing in combatting the trafficking of women, in addiction counselling services, in climate change, in caring for the poorest of the world where they are active, and not in the ownership or running of a general public hospital.  In those circumstances they should be gifting the site for this hospital to the State.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister that we need to go beyond that and look at the wider issue of ownership of our hospitals which has been built up in a haphazard way with a range of different ownership structures, with approximately 20 public hospitals in the care of a variety of religious orders.  As we go through this process we should be looking at mechanisms to arrange for the transfer of ownership.  It is time for the State to step up, to manage and to accept its responsibilities.  In the past that was not the case and it is now time for us to do that.  Included in this process we must ensure we have ownership of those hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  I add two other elements that have not been considered.  One is the issue of the private or public nature of this hospital.  I disagree with Deputy Harty; I have concerns over a master-led system.  What I have seen of our National Maternity Hospital is that it is master led.  Part of that involves highly lucrative well-paid positions for masters who run a private system to their own benefit.  I have serious questions and concerns over creating a new National Maternity Hospital that will replicate a private facility within a public building; that should be just as much an issue of concern.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the nature of the service, based on the history of the active management system.  I am not an expert; as a man, I cannot speak with any real authority, but those I trust and care for do.  There are questions about the master system which was all about the doctor and not about the patient or the midwife.  That active management system should be also called into question as we review the National Maternity Hospital.  Let us have a public hospital of which we can be proud in every way, caring first and foremost for and centred on the patient and the doctor-patient relationship we need to provide for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300040#NN00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1493837100,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Cullinane, who is sharing time with Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and McDonald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300040#NN00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1493837100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>It is difficult to understand why the Government even tabled an amendment to our motion.  In the first instance the motion simply acknowledges failures which even the Minister agrees have existed in our maternity services for a number of years.  I will not recite them; they are listed in the motion.  It also acknowledges and supports the findings of various independent reports, which I am sure the Minister will also accept.  It further acknowledges commitments given in the programme for Government and commitments made by the Government itself.  It then calls on the Government to do things on which, as Deputy Eamon Ryan has said, there is broad agreement in the House.  If there is broad agreement, why have the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party tabled amendments?  I cannot understand that because I think the motion is straightforward.<\/p>  <p>  The only reason I can come up with is that the Government has a difficulty accepting a motion calling for complete separation between the State and the Church on maternity services.<\/p><p>We cannot have a situation in which any religious congregation or order has any level of control of any maternity service in this State.  To me, that seems to be the problem for both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on this issue.  That is for them to answer, but we in our party are very clear that for all of the right reasons, which many Members across all parties have articulated, there simply cannot be any situation in which any religious congregation can have any level of input or influence in the running, management or ownership of any national maternity hospital.<\/p> <p> In the short time I have, I wish to quickly deal with staffing problems for nurses and midwives in maternity services, as well as in our hospitals generally.  It is an area and an issue that is preventing public health services from delivering the level of service that people need.  We see wards being closed in hospitals across the State.  We know there is a shortage of midwives and nurses.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation have published report after report and figure after figure that show that we are spending much more money on agency staff because we are simply not employing the front-line staff that are necessary.  We know that when Fine Gael came into power in 2011, &euro;127 million was spent on agency staff.  That has doubled over the last number of years.  That is not just spent on nurses; it is also spent on midwives.  That is a real problem as well.  We want to make sure that the women of Ireland have the best possible maternity services.  We want to ensure that the resources are being put into the system.<\/p> <p> I have been told by my colleague that Fianna F&aacute;il will be withdrawing its amendment.  I welcome that because I believe there should be all-party support for this motion.  I know one of my colleagues wants to come in so I will finish by calling on the Government to also withdraw its amendment.  Why not send a clear message out from this House - Government and Opposition - that we want the best for the women of Ireland, the best possible maternity services and the complete separation of church and State?  In the Minister's absence, I was pointing out that the Fianna F&aacute;il party has withdrawn its amendment.  Why can the Government not do likewise?  What is so objectionable in our motion that the Government cannot support it?  Would it not be better if a strong, coherent and consistent voice came from this D&aacute;il that we want to do the best we possibly can for the women of Ireland and have the best possible maternity services, which is all this motion does?  I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, for tabling the motion in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300040#NN00600","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493837700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I will begin by thanking and commending our colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, for tabling this motion and for doing so at this time.  I think we are in agreement, despite the fact that we have regularly commended ourselves for having the best maternity services in the world - it almost became like a catch-cry or a matter of national honour - that there are massive deficits and shortfalls within our service provision.  This motion sets all of that out: the shortages in consultant obstetricians and other specialist staff; the operational deficits in midwifery staff; the operational deficit of a magnitude of 17% in the Dublin maternity hospitals; and the lack of fetal anomaly screening, which has been referred to.  I also want to register and recognise the lack of perinatal psychiatrists.  There are only four, as we know, to cater for the entire State.  I believe there are part-time positions in addition to that.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the statistics - though these are never just matters of statistics, these are pregnant women - that 16% of women attending maternity services are at probable risk of depression.  These statistics are from the Well Before Birth study.  We know that risk of depression increases as pregnancy advances.  Some 12.9% of women are at risk in the first trimester, 13.8% are at risk in the second and 17.2% are at risk in the third.  We know, of course, that for many women post partum after delivering their babies, it is not merely a case of the baby blues.  We can have full-blown post-natal depression, which is a most debilitating condition.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has commended and extolled the virtues of the maternity services strategy.  While we have a strategy, I want to reiterate that we had a strategy for mental health service provision way back when called A Vision for Change.  The thing about these strategies is that they have to be resourced, driven and delivered.  There is much work to do.<\/p>  <p>  The motion makes reference to the really horrific circumstances of mother and child mortalities or injuries.  It cites Portiuncula University Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Portlaoise, Cavan and Drogheda.  There was a time when week on week and month on month one waited in the horrific expectation of another bad story from our maternity services for the women of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  These matters are matters of women's health.  In very real terms, they are matters of life and death in many instances.  They are also about choice.  They are about women's choices, decisions, autonomy and capacity to make decisions for ourselves in partnership with medical practitioners.  In that regard, I come to the issues of ownership of the new maternity hospital at St. Vincent's.  It is entirely outrageous and unacceptable that the Minister would come to the floor of the D&aacute;il in the year 2017 and make the statement he made earlier welcoming the confirmation by the board of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that any medical procedure that is in accordance with the laws of this State would be carried out at the new hospital.  The Minister might ask why I would cite that as outrageous.  It is entirely unacceptable in this day and age and at this time that the Minister would require such a confirmation from the board of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It has to be taken as an absolute given that services in accordance with the law are provided in publicly-funded hospitals.  Sin &eacute;.<\/p>  <p>  There is a bigger question about divestment across the health services, but we need to start with this hospital.  I have lost count of the number of women in particular who have asked me why in the name of God the Catholic Church would want to own, control or even influence a maternity hospital.  That is the question out there.  In addition, I have lost count of people who have said to us collectively as Members in this House to make sure that does not happen.  The history of interference and of religious dogma blinding good medical practice is writ large.  The cost of that policy was very high for women in this State.  To this day, it remains a problem for us.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Government is in fact withdrawing its amendment.  I am very glad to hear that we will have cross-party agreement on this matter.  If nothing else, we can credibly and collectively give a response to the public that we have heard what the public mood and view is.  That is for first-class health care for our women without interference of ideology or dogma and for women to come first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300041#OO00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1493837700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I want to thank everybody who has contributed and who will contribute to what I believe has been an important and good debate.  I just want to pick up on a few points.  I will begin with the issue of safety.  This is an issue that many people have raised throughout the debate.  Safety is and must remain an absolute priority in our health service in general.  The Department and the HSE continue to work together to make improvements in this regard.  I referred earlier to the monthly publication of the maternity patient safety statements.  In terms of wider patient safety developments, last December I launched a new national patient safety office.  This is an office located within my Department to prioritise and drive patient safety work in this area.<\/p><p>I have directed the office to work on a range of initiatives including new legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the measurement of patient experience, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda.  Within the programme of legislation, it is intended to progress the licensing of our public and private hospitals.  <\/p> <p> I want to pick up on the point raised by Deputy Daly about why we do not say it is midwifery centred.  I refer her to page 3 of the strategy which states that the mother is at the centre of the strategy.  We have avoided as far as possible professional-centric terms such as consultant-led or midwifery-led as they incorrectly place an emphasis on the profession rather than on the woman.  In future, maternity care in Ireland will be provided in an integrated manner by a multi-disciplinary team with women seeing the most appropriate professional based on their need.  <\/p> <p> At its core, the agreement that has been mediated by Kieran Mulvey between the two hospitals ensures and endeavours to ensure a full range of health services.  We have heard the master of the maternity hospital and the former master, Professor Keane, on this.  I welcome and acknowledge on the record of the House the further confirmation by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that any medical procedure in accordance with the laws of the State will be carried out in the new hospital.  I have made it clear that I want to use this month to further engage because I have heard public concern about this.  I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make available that information to the House and to Government.  I hope this will allow the necessary clarity on the issues of concern that have been raised in advance of any contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this agreement.  I have heard a lot of people talking about secret agreements.  I refer people to the Department of Health's website and a statement on 24 November which was published when the announcement was made by the Taoiseach and me.  It talks about much of the detail people are raising in the House.  People are right to raise it but on 24 November much of that information was published.  <\/p> <p> It is also important to talk about the process to date.  If this were straightforward one would suggest many people would have done it.  I am not afraid to address this issue and to work with people in the House and in both hospitals to make sure we get this right.  We have two voluntary hospitals.  People talk about the national maternity hospital as a publicly owned hospital.  It is a voluntary hospital.  Legally the Archbishop of Dublin is the chair of that hospital.  He does not play an active role but legally he is its chair.  There are a number of religious people on the board of the national maternity hospital.  The Minister of the day has no such golden chair or veto.  It is important that we look at this in the context that two voluntary hospitals have to come together to deliver a new national maternity hospital.  We had three mediation processes, two of which predate my time in this position.  It is important to acknowledge we have an agreement between two hospitals; we do not have the legal and contractual arrangements in terms of the running of the new hospital.  We have the document to which the hospitals have signed up.  This is how they envisage working together.  There is now an onus on the State and me to try to put in place the legal and contractual arrangements.  We are not talking about just building a hospital.  When we talk about co-location we are talking about two hospitals working together.  We are talking about sharing ICUs, high dependency units and consultants.  We are talking about a woman in need of emergency care going down a corridor bringing her from a maternity hospital into an adult acute hospital.  It is appropriate for the adult acute hospital to want input into patient care and arrangements in terms of the overall running of a campus.  It is important to say that.  <\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Kelly, I am terribly consistent on these matters.  The issues I raised at the Committee of Public Accounts on St. Vincent's is exactly what we are making sure will not happen.  We now, as a State, put in place  liens so that a hospital cannot mortgage or borrow off buildings in which the State invests.  That is right and proper.  There is space to further examine the ownership issue.  I have been very clear about that.  There are a number of creative issues that can be looked at in that regard, including the issue of a long-term lease.  <\/p> <p> On the issue of clinical independence, it is important to say the agreement states it in black and white.  People talk about church and religious interference.  The agreement states there will be no religious interference.  It is there in black and white.  It is my job to make sure it is absolutely copperfastened in contractual and legal arrangements.  I am entirely committed to that.  Let me be very clear when speaking to the women in this country.  We will not build any hospital that does not provide women with access to every health service they need today and any services that may be legal in this country in the future that are not currently legal.  I cannot be clearer than that.  The full range of services and full clinical independence will be provided at this hospital.  People said the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act would not be implemented in a number of these voluntary hospitals.  We now see it is not the case.  We will make sure we get this right.  There has been a broader conversation.  It is important.  Deputy McDonald said sin &eacute; and I get the point she makes.  When we say sin &eacute;, at least 15 of our hospitals today are voluntary hospitals.  I pose this as a question rather than something to answer this evening.  Are we now saying as a country that if we invest in any voluntary hospital we must own the asset?  If we are saying that, it is not without consequences.  It is a conversation we need to have.  We need to have it in the responsible structured way we had the conversation on education in 2012 with the forum on pluralism and patronage.  I intend to bring proposals on this to Government in the next month that I hope can facilitate a conversation that quite frankly the country is already having and that we in the Oireachtas and Government need to participate in.  <\/p> <p> I could pick holes in elements of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and we could debate them politically back and forth and debate the numbers and the OECD numbers but in the interest of bipartisanship I will not.  It is an important issue and in the interest of the House wanting to send a message that collectively we are committed to working together to improve our maternity services and that we want to see the issue of ownership addressed in the conversations my Department will now have with the two hospitals, I will withdraw my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017050300041#OO00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493838300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Like many other Deputies in this Chamber, I have been contacted by members of the public who are deeply angry and upset at the mess surrounding the new national maternity hospital.

Treatment should be based on the needs of the patients within the laws of the land.  End of story.  How can the Government justify spending &euro;300 million of taxpayers' money on a maternity hospital and then simply hand it over to a religious organisation?  The claim by some that the Sisters of Charity must own the hospital because it is built on their land is pure and utter rubbish.  There are many options open to the Government if only it would show a bit of back bone.  The Department of Health seems to be all over the shop on precisely what treatments would and would not be available.  For example, most people find it absolutely outrageous that the availability of a standard procedure such as IVF is being brought into this debate.  The view of Sinn F&eacute;in is that this hospital is desperately needed.  Our maternity services are overcrowded and understaffed while our facilities are crumbling.  The new national maternity hospital should be built as soon as possible.  Having said that, the Government must ensure the new national maternity hospital remains entirely within public ownership and that the Sisters of Charity have no part in the running of this facility.
