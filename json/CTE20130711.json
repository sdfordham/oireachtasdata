I have a brief presentation that should take no longer than 15 minutes.  It highlights the key activities of my organisation in 2011.  We can take questions subsequently.<\/p><p>  I will give the background to the organisation, provide a macroeconomic update on the industry and outline some of the key highlights across our three main customer divisions.  These divisions cover fisheries, aquaculture, business development and innovation, and training.  Training is actually part of the fisheries division but we will highlight what we did in respect of it also.<\/p><p>  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is the seafood development agency.  It is our role to promote seafood development.  We have bases around the country, in the main in the fishing ports.  The organisation, a State organisation, was founded in 1952.  We like to see ourselves as providing an integrated service to everyone in the seafood sector, be they fishermen, processors or fish farmers.<\/p><p>  We have 125 staff, which number is reduced from 175 in 2009.  We have, therefore, had a considerable reduction in staff since 2009.  We have five key strategic objectives.  The first concerns adding value to the fish we currently land, be it farmed or caught in the wild.  The second is scaling the sector, in that we believe there is a big opportunity to grow the sector from its current turnover of approximately &euro;850 million to in excess of &euro;1 billion.  To do that, we need large-scale operators.  The third concerns the critical supply of raw materials.  There is a big future in processing in Ireland and adding value to catches.  To do this, we need to increase the volume of raw material supplied by various means.  Fourth, sustainability is critical.  Anything we do in the sector must take into account the sustainability of stock.  Fifth, if we are to grow the sector, it is imperative that those involved have the requisite skills to enable them to maximise the opportunity that exists.<\/p><p>  Broad figures for 2011 show that the sector was worth approximately &euro;750 million.  The negative aspect of this was a 4% reduction, as one would have anticipated, in the domestic economy.  Difficult times were experienced.  We believe this levelled off during 2012 and 2013, but 2011 was difficult for those in the domestic retail sector.  The export position is much better.  During 2011, we recorded a 13% increase in exports, a very sizeable gain.  We saw double-digit growth in 2012, as high as 17% or 18%.  There has been growth in excess of 30% over a two-year period.<\/p><p>  Some 11,000 people are employed in the sector.  It is critical that they are employed in coastal areas where, as we have said on numerous occasions, there are very few economic alternatives.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the current market focus of exports.  Not surprisingly, Europe is our biggest market.  Dependency on this market has reduced slightly over recent years.  What we have seen is growth in Asia and Africa, primarily in respect of our pelagic species.  There is very little trade with North America, which we regard as an opportunity.  We envisage major opportunities for the sector in Asia.<\/p><p>  Consider the key highlights for the different divisions within BIM.  The fisheries development division deals exclusively with the fishing fleet, both offshore and inshore, in our various ports.  I will first deal with the financial elements and then refer to specific projects.  Overall, we invested approximately &euro;636,000 in fisheries grants in 2011 in areas such as safety, which is very important given the announcement this week.  With recent tragedies, we cannot have enough invested in safety and safety awareness.  We upgraded 87 vessels during 2011 for safety purposes.  We also helped fishermen to invest in their fishing vessels.  In 50 cases, this was to enhance on-board quality.  It is critical that we get young blood into the sector.  Two young fishermen received grants from us of &euro;50,000 each in 2011.<\/p><p>  We had smaller scale investments in lobster V-notching.  Over 200 vessels benefited from lobster V-notching.  With regard to seafood environmental management systems, over 230 vessel owners received financial assistance from BIM to enable them to bring their vessels and catches up to a certain standard to allow them to label catches as caught in an environmentally friendly manner and sustainable.<\/p><p>  With regard to some of the key projects we are involved in from a fisheries perspective, members will have heard over the past 12 months, in particular, about the drive at European level, including by the Council of Ministers, to reduce the amount of discards from EU fishing fleets.  The impact on the Irish fleet is particularly important to us.  We have been involved with various measures on discarding to try to work with the industry to try to identify fishing gear that will catch fish more selectively and, in particular, avoid certain species or reduce the number of juveniles being caught in our nets.<\/p> <p>Two of those involved a cod recovery programme and what is called a Seltra sorting box.  On one side of the hold there are adult fish, while on the other side there are juvenile discarded fish.  That is the extent of the problem in some of our fisheries.  We are trying to work with fishermen to introduce grids like this into their fishing nets to determine if they are more suitable from a selectivity perspective, so that the non-critical catch escapes and the commercial catch is retained.  <\/p><p> In the image one can see the juvenile fish swimming out through those square meshes.  That type of selective gear is essential for the protection of fish stocks and the long-term security of this industry.  <\/p><p> BIM is involved in a large number of other areas, including the tagging of albacore tuna, which is a valuable fishery.  Our fleet is currently chasing tuna 400 miles south of Ireland, nearly as far down as the Azores.  Some of the technology those vessels are deploying was developed in partnership with BIM.  We are also involved in key projects such as avoiding cetacean by-catch.<\/p><p> In addition, what does a fishing vessel which is 100 miles offshore do with its waste?  How can we ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account from a waste management perspective?  We have been involved with the industry specifically on projects that will see them baling and recycling the waste netting they might come across. <\/p><p> Aquaculture is another key area for BIM.  In 2011, we invested &euro;654,000 in aquaculture projects.  That includes a commercial aquaculture scheme which comprised &euro;104,000 for four recipients.  There were also 25 recipients in an aquaculture development programme. <\/p><p> BIM is also involved in the development of appropriate assessments, which are essential for Ireland to comply with the EU birds and habitats directives and Natura 2000.  A lot of staffing work has gone into that area.<\/p><p> In 2011, we made a lot of progress with seaweed.  It is new and different and we think it has considerable potential for the Irish sector.  Almost 1 million tonnes of seaweed are grown in China every year.  In 2011, we developed Ireland's first commercial seaweed farm off the Kerry coast in Dingle Bay.  That is now harvesting commercial quantities of seaweed which is sold both here and on international markets.  The images give examples of some of the trials BIM staff have done to enable this company to develop its own commercial operation.  <\/p><p> Members of the joint committee may have heard that BIM is involved in a new salmon farm off the Galway coast in the lee of the Aran Islands.  We term it a new approach because we have been working with scientists at the Marine Institute to investigate suitable locations.  Having gone through a number of locations, we think we have found a very good one off the Galway coast.<\/p><p> We received work packages from the Marine Institute in the following areas: farmed salmon and wild salmonid interactions, including sea lice and escape issues; hydrography and oceanography, including modelling of waste products, dispersal of any medicines used on the farm, and modelling of other possible environmental impacts; information characterising the marine environment at the proposed locations, including wave climate predictions, the fate of all and any emissions from the proposed farm, and the nature of the water column; and ornithology, both in the vicinity of the proposed farm and in the protected areas in and around the farm.  We got all that scientific information from the Marine Institute, which led us to believe that we have a viable site off the Galway coast.  Following receipt of the information, we proceeded to apply for a production licence.  That was the first time that a State agency like BIM has applied for such a licence.  If we are successful in obtaining a licence it is our intention to seek a suitable commercial investor to operate in that location.  We also have plans to move to a site in Mayo and, in due course, a site in Donegal.  The screen image shows the site in the Galway area.  <\/p><p> From a business development perspective, BIM is involved in helping our processing sector to add value to the catches being landed.  We also want to help it to invest in the capital costs of increasing capacity and expertise within its plants.  In recent years, BIM has been successful in creating additional jobs in the processing sector.  The figures are included in the presentation. <\/p><p> We have also had success in working on programmes like Lean SeaPro manufacturing and Green Seafood to ensure that there is full environmental compliance throughout the value chain - not just from the fishing vessel but all the way through to the catching and processing sectors.  There is a requirement from a market perspective - particularly concerning the multiples - for that level of traceability. <\/p><p> BIM also works with the processing sector to attain BRC or HACCP accreditation so that the top level of standards are attained by the processing sector.  That enables us to compete in the highest possible value markets.  Targeting markets that offer the highest price premiums must be the future for Irish seafood.  Those big niche markets - that is not a contradiction - are the future for Irish seafood, rather than competing at a commodity level.<\/p><p> BIM also offers a comprehensive service to the Irish retail sector which is offering fish, whether they be multiples or independent retailers.  We work with them on cold-chain management, labelling, branding and customer service.  That includes everything from their displays to their pricing.  BIM staff work with these companies to try to make fish more attractive and available to consumers.  The overall value of the domestic sector might have fallen in the last 12 months but, in fact, the amount of fish has increased.  That is particularly so for the more valued species such as hake.  BIM works on a value-added scheme which is specifically aimed at taking existing commodity players and transforming them into companies that add more value and make more efforts to address what modern consumers want, as opposed to just exporting on the hoof.  That is more easily done in some cases than others, such as pelagic fish.  We accept that the latter is more of a commodity trade.<\/p><p> BIM is also working with UCC to develop a graduate programme.  We now have young graduates coming into the sector every year who are trained in BIM for six to nine months.  They are then placed out in the industry to engender new blood, new thinking and enthusiasm into a sector that has real potential.  The appetite among graduates for these jobs is enormous.  The sector is seen as a new growth area, which is an important image for BIM to project.<\/p><p> Boarfish constitute a new business development project.  BIM discovered this fish species with our scientists in the Marine Institute.  Over the last two years, a quota has been set and Ireland's quota is approximately 56,000 tonnes.  BIM believes that there is a real future for boarfish, even though it is currently being sold exclusively for fishmeal.  It is only approximately the size of the palm of one's hand.  We have the majority of the total allowable catch, or TAC, in Ireland.  BIM believes there is major potential to take this fish - approximately all 56,000 tonnes of it - and develop a new high-value species that will be attractive to international markets and Asian markets in particular.  Even though it is a pelagic fish, like herring and mackerel, its flesh is similar to cod and whiting.  There is a major opportunity for us in that regard.<\/p> <p>In 2011, we were in Qingdao, China, with the different product formats developed in our seafood development centre, trying to attract international interest.  I am certain that over the next two years we will see a considerable amount of that fish going into the human value chain, which will be an enormous boost for the processing sector.  We did the same with blue whiting.  Historically, it was never eaten, but by 2012, 80,000 tonnes of that fish were landed in Killybegs for human consumption.  We believe the same transformation is possible with boarfish.<\/p><p> Our seafood development centre, based in Clonakilty, Cork, is the only dedicated seafood centre in Ireland and one of the few in Europe.  In 2011, approximately 300 companies went through the centre, resulting in 20 new product launches.  It has incubation space to encourage companies, whether large or small, to avail of our technologists, business development expertise and facilities.  This has proved to be very successful.<\/p><p> Training is a critical area that is often overlooked in every sector.  It is important in the seafood sector because of changing technologies and the dangers associated with fishing as a profession.  We have two excellent training facilities in our national colleges in Greencastle, County Donegal and Castletownbere, County Cork.  In addition, we have coastal training units which take the training to communities as opposed to communities having to go to the colleges.  During 2011, those units, similar to mobile cinemas, visited 29 different locations.  There is a significant uptake from the industry.  With the recent announcement in Union Hall, County Cork, by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, we expect a further increase in throughput in these coastal units, as well as at the national colleges.  Since 1999, 8,000 students have gone through the school at Castletownbere.  Obviously, some of them are repeat students upskilling but the figure is still significant.  There will be a big focus on training in 2013.<\/p><p> During 2011, we trained 1,250 individuals.  Areas covered include fisheries and aquaculture training, seafood safety training, safety training as well as workshops and different career events around specific areas such as fire fighting and vessel stability.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members for their attention and welcome any questions they might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373543400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Whooley and the other officials from Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  I recently had the opportunity to visit the seafood development centre in Clonakilty.  It is a wonderful facility with excellent work being done there.  I commend all the BIM staff for their excellent work.<\/p><p>  Clearly BIM is not resting on its laurels and examines new sectors in the fishing industry which could be potentially developed.  I know BIM has nothing to do with quotas.  However, I have always been of the view that we need to examine added-value processing.  The work done by BIM in this regard is encouraging.  What is the position of the boarfish project?  The blue whiting project has been very successful in Killybegs.  There may be other fish species that could be used for human or animal consumption.  Some of the processing plants are examining new technologies for dealing with boarfish.  Will the delegation give us an update on this and quota allocations for this area?<\/p><p>  The development of aquaculture and added-value processing is an integral part of Food Harvest 2020.  Is it an industry-led bottom-up approach demand for added-value processing or is it being driven by BIM?  If it is a case of the former, are the resources available to meet the potential demand?<\/p><p>  I know plans are at an advanced state for salmon farming in Galway Bay.  What is the status of it?  What is the view on the theories being put forward by objectors about sea lice?  How does one balance the creation of jobs and meeting the Food Harvest 2020 targets with the environmental concerns of locals in Galway?<\/p><p>  The recent announcement by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, on vessel grants has to be welcomed as a significant step in the right direction.  Unfortunately, it took a tragedy for it to occur but the grant-aid is still to be welcomed.  Will it be rolled out through BIM?  If so, will BIM advise us on this?<\/p><p>  I have spoken to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on seaweed harvesting and the Arramara plant in Galway.  It is my understanding that 70,000 tonnes of seaweed would be harvested from Connemara to north Donegal.  Can the delegation give us an idea of the potential tonnage?  There seems to be a huge demand from China for Irish seaweed.  Three products can be got from seaweed: the dried seaweed itself - which is exported, predominantly to China - and derivatives for use in facial products and food.  We want to go more towards developing the food side because one gets more bang for one&rsquo;s buck from this sector.  I have met with companies that are interested in exploiting the seaweed resource and exporting the seaweed whole packed to China.  What impact will that have on seaweed levels along the coast?  Some of the companies working in this area already are concerned it might be over-exploited.  Are there any controls in place?  Do they need to be put in place?  Should the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the Marine Institute and BIM come up with guidelines to ensure the seaweed natural resource is not exploited cheaply for price and exported and that we do not lose out on the added-value end of things?<\/p> <p>I am not sure if Mr. Whooley has any views on that, but controls need to be brought into that sector because if that does not occur, one could end up with a hugely valuable natural resource with many benefits being exploited for financial gain and the benefits being obtained by other jurisdictions outside our control.  I thank the delegation for coming here.  I am a great supporter of BIM and the work it does.  This country and the fishing industry is better off because of the work BIM does.  It is always nice to meet with its representatives and we wish them well in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100005#G00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373544000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Whooley for his presentation and welcome his team here.  In his presentation, he mentioned the reduction in staff.  I think he said BIM is down to 125 people.  How has that affected the roll-out of its project across the State?  Could he give us an indication of the overall budget BIM has to work with?  Has there been a reduction in the overall budget?<\/p><p>  I am looking at the macro-economic background.  Mr. Whooley says exports have increased by 13%.  He gave a number of figures relating to the current market focus, including a figure of 67% for Europe.  I am interested in this figure.  Are there any specific areas in Europe where there is a greater emphasis or demand from?  <\/p><p>  I met with a co-operative society very recently.  The produce in question was Tralee Bay oysters.  It was a critical meeting attended by BIM representatives.  Very unfairly, some of the people present were very antagonistic towards BIM or its representatives there and focused on issues that differed completely from the subject matter of the meeting.  In respect of people involved in inshore fishing, be it lobster, crayfish, oysters or inshore trawling, the peak season is from the end of June to September.  One might get &euro;23 to &euro;24 per kilo for lobsters earlier in the year and from September onwards, one will get something similar, which is a good price.  This would be replicated all along the coast.  It is mind-boggling in the sense that the overall costs have increased and continue to increase, be they diesel, insurance, maintenance or safety.  I know people who could be hauling 600 pots and crew members possibly earning &euro;55 or &euro;60 a day for that.  To be honest, it is slavery.  It would make sense if one had an integrated approach that would, hopefully, be driven by BIM where one could store one's produce so one would have a good income and develop new markets outside the usual ones.  What kind of work has BIM done on that and what type of budget does it have for it?  Let us take the example of someone with 80,000, 90,000 or 100,000 lobsters over a ten-day period during the height of the season.  Their market value, at &euro;8 or &euro;9 per kilo, is three times less than they get during the off-peak season, which is &euro;24 per kilo.  There is huge potential there.<\/p><p>  Another aspect is a brand market.  People are landing fish in their respective areas and the fish is entering the market but there is no local brand.  Is any work being done in producing or encouraging a local brand market?  For example, we have Galway Bay or Tralee Bay oysters.  <\/p><p>  Another issue that came up at that meeting was the cost of gaining entry to more lucrative markets, although they complained about the distance and travel costs relating to getting products to market, including the cost of air transport.  If little things like that could be addressed and there was a sizeable or even a marginal increase in the price one gets for produce, it would make a difference with regard to sustainability.  Mr. Whooley mentioned sustainability in his presentation.  He said 11,000 people were employed in the sector, which in macro terms is not huge, but it is huge income for coastal communities which are completely dependent on it.  It has also helped to sustain local coastal communities so they can continue to survive.<\/p><p>  Mr. Whooley mentioned the safety aspect, which I welcome in light of the tragic loss of the Bolger brothers recently.  As a result of a presentation given by the IFO, attended by Caitlin Ni Aodha, whose husband was lost at sea, I have been arguing for a type of beacon or personal locator device.  Would it not make sense if that was made mandatory and fully grant aided?  Many people fishing at the moment, particularly onshore fisherman, are only getting by day by day and are cutting corners.  When I looked at the boat on which those three brothers were lost, the size of the boat was the first issue while the second issue was the freeboard over the water line.  It was absolute suicide.  Not a foot and a half of that boat was over the water with three men on it plus pots.  They had lifejackets and were not detected and apparently, as I am only going by reports, they died of exposure.  If they had that type of beacon or personal locator, they would still be alive.  There is an onus on the Government and by extension, Government agencies to make safety measures like that mandatory and fully grant aid them.  I would like to hear Mr. Whooley's comments on that.<\/p><p>  In respect of discards and the time factor regarding the discard directive, I welcome the fact that BIM are out of the blocks on it, particularly when one is talking about  juvenile fishing.  All of that has been staring us in the face for a considerable period of time.  This must be driven politically to make sure that becomes the reality.  I would appreciate a comment from Mr. Whooley on that.  <\/p><p>  I do not think anybody from a coastal or west of Ireland community has not heard some lobby regarding the BIM Galway project on salmon farming.  Could Mr. Whooley give us an update on it?  How advanced or serious has the conversation with the communities that will be on the front line been?  What kind of conversation and dialogue has taken place, particularly with people who have been involved in the industry, albeit with no drift netting?  What are the expectations or hopes that drift netting will again become part of an income?  When the legislation banning drift netting was introduced, I argued that it would have a huge impact on other sectors, which it has had, and take a nice portion of the livelihood of people in coastal communities.  Deputy Harrington's community and my own would know about it quite well.  It has done irreparable damage to the sustainability of incomes for people from those areas.<\/p> <p> I thank BIM for its presentation.  Now, more than ever, we need that integration between BIM and coastal communities, not only the four or five the witnesses mentioned but such communities as Doonbeg in Clare, Fenit, and up along the coast from Rossaveal north into Achill.  That connection needs to be there.  There are areas where improvements can happen, whether through marketing, added value or whatever, that can make that difference of sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100006#H00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373544600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Mr. Whooley spoke about the new approach to the farmed salmon project and the identification of the location.  Are there other potential locations or is BIM fixing on that one to see how it works?  Is it a pilot scheme, or how does BIM describe it?

What are the rules and regulations surrounding that investor?  Is it a Europe-wide investor or an Irish investor, or does it matter?  Mr. Whooley spoke about the future being niche as opposed to commodity.  Could he expand on that?  We know what it means, but what does it actually mean here?  Does Mr. Whooley believe the fishing industry will change its profile in the next five to ten years?  I understand what it means in English but I do not know what he means by it.  Those are expressions we very often throw around but I am asking him to pinpoint that.<\/p><p>  On BIM's relationship with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, I have a case on my desk of somebody applying for a foreshore licence to harvest seaweed.  The notification letter went in to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government six months ago and there has been no reply, despite constant requests for a response, whatever that might be.  When BIM makes a presentation it tells us about the good things, and that is as it should be, in a way.  Reality is often different.  BIM does not want to come in here and give us a list of all the issues causing problems but sometimes we need a reality check.  That is the kind of reality check we get.  People are out there trying to do what BIM wants them to do, recognising a market.  This person is waiting to go ahead and there has been no response from the Department.  BIM is not the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but the application was submitted from its offices and has been sitting somewhere for six months.  I would like a response to that.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could take it up with me.  I am not putting the person's details on the record here.  I am sure he or she is not the only one.

I welcome Mr. Whooley and his team.  For anybody in a coastal community and who has an interest in sea fisheries, this is an exciting time and there is much change.  There is not a townland in this country that is more than 60 miles from the sea.  For an island nation, a maritime country, sea fisheries is one of the least understood industries in this country and that is reflected in debates in this House.  It is the Cinderella of our natural resources and that is regrettable because it has the greatest potential for economic activity in areas where it is difficult to attract economic activity as we understand it.  That is why BIM and its presentation of its annual report is so critical.  It speaks for the future of the industry as BIM sees it.<\/p><p>  BIM is one of the few organisations that genuinely speaks for the industry.  We have seen this in the sub-committee the Chairman has established to examine inshore fisheries.  Who speaks for the fishing industry in Ireland?  We have seen how many different organisations suddenly spring up.  Based on geography, in a country such as Ireland the number of producer organisations does not make sense.  Mr. Whooley is familiar with this.  The producer organisations should be based on the industry segments.  For example, there should be separate producer organisations for pelagic, demersal, aquaculture, inshore and shellfish.  We are too small to have geographically based producer organisations that compete for membership when they should come forward with a strategic vision for how they see their segment of the industry.  People do not understand that the pelagic segment is as different to the demersal as poultry is to tillage in the agriculture industry.<\/p><p>  When one makes comparisons, people always ask why the fishing industry is not like the farming industry, which lobbies with one voice.  The fishermen are competing against each other for a common resource.  There are no boundaries, title documents, gates or areas where one can or cannot go.  It is highly competitive, technical and very difficult.  In that context I very much welcome BIM's enthusiasm to champion, add value to and progress what it sees as the future of fishing in this country.<\/p><p>  I particularly welcome the recent announcements on safety.  That is completely underestimated.  There is nobody in a coastal area who does not know somebody affected.  A family member of mine was lost at sea and was never recovered, albeit in a different generation.  We must start embracing the technology available.  BIM will take that so far.  The grant aid it has announced will be welcome.  I do not fully agree with the idea that one should 100% grant-aid anything.  There is 60% grant aid for small vessels and 40% grant aid for larger vessels.  We should give the industry the buy-in.  It is a very modest amount, a couple of hundred euro.  It is &euro;75 to get the personal flotation device and the personal locator beacon.  We should give the skippers the opportunity to buy into it.  We must change the mindset.  If 50% of fishermen are going to comply, we must see 100%.  When the seatbelt legislation came in people said they would not wear them, but it has happened, by and large.  People wear seatbelts now and I expect the fishing industry will comply.  At least if we cannot save lives, we will recover people.  We must examine the Icelandic experience.  I have heard the Minister say in a country with a huge maritime fleet they have had only one loss of life in several years.  They have the training, the compliance, the attitude and the vessels.  They compete.  Income is not an issue.  Their compliance is laudable and we should attain that standard.<\/p><p>  Aquaculture offers major potential for job creation in coastal communities.<\/p> <p>I know of small rural areas where large multinational companies work offshore and members of 50 or 60 families have not emigrated because of a sustainable and clean aquaculture industry.  It is not without its critics or problems, but on balance it is a lifeline for coastal communities.  If the regulatory environment is robust, which I believe it is, there is no reason we cannot aspire to having an aquaculture industry equal to that in Scotland or Norway.  We are starting from a very low base and I see huge potential.  I entirely support the aspirations of BIM to bring economic activity to these areas in consultation with communities, which is very important.  A large aquaculture industry means a critical mass which provides not only offshore jobs but also onshore jobs in processing which is the real benefit of an aquaculture industry.  These may be seasonal, but it could be planned so the work needs to be done 12 months a year.  This would help supplement agricultural incomes in these areas, which are challenged, and would provide a lifeline for communities where too many people must leave to go to Australia, Canada and elsewhere.<\/p><p> I hate the idea of levies, but with regard to funding, has an industry-led levy been considered?  I accept it is such a fragmented industry it would be difficult to impose or manage such a levy.  BIM is a flag bearer for adding value to the industry and marketing it, and it aspires to achieve more for seafood, but funding is always an issue and meetings such as this are always helpful because the issue gets an airing.  It is also helpful that BIM's reports are published and bring the issue into the public eye.  Unfortunately the media do not pick up on maritime issues as much as I would like.<\/p><p> I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate and I wish BIM the very best.  I know it will not sit on its hands and will aspire to further technology and achievements and will have further consultation with the industry.  All of us could do more to promote this natural resource.  We do not need to look to the oil and gas industry for resources; we have a massive resource around our coast and it needs better co-ordination, promotion and information.  The people of the country do not appreciate what we have.  We are a tiny island off the west coast of the European Continent, which has its drawbacks, but most people who work along the coast do not see a barrier but a highway, a living and a resource, and this needs to be highlighted more and more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100007#J00300","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373545200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>BIM is exiting the ice plant business.

I will deal with the broader questions and the expert team to my left will answer questions according to subject.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked whether our development strategy was industry-led or top-down.  It is a mixture of both.  It is a traditional sector with a considerable range of expertise in various areas, and it is very important for an organisation such as ours to be out and about listening to people, hearing what they have to say, addressing their concerns and planning a way forward with the industry.  With this comes an obligation or onus on an organisation such as BIM, as a development agency with resources at our disposal, to lead the industry forward and provide leadership.  We take this role very seriously.  We investigate and scan the wider environment from a business perspective and, on the basis of the trends we see internationally and monitoring what the competition is doing, we plan with the industry and for the industry.  I would like to think this challenges both parties, with us being pulled by the industry in a certain direction and equally us trying to take the industry in a certain direction.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked about niche versus commodity.  Marketing language tends to get thrown around and it can be a bit glib from time to time.  Where we see niche versus commodity is down almost at species level.  We have a very successful scaled pelagic sector with herring, mackerel and such species being exported quite successfully to markets such as Egypt, Nigeria and Russia.  The costs are good, and in a commodity business when the costs are right and of significant scale a margin can be made and this is where we are trying to focus.  When we speak about niche it is with regard to the more traditional shellfish and whitefish species.  In 2011 the whitefish market in Europe amounted to 15 million tonnes, worth &euro;55 billion.  Of this &euro;55 billion, 62% was imported from outside Europe.  A total of 89% of whitefish consumed in Europe was imported from outside.  Species such as pangasius, tilapia and Nile perch are commodity species from low-cost countries which go to a market which, based on the figures, account for approximately 67% of our sales.  If we try to compete with these species, as we are doing at present, in the longer term we will lose because their costs are far lower than ours.  The differentiation we are speaking about is with regard to these species.  We must market species such as haddock, whiting and cod at a higher level or through different channels than where the other species are headed because it would be a race to the bottom if we tried to compete.  I hope this in some way explains the specifics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100008#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1373545200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>It is a challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100008#K00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373545200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Yes it is, but it is the specifics of what we discuss when we speak about niche markets.<\/p><p>  The reduction in staff has been very difficult.  Through early retirement and the loss of contract staff we lost top-class, highly qualified and highly experienced individuals and it has been a challenge for the organisation and for the management team to try to cope with this.  We have tried to reorganise and have merged divisions.  We have cut many of our costs and refocused or dropped services and taken on new ones with a view to addressing where the industry needs to go and also its demand for our services.<\/p> <p>It has been a challenge.  It continues to be a challenge but that is the nature of our economy now and public service management is at that juncture.  <\/p><p> The Chairman wanted to know the total allowable catch for boarfish.  The TAC is scientifically based.  On an annual basis, similar to every other species, it will be subjected to scientific assessment.  The TAC and our relative share of it will rise or fall according to the scientific advice.  He is right.  We do not want the species to be around for just 12 months or two years before disappearing.

I shall pass these questions, specifically those on salmon, to my colleague, Mr. Donal Maguire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100008#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373545800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to attend and the members for their queries.  The simplest thing to do is give an update on the Galway Bay salmon project and then I shall deal with the other issues.<\/p><p>  As the committee will be aware from previous contributions, there has been an attempt to kick-start the upscaling of production from the organic certified Irish farmed salmon sector.  As required under Food Harvest 2020, BIM has worked closely with its colleagues in the Marine Institute and brought forward a plan to locate and secure licences for various offshore locations.  In doing so, we have relied heavily on the institute's expertise because it has the leading scientists in this area.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Whooley mentioned in his presentation, we have used substantial work packages by the Marine Institute in our environmental impact study around the location.  The location in Galway Bay was the first and will probably be the largest and most ambitious application that we are likely to have, simply because it is the largest body of water and shows the greatest potential for a large scale salmon farm.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, we forwarded an application with an environmental impact study to the aquaculture foreshore management division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is the competent authority for licensing.  The application went to both statutory and public consultation and the processes finished in mid-December.<\/p><p>  We received a great number of submissions to which we have responded.  All of the responses have been lodged with the Department.  As an applicant, we must be careful how we treat the matter.  Our understanding of the process is that the Department will have circulated all of the documentation to the relevant State experts and, in turn, will receive various appraisals and reports.  We do not know whether we will have requests for further information or clarification or whether it will be deemed that the Department has sufficient information to make a recommendation to the Minister.  He can accept the application as submitted and grant the licence, perhaps with modifications and special conditions, or he can decline the application.  Whatever decision he makes is subject to appeal.  An independent body called the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board will, most likely, consider the application.  I say that because virtually every salmon farm licensing application made over the past 20 or 30 years has required the services of the board.  That would kick in if, 30 days after the Minister makes his decision and publishes it, a member of the public or an organisation wished to lodge an appeal.  The Department is still considering the application and taking advice from various State experts and bodies and we await the outcome.  As the applicant we do not know how long the process will take and will have to wait and see what happens.  <\/p><p>  We have had quite a number of very serious expressions of interest from investors in the event that we obtain a licence.  All of the major global salmon farming players, together with a number of other consortiums, have expressed serious interest in being BIM tenants if and when a licence is granted.  We are pretty confident that the commercial development will become a reality if and when we succeed in achieving the required licence.  <\/p><p>  With regard to locations, we are investigating locations on the River Lee and near Inishturk and Inishbofin off the Mayo coast.  We are at the point where we are receiving further data packs from our colleagues in the Marine Institute and will be able to determine whether there are viable and suitable salmon farming sites in those locations.  We do not know, as yet, whether the locations will be suitable.  Obviously we will only submit an application if and when they do.  We will be cautious and careful in that regard.  I can say that even if there are suitable sites they will be smaller and not on the scale of Galway Bay.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris expressed concern about communities.  BIM has worked hard to meet everybody who has an interest or a query on the Galway Bay project and the subsequent projects.  We have spent many evenings on the islands and have talked to island communities and the inshore fishing community all around Galway Bay.  For our sins, we have also attended a number of meetings with angling interests that have been less friendly and civilised than the meetings that we have had elsewhere, but that is their position and point of view.  <\/p><p>  BIM will continue to work hard at trying to reassure people and put forward our position on the project.  Based on the work packages given to us by the Marine Institute, the science tells us that the project can be brought forward without a significant environmental impact and would not displace employment in other sectors.  We are confident that will be the case.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to build the project over time.  It would not instantly go into full production.  There would be an opportunity to see how it developed and whether there were issues or problems as it went along.  I hope that I have dealt with most of the questions about salmon farms.  Let me know if I have forgotten anything.  <\/p><p>  A number of questions were asked about seaweed.  First, I shall distinguish between seaweed aquaculture, which is the growing of seaweed, and seaweed harvesting or gathering.  There is a long-established tradition of seaweed gathering along the west coast that is largely based around the species Ascophyllum nodosum.  That is the species that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has had a long-standing engagement with that species of seaweed.  It tends to be dried, processed and used in nutraceuticals and animal feeds and in supplements for golf course greens, racehorses, and so on.<\/p><p>  A new industry around Laminaria or kelp was also mentioned, which is probably what the Senator was talking about.  I believe a licence for harvesting it in the Bantry area is about to be granted.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have reservations about kelp harvesting in other locations.  We should wait and see how the project goes.<\/p><p>  Kelp grows lower down the shore and tends to be underwater all the time, so it is a different type of gathering than the intertidal gathering that is practised for Ascophyllum nodosum.  BIM is most excited about, and most interested in, seaweed aquaculture, which is the project in Dingle that Mr. Whooley mentioned.<\/p> <p>This is where we are creating new seaweed rather than harvesting existing seaweed resources.  That is based around a species called Alaria esculenta.  We have worked very hard with the promoters and other academic institutions so that we can now reliably produce this seaweed.  It goes out on seeded ropes and long lines, quite similar to what members would be familiar with in the mussel industry.  It produces a single high-value species which can be used for human consumption or it can be used for nutraceuticals or for veterinary products.  It is a modest beginning but it is very exciting.  This will be a big new area of activity.<\/p><p> In terms of the relationship with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, perhaps we might talk to Senator O'Keeffe in the margins about that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100009#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373546400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Yes.

One could say they have been constant at around &euro;17 million.  Within that, the capital element has been pretty constant at &euro;4 million.  Our current element has also been pretty constant over that time.<\/p><p>  We have managed to remain within budget all of the time and we have managed our resources better and more efficiently with fewer people.  Greater reliance on technology has been a big help to us.  We have fewer people, with more work, rather than less, being done more efficiently.  We have been using automated approval systems and paperless systems.  We have worked very closely with our parent Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, sharing costs such as web hosting costs.  We have been creative and inventive and we have upskilled.  While self-praise is no praise, it is a great credit to the organisation that many people who were doing one job three or four years ago are now doing additional jobs.  In my department and in the other departments, everybody has metamorphosed and has accepted the reality of a reduction in the headcount.  As Mr. Whooley said, there has been quite a significant reduction in the headcount from 175 to 125.  There are programmes we have not been able to do but there are others which we have taken on.  We have used our skill and our productivity and efficiency are very good.  <\/p><p>  Budgets have been pretty constant.  In terms of workload, I do not think the industry has suffered.

I do not think it is anything new as people have been lost at sea since time immemorial.  However, when one sees tragedies that might otherwise be avoided, it requires a new approach.  What was announced on Monday was a new approach involving two key components - the first being a training-based one, which I must admit is so important, and training specifically in the use of modern equipment.  We will roll out the availability of a new lifejacket which will be fitted with a personal locator beacon.  The tragedy we saw in the past month in Waterford highlighted the fact that fishermen might be alive in the sea for a period of time but then finally succumb to hypothermia.  That new scheme is hugely important.<\/p><p>  Alongside it, there will be a task force to look at the wider area of maritime safety in the fishing sector, which will be chaired by Mr. John Leech of Irish Water Safety.  Deputy Martin Ferris hit the nail on the head in that one of the many things it will look at is stability.  Tragically, we see small potting boats going out to collect pots but then turning upside-down.  That type of tragedy can be avoided.  There are many other aspects of onboard safety at which that committee will look.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Coveney, wants a report by the end of the year.  It will then be up to the Department and ourselves to implement that report.<\/p><p>  There are, critically, two components.  There is grant aid for the lifejackets, locator beacons, the autopilot alarm, which will alert somebody that the wheelhouse may be unattended, and electronic position-indicating radio beacons, which are the locator beacons fitted to the vessel, particularly to the smaller boats.  If they were more widely used, some tragedies might be averted.  There will also be grant aid for smaller items like wireless cut-off cords for the engine so that if one falls overboard, the boat does not steam away and leave one behind.<\/p><p>  The grant aid will be at a new rate of 60% for the smaller vessels.  It will be 40% for most boats but 60% for vessels under 12 m which do not tow gear.  That is the maximum we are allowed to go under European legislation.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris raised the specific point of whether this equipment should be made mandatory.  There is a dilemma here.  If we make it mandatory, under existing European Union law, grant aid is no longer available.  One must remove the grant aid.  The strategy we have is, I suspect, a sensible one.  We will make attendance at the one-day enhanced safety training scheme every five years a mandatory obligation.  It will be &euro;75 to attend the one-day training course.  One will get a card, which will become mandatory.  When one attends that course, one will be given the option of paying an extra &euro;75 which will entitle one to the full safety equipment.  Immediately, attendance at the course and the card-carrying fisherman become the obligatory element.  When one next presents for certification with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, carriage of the lifejackets then becomes mandatory.  I hope that makes sense.  By not immediately introducing a mandatory component on the lifejackets and personal locator beacons, we can continue to give maximum grant aid.  We will phase in that process over the next three years.  I hope that clarifies that point.<\/p><p>  We have spent quite a lot of money over the years setting up lobster holding facilities.  I agree that if one looks at the price of lobster over the course of a year, in July and August, when the season is at its height and the lobsters are most frequent, the prices collapse.  If we could hold these animals and sell them at a more steady pace throughout the year, we would maximise the price.  We have had success as far north as Malin Head, where there is a wonderful lobster holding facility.  If there are specific projects that need to be brought to our attention, we have funds which can further help this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100010#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1373546400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>There is a new initiative, FLAG.

The European market is sluggish and we all know the reasons for that.  The Spanish market in particular is difficult.  Traditionally, the Spanish market was a very good market for Irish shellfish, lobsters, crab and prawns.  Now our strategy is to develop our Chinese market.  Last year, we assisted four big companies to create a joint venture to take their product into the Chinese market.  We created a joint venture because scale is essential because it is so costly to get into the market.  One of these companies was a producer of lobster and crab and we linked it up with a processor.  They and two others formed a joint venture hub, Ocean Jade.  This is an interesting development because it takes us to a brand new market, taking the pressure off the need for our Spanish market.  Spain will now have to lift prices to meet the cost of our product if it wants it.  In China there is a super-wealthy new middle class and there is a great appetite for Irish seafood.  This is the broad base of our strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071100011#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1373547000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We have received apologies from Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and Senator Terry Leyden.<\/p><p>  The first item on the agenda today is a discussion of the priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency.  On behalf of the committee I am delighted to welcome to our meeting today His Excellency Vidmantas Purlys, ambassador of Lithuania to Ireland.  I thank him for coming to talk about the programme and priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Lithuania took over the Presidency at the start of this month at the end of our Presidency.  Hosting the rotating Presidency is always demanding for member states, as we well know, particularly smaller ones.  This is Lithuania's first Presidency since it joined the European Union nine years ago.  It was our seventh Presidency.  We very much look forward to Lithuania's Presidency.  I have no doubt it will rise to the challenge.  I was fortunate to attend the first event for members, the COSAC chairpersons' meeting, which took place on Sunday and Monday of this week.  We had an excellent visit to the capital, Vilnius, and also to Trakai Castle.  We had a very good, informative and robust session with the Lithuanian Commissioner for Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration and the Vice President of the Commission, Maro&amp;#353; &amp;#352;ef&amp;#269;ovi&amp;#269;.  We discussed the priorities of the Presidency but also political and economic union.  It was a very useful event, which was very well chaired by the Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, Gediminas Kirkilas.  Most people went away refreshed and assured that the Presidency would be successful.<\/p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I advise Mr. Purlys that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to do so, he will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.<\/p> <p>He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> I invite His Excellency Mr. Purlys to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100003#B00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373549700,"counter":49,"content":"<p>It is a great pleasure and honour to address the committee and I thank the members very much for the invitation.  I will structure my presentation in three parts.  First, I will briefly introduce Lithuania as a member of the European Union and outline our approach to the Presidency.  Second, I will outline the context for the EU legislative process in the second half of 2013.  Third, I will inform the committee of the plans and priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency.<\/p><p>  I congratulate Ireland and the joint committee on an excellent Presidency.  We are very happy about co-operation with Ireland in preparation for the Presidency, as trio partners and bilaterally, among capitals and in Brussels.  Co-operation between Lithuania and Ireland is important to ensure continuity at EU level.<\/p><p>  This is our first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  We believe and feel we are well prepared to steer forward the EU agenda.  We have benefited greatly from the European Union and work hard to contribute to strengthening the Union's credibility, promoting growth, providing safety to the citizens and enhancing the international standing of the Union.  In Lithuania, there is broad public approval<b><\/b>of our membership of the Union, as well as political party support on the European policy priorities, which cut across the political spectrum.<\/p><p>  Lithuania developed successfully over the last 23 years since the restoration of independence in 1990 after 50 years of Soviet occupation.  The last two decades were years of radical structural reforms, economic growth and modernisation.  Although we experienced an economic downturn in 2009, we emerged strongly in 2010 and grew by over 3% in the last couple of years.  Today Lithuania is one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU.<\/p><p>  We believe it is important to engage closely with EU institutions and the member states since the EU legislative process is a collective exercise.  We will be counting on both our preparation and the engagement of all our EU and worldwide partners in moving the EU agenda forward across a broad range of sectors.  Lithuania will be a result-oriented and honest broker.<b><\/b>A busy and exciting period is ahead of us.  The Lithuanian Presidency is the first of a Union with 28 member states.  We are very glad to welcome Croatia as a member state.  The Lithuanian Presidency will mark the peak of the legislative activity in the current cycle, with European Parliament elections coming in May 2014.  We will, therefore, have to deal with an agenda that is much busier than usual.<\/p><p>  The Lithuanian Presidency comes last in the current EU budgetary cycle, meaning that decisions will have to be taken to give effect to the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020 and EU budget 2014.  To have budgets adopted and money flowing in to concrete programmes is critical to the member states and EU citizens, especially in the current economic climate.  This requires significant concerted efforts by the EU institutions.  The MFF-related legislative package comprises 75 pieces of legislation.  Fifty-nine of these files have to be closed by 1 January 2014.  We should work hard to ensure the timely adoption of an EU budget for 2014.<\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency has done a great job.  Lithuania will continue on the same track, focusing on three main areas.  We will work for a credible, growing and open Europe.  The European Union's economic credibility is built on our ability to ensure financial stability and sound public finances.  To this end, we must implement an enhanced framework for economic governance, deepen economic and monetary union, develop the banking union and protect the financial interests of the Union and its member states.<\/p><p>  The banking union<b><\/b>will<b><\/b>be a top priority for us.  We will focus on reaching final agreement with the European Parliament on a bank recovery and resolution directive and on deposit guarantee schemes.  The Commission's proposal on the single resolution mechanism was announced yesterday.  On this file, we would like to make as much progress as possible with a view to completing this dossier by the end of the parliamentary term.<\/p><p>  Financial market reform is also important.  We hope it will be possible to reach agreement with the Parliament on the directive and regulation of markets in financial instruments, the Omnibus II directive, the market abuse regulation and the regulation on central securities depositories.<\/p><p>  The framework for economic governance will be effective only when properly implemented.  Therefore, before considering new elements, we need to ensure that the potential of initiatives such as the European semester, Stability and Growth Pact, six-pack and two-pack is fully realised.  We await Commission proposals on <i>ex ante <\/i>co-ordination and the convergence and competitiveness instrument, and will take discussion of these issues forward in accordance with the decisions by the June 2013 European Council.<\/p><p>  On credibility, we are determined to strengthen the Union's efforts in the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion so as to protect the financial interests of the Union and its member states.  We will seek agreement on a revised savings taxation directive and seek progress on some other legislation in this area.<\/p><p>  Stability in financial markets will help restore confidence.  However, more needs to be done to secure sustainable economic growth.  Therefore, the second priority of the Lithuanian Presidency will be a focus on growing Europe.  We need growth that results in real jobs for the people of Europe.  We need growth that enhances European competitiveness.  To this end, we will redouble our efforts on the Europe 2020 strategy and on effective implementation of the compact for growth and jobs.  We will ensure that the next European semester cycle gets under way in good order.  We expect the annual growth survey to be presented by the European Commission in November and we will steer discussion in the Council on this issue.<\/p><p>  Growing Europe also means going further to complete the Single Market.  As holders of the Presidency, we are keen both to complete the Single Market I package - with particular emphasis on the implementation of the services directive - and make good progress on the Single Market II initiatives, notably on product safety and market surveillance regulations, electronic invoicing in public procurement and reducing the cost of deploying broadband communications.<\/p><p>  Specifically, on the digital single market, our aim is to establish a clear link between the digital agenda, integration of the services markets, and a SME-friendly regulatory environment.  Cutting the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>cost of communications is critical for business, especially SMEs, so we need to reach agreement on trans-European telecommunications guidelines and e-identification.  The digital market will not be effective without proper cyber-security so we will be considering also this particular issue.<\/p><p>  The Presidency will seek to ensure that the implementation of smart regulation initiatives promote favourable environment for business, in particular SMEs.<\/p><p>  The next priority is the internal energy market.  The 2014 deadline for its completion is rapidly approaching.  We will focus on implementation of the third energy package and the list of projects of common interests.  The completion of the energy market in Europe will allow the main costs for companies and economies more affordable and make our own economies more competitive.  We in Lithuania are very well known as being cut off from the rest of the Union and we know what it means not to be integrated into the internal energy market.  In this regard, Europe needs to speak with one voice on external energy relations and our interaction with the major energy suppliers.<\/p><p>  We firmly believe that progress on all these files will create employment opportunities, for young people in particular.  We will put special emphasis on implementing the youth guarantee and youth employment initiative.  We will initiate discussion and seek the adoption of the Council declaration on the European Alliance for Apprenticeships.<\/p><p>  Research and innovation also drive growth and competitiveness.  We want to develop a genuine single market for knowledge, research and innovation.  Policy debate on a European research area will play an important part at the October European Council meeting.<\/p> <p>The EU's regional market strategies also contribute to growth, so our Presidency will review progress in the strategies for the Baltic Sea and the new regions.  <\/p><p> The last priority of the Lithuanian Presidency will be to strengthen the EU as a global model of openness and security.  Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013 - the first day of our Presidency - but that does not make the enlargement portfolio any thinner.  Current EU negotiations with Montenegro and Turkey will be further advanced, as will the European perspective of other western Balkan countries, including the start of EU accession negotiations with Serbia, as decided by the European Council. <\/p><p> Naturally, we place importance on the advancement of the EU's eastern partnership.  November's eastern partnership summit in Vilnius should be an opportunity to sign an association agreement, including a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement with the Ukraine.  Similar agreements with Moldova, Georgia and Armenia should also be initialled.  We might also be able to look at advancing the process of visa liberalisation and facilitation for some eastern partnership countries.<\/p><p> Free trade agreements have the potential to foster economic growth and bring jobs to Europe.  The Presidency will aim to accelerate talks on free trade agreements not only with the eastern partners but also with the Mediterranean countries and, most importantly, strategic partners like the US and Japan.  That is also important to Lithuania nationally.  Lithuania's exports make up 80% of our GDP.  We have a small and open economy, so free trade is significant in our case.<\/p><p> Aiming at the effective control of European borders, Lithuania will seek to make progress in the Council on the so-called smart borders package.  Other elements of an open Europe include development, continuing preparations for the UN General Assembly, and preparing Council conclusions on financing for development, as well as integrating the transition experience of member states in the EU's development co-operation.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Lithuania will devote particular attention to the parliamentary dimension of EU co-operation.  Nine major parliamentary forums will be held in Vilnius, including three interparliamentary conferences and six meetings of the chairpersons of parliamentary committees.  The Chairman and his colleagues are very welcome to visit Vilnius.  I hope the Chairman enjoyed his previous stay there and had a productive discussion.<\/p><p> Parliamentary co-operation is of particular significance during the European Year of Citizens, which will conclude by holding a major civil society forum in Vilnius in December. <\/p><p> I thank members of the joint committee for their attention and look forward to their comments or questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100004#C00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

My first question might be off the topic of the Lithuanian Presidency.  What action will the Lithuanian Government take concerning some of Lithuania's prisons?  I raise this issue because in two recent court cases - one in Dublin and one in Belfast - the judges refused to extradite individuals who faced possible imprisonment in Lithuania.  This was because of the conditions there, including overcrowding.  The European Committee on the Prevention of Torture and the European Court of Human Rights have conducted research on prisons in Lithuania and have stated that the conditions in one particular prison remain inhumane and degrading.  Given that Lithuania currently holds the Presidency, what will the Lithuanian Government be doing to improve prison conditions, including some prisoners' human rights and the visiting conditions which for some people may be conducted in a harsh environment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100005#D00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550300,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the ambassador has updated the committee on the priorities for Lithuania's Presidency.  I wish to concentrate on the issue of a banking union and the banking recovery and resolution agenda.  The ambassador will be aware from a programme country perspective that we have been encouraged by the decision taken in June 2012 on the notion of breaking the link between the sovereign and bailing out banks.  Clearly, however, a significant amount of work has to be done to resolve various issues before that comes to pass.  I would like to get an idea from the ambassador about what timeframe is involved in getting to a point where the necessary architecture will be in place, so that once and for all we can say that the link between weak sovereign and weak banks is broken.  To that extent, the burden will no longer be required to be borne by taxpayers in a potential bailout situation.<\/p><p>  As regards strengthening the 2020 growth strategy, we all recognise that while much of our discussions during the Irish Presidency were about trying to resolve the financial crisis that has developed across Europe and elsewhere in recent years, we will hopefully at some point reach the end of that.  It will only happen, however, when there are sustainable levels of growth.  Has the Lithuanian Presidency set any growth targets it hopes to achieve across Europe by the end of the year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100005#D00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550300,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I would like to extend a warm welcome to ambassador Purlys, whom I have met on previous occasions.  I applaud him and his embassy staff for liaising with the Lithuanian expatriate community in Ireland.  Officially that community is around 37,000 but may be as high as 50,000.  I congratulate the embassy for maintaining that cultural link with the Lithuanian diaspora here.  They are very welcome.  They bring a lot of cultural diversity to Ireland, which is more than welcome.<\/p><p>  This is an exciting time for Lithuania.  We have so much in common and have comparable populations.  Lithuania has suffered a lot from the same difficulties that we do, including emigration.  I hope the ambassador will find the liaison with the Irish Presidency's officials to be beneficial, given that Lithuania is now holding the Presidency for the first time.  It is a major, challenging task but I am sure Lithuania is quite capable of coming to terms with it.  During the Irish Presidency I was amazed at the amount of activity that parliamentarians, including Ministers, and civil servants had to undertake in hosting such an important event.  I wish Lithuania well in carrying out this task.<\/p><p>  Lithuania is situated in a very important region and is closely involved through the Nordic-Baltic co-operation agreements with its neighbours, including Estonia and Latvia.  I am curious to know how Lithuania will handle the developing relationships with the former adversaries, the Russians who border on Lithuania.  We are aware of tensions with Russia and earlier in the week we read about the Magnitsky case.  The Lithuanian President has been involved in answering questions about that matter.  The gentleman who came here, Mr. Browder, has been sentenced to nine years in prison <i>in absentia <\/i>by the Russian authorities.  We know how sensitive the Russians are about such issues, but it is obviously more sensitive for Lithuania and its immediate neighbours in the Baltic states in terms of how it can develop relationships with Russia.<\/p><p>  I wish Lithuania well in holding the current Presidency.  How does Ambassador Purlys see the evolution of relationships between Russia and Lithuania in the coming six months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100005#D00500","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373550900,"counter":55,"content":"<p>With regard to the prison situation, Lithuania is party to all major European conventions and organisations such as the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the European Union, as well as the United Nations.  We comply with all the human rights frameworks that are in place that govern prison conditions.  These are improving and will continue to improve.  I am not an expert on prison conditions but I assure the committee it is developing in a positive direction.  I hope this is shared all by other European partners and all prison conditions are getting better.<\/p><p>  The further development of a European banking union is an important priority for the Lithuanian Presidency.  There are several directives and regulations that need to be adopted to give effect to the banking union.  Two of them were agreed under the Irish Presidency and will have to be negotiated with the European Parliament.  We will take a hands-on approach to these discussions with the European Parliament with a view to wrapping up these conditions by the end of the year.  The recent announcement by the Commission of the single resolution mechanism directive is a further building block for banking union.  We hope to have this directive adopted by the end of the parliamentary term of the current European Parliament.  The breaking of the link between sovereign and banking debt will be discussed while these regulations are debated.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the EU 2020 strategy is in full gear.  I do not believe new targets will be established for the remainder of this year.  Lithuanian will vigorously push the EU 2020 agenda as agreed by the relevant Council conclusions and EU documents.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee members for their kind words with regard to the diaspora and the Lithuanian community here in Ireland.  Liaising with our nationals is a significant part of our embassy&rsquo;s work.  I thank the committee members for their good words on our co-operation and that it will develop positively.  I fully agree co-operation between Lithuania and Ireland is very close.  There is a good deal of co-operation between the two countries&rsquo; officials, parliamentarians and Ministers at EU and OSCE levels.  The Lithuanian Presidency will open new windows for engagement with Irish officials and Ministers.  The Lithuanian community in Ireland is the strong human bond that connects the two countries.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Magnitsky case, it will depend on the discussion between EU member states as to how the response will develop.  The Lithuanian Presidency will not take its own initiatives in this regard and will listen carefully to what our partners have to say on this particular issue.<\/p><p>  As regards relations with Russia, it is a strategic partner of the EU.  There is the partnership for modernisation and the post-partnership co-operation agreement with Russia.  There are trade relations with Russia which are important to many EU countries.  There is also a human rights dialogue.  These are all important building blocks in our relationship with Russia.  By and large, we have constructive and pragmatic relations with our Russian partners in a variety of areas including trade and economy.<\/p><p>  In the area of energy, there are several actions the EU can take to balance the relationship with Russia&rsquo;s major suppliers.  The completion of the Internal Market with good energy infrastructure links will be very beneficial to all of our economies.  It can assist in providing alternative sources of energy, reducing prices and boosting our competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100006#E00100","nonspeaker":"H.E.

How important will that be in respect of resolving some of these larger issues affecting Europe?<\/p><p>  The EU was expanded during the Irish Presidency with Croatia as a new member state.  I thinking of some other states, particularly in the Balkans, and the difficulties affecting Bosnia-Herzegovina.

It is those states that are being left behind.  Does the ambassador feel this could create instability in many regions?  Has the Lithuanian Presidency any plans in respect of that?  <\/p><p>  On the last occasion I was in Lithuania, I attended a conference on people trafficking.

This is one of the major issues.  We are talking about huge money being made out of the total exploitation of people.  Is that on the agenda for Lithuania?<\/p><p>  My colleague, Senator Reilly, raised the issue of prisons.  The interest for people here is the case of Michael Campbell who is in prison in Lithuania.  The information from his family and friends is that conditions are appalling and the courts seem to be backing that up.  The Presidency does not involve looking at one's own state but it is important that conditions be improved if international committees consider them inhumane and degrading.  I think we would all be concerned about that, particularly because of what Irish prisoners have gone through over the years.  Could the ambassador keep an eye on the situation involving that prisoner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100007#F00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1373551200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I will hand over to the ambassador.

Questions relating to the economic situation, instability and unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, form one package of issues that are top of the agenda in the EU and in the minds of leaders and politicians in EU member states.  In my presentation, I also put an emphasis on the economy and employment.  In particular, youth unemployment is at the core of our priorities.  There are no specific Lithuanian priorities in this regard.  This is all about continuity and the sense of urgency in this area.  We are taking over from Ireland and will continue in pushing forward whatever decisions are there to alleviate or stabilise the situation or address unemployment.  Further building of economic and monetary union, creating the banking union, implementing all the instruments that have been put forward among us in Europe like the European semester and all the other relevant documents and above all, agreeing on the multi-annual financial framework and giving the budget for Europe for 2014 are really important objectives to have the money flowing into the concrete programmes so that such initiatives as the youth guarantee and others can be adequately financed and spread out across countries.<\/p> <p>Lithuania is also very interested in availing of this opportunity since unemployment is also a problem there.  It is decreasing at the fastest rate in Europe but is still around 13%, and higher for youth unemployment.  There are further initiatives, including apprenticeships, the posted workers directive and some others which we see as moving in the direction of helping to deal with that issue.<\/p><p> We have significant energy relations with Russia, which is one of the biggest suppliers of energy to the European Union.  We want that relationship to be stable, predictable and based on all the rules we have in the EU the World Trade Organisation and other relevant forums.  Over-reliance on one supplier is not a good thing, so for countries such as Lithuania, which is very dependent on one external supplier, especially in the gas sector, it is important to have viable alternatives.  We are building bridges with the rest of the EU to provide these alternatives and running a number of projects to reduce our energy dependency.  There are many other related issues including energy efficiency.<\/p><p> The end of the political cycle in the EU and nearing the completion of the Commission mandate is a factor that impacts on our Presidency.  There are many initiatives on the agenda and we counted approximately 500 files at different levels of maturity.  In co-operation with the European Commission, the European Parliament and other member states, we need carefully to establish the most important priorities.  We had our three-year programme launched by Ireland, Lithuania and Greece.  That provides an 18-month framework.  Ireland has its own priorities and has adopted many important decisions, including EU-US trade and banking union.  We will continue to build on that and work on all these important files.<\/p><p> Trade with the US is important for the EU and Ireland, and very important for Lithuania, given the size of our country and our exposure to international markets.  We are an open, trading country and will work very vigorously to move those negotiations forward.  There was a meeting on Monday in Washington which launched these negotiations, which were agreed under the Irish Presidency.  We will work hard to proceed on that.  I do not want to prejudge any timelines but there is a full commitment on our side to move ahead with US trade negotiations.<\/p><p> I am not aware of the dual passports issue so maybe we can have that discussion and clarify that.  Regarding stateless persons, I am not aware of it as an issue in Lithuania.  When Lithuania was re-established in the 1990s, citizenship was granted to all our citizens regardless of nationality, so there are no stateless persons in Lithuania.  We do not have that issue there.<\/p><p> Neighbourhood policy is very much the priority for the Lithuanian Presidency.  When we speak about the EU as a global partner we firstly think about asserting our influence in our neighbourhood.  What is beyond our immediate borders is extremely important, be it the Eastern Partnership, the Mediterranean or the Russian Federation.  We must see that we have the right policies in place, that we encourage our partners to move closer to Europe and on a good European path in their development so that our relations are stable.  We must ensure they have their European future and move on to closer economic integration, becoming part of the internal market and getting as close as possible in political terms to the EU.  It falls under the Lithuanian Presidency to arrange a summit of EU partnerships that brings together all EU leaders and leaders from Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and three south Caucasus countries, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.  This summit is an opportunity to strike some important strategic decisions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>these countries such as an association agreement with Ukraine, provided Ukraine addresses some of the issues that Europe asks it to deal with.  These are European countries and they are our neighbours, and there are good economic prospects for co-operating with them.  It is extremely important to have these countries developing in a way that ensures a good European market economy and the protection of human rights and the rule of law.<\/p><p> Kaliningrad Oblast is also a neighbour to the west.  That is an important partner, as is the whole Russian Federation, so we have close ties with this region on the municipalities level and there are opportunities for tourism and cultural relations.  We are working on getting those relations on a good, stable footing and exploring the possibilities for co-operation there.<\/p><p> We are very much a pro-enlargement country and we welcome the European Council's decision to begin accession negotiations with Serbia.  We hope these negotiations will begin under our Presidency.  The major agreement we negotiated with Serbia was ratified by all countries and we have to start implementing that.  Other western Balkan countries are at a different level of relations with the EU and we hope they will proceed consistently towards the objective we set in Thessaloniki many years ago.  The destiny of these countries is within the EU so the work must be done on the ground to provide conditions for the EU to move ahead with negotiations.  We see potential to upgrade relations with a number of countries, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo.  We will be working to see that there is as much progress as possible, given the conditions on the ground and the framework of discussions and consensus we can see within the EU.<\/p><p> Regarding prisons, I do not have anything to add to what I said in reply to Senator Reilly's inquiry.<\/p> <p>If she provides me with more information on relevant documents from any reputable international organisations in which the conditions are described as degrading or inhumane I will seek answers in Vilnius on whether there is non-compliance in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100007#F00600","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Today's meeting is a continuation of the debate we are having on Ireland and the European Union.  Today's session will focus on the implications for Ireland of an evolving European Union in terms of the proposed completion of the economic and monetary union and necessary steps to bolster democratic accountability and legitimacy.  Committee members will be very aware of the recent views expressed by the ESRI on this matter and we are looking forward to hearing Professor FitzGerald's views on developments in the euro area and beyond.<\/p><p>    Before we begin, I remind witnesses and members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on or make charges against an individual or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

It is a pleasure to attend.  I will address three of the modules that have been identified and try to answer questions on the fourth module, economic policy and integration.<\/p><p>  I will make a few brief remarks on the first module, financial integration.  This is important for the creation of a single financial market in Europe.  The costs of the disintegration of the Single Market are high.  For example, <i>peque&ntilde;as y medianas empresas<\/i> - small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Spain - are paying interest rates that are 3% higher, under similar conditions, than those paid by SMEs in Germany.  There are also problems in that regard in Ireland.  It is impossible to have a level playing field with competitiveness in Europe if firms with the same risk characteristics are paying higher interest rates in one place than they are in another.  If one visited a branch of Bank of America in Palo Alto in the US with a set of risk characteristics, one would get the same terms as one would from a Bank of America branch in Newark or New Jersey.  We do not have that situation in Europe.  For this reason, banking union is necessary.<\/p><p>  We refer to banking union in terms of our legacy debts.  In a paper that I published with colleagues from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, we considered the costs of a European banking system versus national banking systems.  The former makes a sizeable difference for all of Europe.  It is important that we make progress.  By European standards, it should be rapid.<\/p><p>  Once European regulation is in place, there must be a European resolution system.  If the regulator screws up, the costs of a European failure cannot be imposed on a national entity.  The costs must be socialised across the EU.  A range of steps must be put in place.  By 2020, I hope to see similar credit conditions for firms in Ireland as obtain in France, Italy and Poland.<\/p><p>  On budgetary integration, my inclination is to do less rather than more where possible.  However, we saw how the bond market vigilantes were unleashed on us.  Since there was no European system to deal with the crisis, the bond markets priced Ireland out of the market and wrote us off as no-hopers in 2010.  Our colleagues in Europe helped to rescue us.  Europe has put in place a system that is better than using the bond market vigilantes to police fiscal policy, but they are always out there.  The current set-up is not ideal, but it is better than the alternative.<\/p><p>  We have changed the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.  I am unhappy with what occurred in this regard and in which respect we needed to pass a referendum.  The rules that have been put in place across Europe would not have prevented Ireland and Spain's disasters, as they focus on problems in fiscal policy.  The single best indicator of a pending crisis in Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia was the balance of payments current account.  This is one of the measures that the EU uses.  One reason for its omission is that the symmetry would imply that countries running large surpluses should take remedial action as well as countries running large deficits.  This failing weakens the process that has been put in place.<\/p><p>  One can make a mistake relying on rules.  We obeyed the Stability and Growth Pact.  That was the problem.  When the IMF and the EU visited the ESRI, we asked whether they would give Ireland a speeding ticket in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  They replied that they could not, as it was obeying the speed limit, namely, the Stability and Growth Pact.  Had there been no pact, the IMF would have been making more noise about our mistakes in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  An interesting paper by Dr. Jim O'Leary of NUI Maynooth goes through the advice given by the IMF and the EU and identifies this problem.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a final remark on budgetary integration.  I have gone through the blueprint produced by the European Commission and President Van Rompuy's statement.  Only once does counter-cyclical fiscal policy appear, and that is in respect of the suggestion of setting up an insurance fund.  The elephant in the room is that European fiscal policy is profoundly pro-cyclical.  Any basic economics 101 class would teach that this is not what should be done.  In February, as part of the EUROFRAME group of institutes, including two German institutes - the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and DIW Berlin - the Centraal Planbureau in the Netherlands and the national institute in London, we analysed the stance of fiscal policy last year, this year and next year in the eurozone at an aggregate level.  The effect of fiscal policy this year will be to reduce the growth rate of Europe by 1.5%.  Europe would be growing by 1% this year, not falling by 0.5%, were it not for an inappropriate fiscal policy.  There is nothing in the European Commission's proposals to bring about more co-ordination of fiscal policy.  When there is a cyclical downturn in any standard economy, one pumps money into it instead of removing it.  Ireland and Spain have no choice, but aggregate fiscal policy should be run in Europe's interests in the standard way as set out in a basic textbook.  That there is nothing in the EU documents on this is a failing.<\/p><p>  We do not have answers on my final point, but it is a considerable risk for Ireland.  By accident or design, the UK has decided to consider leaving the EU.  The political implications will dominate the economic ones and I will leave them to politicians.  The UK is unlikely to apply for associate membership, as it would need to obey all of the EU's rules on the Single Market without being at the table when those rules were decided.  This is not an option for the UK if it leaves.  In that case, we would need to impose the common external tariff on everything coming from the UK.  This means a customs barrier on the Border with the UK on this island.<\/p><p>  The economic implications for the UK and Ireland are considerable.  I suspect that the vultures are already gathering over the UK's economy.  The IDA is probably knocking on doors in the City in London and inviting companies that would prefer to be in the EU to come to the safety of Dublin.  The French vultures will be gathering around British aerospace in Bristol, where the wings of the Airbus A380 are made and from where they are taken, with great difficulty, to Toulouse to be assembled.  Why not do all of that work in France?  Nissan produces cars for Europe.  Suddenly, it will be subject to the common external tariff.<\/p><p>  There would be major problems for the UK and potential opportunities for Ireland, but it is a lose-lose situation.  What would happen to public procurement?  Irish firms selling to British firms are currently treated equally as EU firms.  Will British firms start buying British?  What rules will govern access for agricultural produce?  Will they be different, making access difficult?  This island has a common electricity market.  Will we need to erect customs barriers to check the electrons going through the wires?  This is unlikely, but it would disrupt us.  In terms of energy security, all of our gas comes through a pipeline through the UK.  The rules of the EU mean that, if there is a gas shortage, Irish people must be treated fairly like people in the UK.  If the UK is not a part of the EU, how can we ensure energy security?<\/p><p>  There are major issues for us.  There would be some wins, but probably many losses.  I have no answers.  We should be considering this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100010#J00100","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100010#J00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor FitzGerald and thank him for his frank appraisal of the situation.  He stated that he had no answers, but he set out a clear picture of a situation that needed to be attended to within the EU as a matter of urgency, that being, Britain's proposal to hold a referendum on exiting the EU.  The consequences would be serious.  The concept of the European entity that we have all discussed, lived with, worked for and strived towards for years could disintegrate.  I cannot see how it would be otherwise.  To postpone a decision of that nature is more debilitating than anything else that could be done.  The worst case scenario is likely to emerge.<\/p><p>  We have discussed another matter <i>ad infinitum<\/i>, that being, the degree to which each EU member state is willing to co-ordinate its efforts in economic and fiscal policy.  In our naivete, we believed that this co-ordination had been in operation for the past five, seven or ten years.  We now know better.  Professor FitzGerald's point is important.  To what extent are we serious about co-ordination now and how effective will it be?<\/p> <p> My last point is on taking money out of the economy to re-inflate or pump it up.  How effective will that be without some price controls?  Let me give an example.  In 1978 house property prices were removed from the consumer price index because it was felt that they would distort inflation and so on.  In the most recent boom house property prices increased by between 300% and 400% in a short space of time.  That happened in an insidious manner as far as the economy was concerned.  Many commentators, along with ourselves as political representatives, were unaware of the accelerated speed of inflation and the damage it was doing to the economy.  The property market became the bank and the financial institutions became the collateral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100010#J00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373553600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and call Senator Healy Eames.

I concur with the professor's fearful outline of what might happen if the Conservative Party gains an overall majority in Britain and goes ahead with its opt in or out scenario in regard to Europe.  The committee invited a witness here from the British Conservative Party who is a spokesperson on the role of Britain in Europe.  Some of us found his position worrying, to say the least.  What mostly worries us, having spoken to members of the Labour Party in England, is the sense of fatalism that even British industry, which Professor FitzGerald said would lose out, does not seem to be launching a defensive strategy on behalf of membership of Europe.  Does the professor have an opinion on England opting in or out of Europe?<\/p><p>  We, as politicians, have been confronted with the simple slogan \"Austerity doesn't work.\"  We need growth in jobs in the European arena and we have always argued for that.  I understand - perhaps this links to what Senator Healy Eames said - that we have spent nearly every penny of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, or it has been set aside for job creation.  We have also agreed that if we nationalise certain parts of the State and public sector, some of the money will fund growth in employment.  We are also compelled to do so by the troika.  <\/p><p>  People have proclaimed loudly that austerity is not working.  Interestingly, the Lithuanians undertook very severe measures and now have relatively healthy growth.  Does the professor have an opinion on that?  Can he suggest what we can do domestically?

Also, Deputy Eric Byrne asked whether anyone in the UK had examined the implications, and I am afraid it might be the case that they have not.  I asked two colleagues in the United Kingdom whether they were studying the issue and both said that they would not go near it.  In order to understand the implications for us we need to understand the implications for them.  For instance, BAE Systems in Bristol and Nissan in the north of England are at risk, as are many other firms.  My suspicion is that when these  companies think about it, and if I am right about their being at risk, there will be change in view and, hopefully, a more realistic response.<\/p><p>  No more than ourselves, Britain needs a national debate.  We know about having national debates on these issues for referendums.  Britain may need to try twice to get the right answer but it has a lot of work to do.  What can we do about it?  That is a scary question.  Barring acting like a marriage counsellor and trying to reconcile two warring parties, Ireland must examine the matter as an insurance policy and examine whether we can do anything.  For example, there has been talk about major investment in Ireland in wind power in order to export it to the United Kingdom, but the concern is as follows.  Let us say &euro;3 billion is invested in Ireland in order to help Britain meet its EU obligations under the renewables directive, but Britain then changes its mind.  Are we left with &euro;3 billion worth of dud windmills?  Contracts that are enforceable in London are needed in order to guarantee such investment.  We need to start thinking about how to protect ourselves from such a hopefully limited possibility.<\/p><p>  In terms of co-ordination and whether we are serious about the co-ordination of fiscal policy at a European level, we have been forced to go down that route because, for understandable reasons, the people who lent the money want to be certain that they will get it back.  That is a fair cop.  I spoke to one colleague who is a very good German economist.  When he was faced with the idea that Europe had to regulate French fiscal policy he said that he did not want to go near it.  When one comes down to it, each country wants to protect its own independence in this regard.  If we want to go down the co-ordination route then we must examine the issue of a co-ordinated fiscal response to a crisis like the current one.  If one is going to have all sorts of regulation regarding fiscal policy then one must have regulation that will ensure the one acts counter-cyclically and not pro-cyclically within Europe.  <\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames raised the issue of a banking union.  It is a long-term issue but we have a particular interest in it and in terms of legacy debt we want to see it done.  However, it is important to get it right in the long term.  Europe, not Ireland, faces a big problem with its banking system.  What if something suddenly happened to it next year?  Nobody is sure where there will be problems.  If something happened it would be better to have a European framework to deal with the problem.  The short-term issue refers to the short-term banking problem, not so much in Ireland but in other countries.  We must have a mechanism in place in order that we do not have continuing crisis.  <\/p><p>   Deputy Eric Byrne asked about Ireland's fiscal path and people claiming that austerity does not work.  Last January I published a paper in a French journal that examined the history of major adjustments in Europe.  Interestingly, in the 1990s Finland undertook a major adjustment programme, but there was no improvement in public finances.<\/p> <p>In fact, they got worse for the first few years, but borrowing abroad improved dramatically.  It is really only when one eases off on the fiscal adjustment that one sees the benefits.  It is similar to the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and early 1990s, or Ireland in the 1980s, where the first two budgets of the coalition government between 1982 and 1987 were really tough - probably tougher than anything we have seen in the current crisis - but they eased off after that.  One did not see the benefits, or the fact that fiscal policy was being improved.  There was very little progress.  Once one eases off, one sees the adjustments.  It is only when we have largely completed the adjustment - and if Europe recovers - we will see recovery here.  Austerity works in terms of getting one's public finances right, but one does not see the benefits quickly. <\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne asked what we can do to create jobs.  We must do what we have to do, and I published something yesterday on this issue.  One thing we did not address, which my colleagues and many others have thought about, is how one does it in a smart way which is more employment-friendly.  One of the things we recommended, which is being implemented and is generally accepted, was a move to property tax.  We have to raise taxes somewhere.  Property tax is better than taxes on incomes and it is less negative to jobs, although it is pretty unpleasant.  If we have to raise taxes, we must do so in a way that is jobs-friendly.<\/p><p> I refer to Irish Water.  We are under-investing in water and should be investing more in it.  Every cent we invest in water is a borrowing requirement and it is a drag on us.  If we manage to set up Irish Water as an independent entity like the ESB, which is not part of the Government accounts, can borrow on its own account and has revenue-raising powers so it covers all its costs from its bills - this is why we need water charges - then it is out of the Government accounts.  If one capitalised Irish Water at &euro;5 billion, to include &euro;2 billion of Government equity, and if it was able to borrow &euro;3 billion on the market to buy the assets, it could undertake a much bigger investment programme which would not be part of the Government accounts and would be fully funded by future charges on people, which would be very unpopular.  However, there is a smart way to do this and we must think a bit more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100011#K00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373554200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald for his contribution.  I agree completely with the point he made about the UK, its environment and its relationship with the European Union.  One of the challenges we face is that we are so immersed in the here and now and that the political and government systems are so immersed in the unemployment crisis, the fiscal crisis and the social challenges with which Professor FitzGerald will be familiar, that we do not have the space to engage in the what if question.  One of the biggest \"what if\" questions is the one Professor FitzGerald mentioned, namely, what happens if the United Kingdom decides to leave the European Union?<\/p><p>  I spend a lot of time in the UK, as many Irish people do.  There is a wonderful argument to be made as to why the UK should stay in the EU.  It is all about the thing which has always mattered to the United Kingdom and which Mrs. Thatcher realised was the great jewel in the crown, namely, access to the Common Market.  The big question is whether anybody in the UK is willing to make that argument.  We will find out the answer to that question in the next 12 to 18 months in terms of what the Labour Party decides to do and what happens in the Conservative Party.  One of the consequences of the terrible difficulty we are in is that we have forfeited the ability to think about the big issue, to which Professor FitzGerald referred.  I would be interested to hear his view on that.  <\/p><p>  I refer to three economic points Professor FitzGerald made, including the point about the balance of payments and the fact it is absent in the kind of current eurozone thinking.  I always interpret balance of payments quite crudely as being the difference between what a country sells and what it takes in.  Since the eurozone was created, it has made that mistake.  Nobody ever talks about the balance of payments.  The most amazing example of that was when all sorts of self-styled experts proclaimed Ireland would default.  Their attention was never drawn to the fact we had a balance of payments surplus.  The fact that is absent currently is entirely consistent with the history of the eurozone.  Nobody ever talks about that issue.  It is one of the big problems we need to address. <\/p><p>  I refer to fiscal policy and would like to develop a point Senator Healy Eames made, which cuts to the heart of it.  Whenever I put the case to people that co-ordination of fiscal policy should not mean everybody doing the same thing, the answer I get comprises two things.  The first is another question: if Germany, Holland or another country decided it wanted to re-inflate its economy, who would lend it money?  Second, if someone did so, would it leave the country immediately and go to Asia?  What is Professor FitzGerald's view on that?  <\/p><p>  I refer to banking union.  To put it very simply, one of the causes of our crisis is that banks stopped lending to each other, the ECB stepped in to provide the money and the ECB is trying to get back its money in different ways from different countries.  Banking union should, hopefully, create the ability of banks to lend to each other again.  Would the early phase of a banking union not create the capacity to further weaken national banking systems all over again?  Implicit in the creation of a banking union is the idea that banks can fail.  If that possibility is there, surely that means banks which have that risk hanging over them will find it more difficult to raise money and will have to offer depositors more money to put their money into the bank and so on.  Some of the weaknesses which are probably there within national banking systems could be exacerbated in the early phase of a banking union.<\/p><p>  I will conclude with an analogy which I put to an earlier guest, who completely disagreed with me.  One of the challenges we face is that the bond markets lent to Greece, Ireland or Portugal at the same rate they lent to Germany, but they are not doing that at the moment.  People also lent to banks at the same rate, regardless of how healthy the bank was.  One of the consequences of a banking union is that might not happen anymore.  If that is the case, will the early phase not be a rocky ride?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100012#L00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373554200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>In terms of what Deputy Donohoe said about the big issue - that is, that we have been so caught up in the crisis that we have not really thought about what comes after - the same is true of Europe in terms of its thinking on fiscal policy.  It is about dealing with the current crisis.  To some extent, because we are reaching a certain stage, maybe we can start to think again.  If one comes from a mendicant country, people expect one to put the Irish case and one finds it very difficult to talk at a European level.  Hopefully, we are re-establishing our credentials to talk at a European level.<\/p><p>  On the current account balance of payments, if one goes through the D&aacute;il debates in the 1950s, it was the big issue.  People wrongly said it would not be a problem with monetary union.  Olivier Blanchard, who is the chief economist in the IMF, wrote a very nice article in 2001 in which he contrasted Ireland and Spain and said Spain had a current account deficit which was not sustainable and that Ireland had a surplus and was doing okay.  He was right at the time but I felt he was a bit gung-ho in 2001 because things were beginning to head in the wrong direction.  He has been consistent.  The European Commission now realises it must pay more attention to this.<\/p> <p> On the question of fiscal policy and whether Germany or other countries should reflate, this is a problem.  If we are going to have co-ordinated policy, that should probably happen.  However, my German colleagues make a valid argument that the German economy is rather like a supertanker that is beginning to turn.  Labour costs are rising in Germany because of a very tight labour market and over time the German economy will gradually price itself in such a way that the current account surplus will fall.  I would not advocate policy in Germany to bring down the current account surplus.  However, if we are going to have co-ordinated policy in Europe, it should be to reflate the European economy, which would involve the countries that have a surplus doing something about it.  Frankly, that is not going to happen now.<\/p><p> The question is really whether we will have agreement for a co-ordinated policy in place for the next crisis.  On that, an important decision was taken by the French Government in May when President Hollande announced that France was not going to and should not meet its target and the Commission agreed.  Instead of making further cuts, France was going to let what economists refer to as &quot;automatic stabilisers&quot; work.  I see this as a major breakthrough.  What the IMF has said in its most recent report and every report for Ireland is that the country has set its target in terms of cuts and that it should do the cuts and make the increases in taxation.  However, if it does not meet the targets in terms of borrowing requirements, it should not do more.  In March last year, the central planning bureau in the Netherlands produced a report saying the Netherlands was not going to meet its target.  On the same day, an article written by the bureau's director was printed in the <i>Financial Times <\/i>saying the Netherlands should not meet the target.  The government disagreed and then collapsed.  Another election took place, followed by a further round of austerity - the wrong policy.<\/p><p> On the issue of a weakening national banking system, there is a potential problem.  In banking crises, if the issue can be swept under the carpet and growth is achieved, it will all go away.  Our problem was too big.  It was an elephant in the room and there was no sweeping it under the carpet.  The policy across Europe has largely been to sweep the problem under the carpet, but this policy has come unstuck in Spain.  I am not sure we can maintain this policy.  A bank may need capital, but it is only if it is insolvent that bondholders and others will be burnt.  It is a question of putting more money into the bank and whether it comes to the private sector.  <\/p><p> We need to think about what type of banking system we would like in 2020.  Currently, banks in Ireland and across Europe borrow at different rates, because they have different risks.  The cost of borrowing for Irish banks is very high, relatively, and if, for example, Deutsche Bank took over AIB, it would be able to fund itself at a much lower cost.  Therefore, while it might not make money on tracker mortgages - on which our banks are losing hugely -  it would not lose money on them.  It is not that we would let banks go to the wall, but a more integrated system would mean a world where bigger and stronger banks gobble up smaller banks.  This is what is happening in the US.  This might be better for Europe and would be the way to produce a European banking system.  However, we need a lot of things to happen first.<\/p><p> There are issues such as not having national banks.  For example, Poland faced a major problem in the current crisis.  It came through without any fall in output, but its banks were foreign-owned.  The Austrian regulator said that Austrian banks with branches in Poland could not lend money there, but should keep it in Austria.  The Poles were faced with the danger that without banks of their own, nobody would provide credit.  Contrary to EU rules, the regulators in different countries were saying credit could not be provided in Poland and should be kept at home.  It is in situations like this we need a banking union.  We need a union so that there is a level playing field.  I heard the CEO of UniCredit say he had to charge 2% more in a branch in the Dolomites on the Italian side of the border than in a branch on the Austrian side.  That is wrong.  We need banking regulation to level the playing field in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013071100012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373554800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank Professor FitzGerald for what has been a very informative presentation and for answering our questions.

I am delighted that Dr. Stephen Farry, Minister for Employment and Learning in the Northern Ireland Executive is here with us today.  We hope to have a good engagement and conversation with him.  This subject is not new to the committee.  We have highlighted education as an area worthy of consideration and we would like to explore where there are synergies and integrated strategies in education with mutual benefits.  This is a pragmatic committee which prefers practical and common-sense solutions.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Stephen Farry.  We are also joined by Mr. Chris Andrews and Ms Judith Shaw from the education division of the Northern Ireland Department for Employment and Learning.  Our witnesses are all very welcome.<\/p><p>  The committee has held a series of meetings to consider cross-Border co-operation in education. We have already met with our Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, the presidents of the institutes of technology in the Border region - Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk - and with St. Angela&rsquo;s and the University of Ulster teacher training colleges.  On our regular visits to Northern Ireland we have noted how educational attainment impacts on the progress of many communities, as we see in our constituencies here in the South.  We look forward to Dr. Farry&rsquo;s contribution and to exploring with him the potential for synergies to enhance co-operation in this very important area.<\/p><p>  Before Dr. Farry makes his presentation it is important to point out that we have one common political ground, North and South, which is the challenge of youth unemployment.  We need a twenty-first century third level system to adapt to the changing needs, be it in industry or employment trends.  That is an area in which researchers in all our universities North and South can work together.  We look forward to hearing Dr. Farry&rsquo;s contribution and no doubt committee members will make their own observations and suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100003#C00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373540400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind welcome and the invitation to come here this afternoon to address the committee.  I hope that my presentation is illuminating.  I appreciate that the committee members are very tired so I hope that I do not send them back to sleep.  We welcome the opportunity to raise these issues and to explore them.<\/p><p>  I will make a few general opening comments and set out some of the issues that are on the landscape, and hope that we have a good exchange through questions and answers and further exploration of some of these issues.  The central message I am keen to get across today is that while there is a degree of co-operation and collaboration in further and higher education on the island of Ireland it is significantly below its potential.  There is significant capacity for growth in terms of student flows in both directions and in the development of research.  I had planned to speak primarily about higher and further education but towards the end, given the Chairman&rsquo;s remarks, I will make a few brief comments on youth unemployment which is such a particularly acute issue for us all.<\/p><p>  Last year in Northern Ireland we published our first ever higher education strategy, entitled Graduating to Success.  One of the projects in that strategy is to facilitate greater cross-Border collaboration and student mobility.  I would like to think that by the end of 2013 we will have identified targets in conjunction with our higher education institutions for greater expansion of North-South co-operation and we should be looking to meet many of those targets by the end of this decade.  I am also pleased to say that Tom Boland from the Higher Education Authority in the South is part of that project team so there is already on-going engagement with Government officials here in that regard.<\/p><p>  The context in which we work is partially set by the report published by IBEC and CBI in 2011, A Study of Obstacles to Cross-Border Undergraduate Education.  This was discussed in an Assembly debate in October 2012 and at that stage the Assembly agreed to take forward the recommendations in that report.  There are probably four out of the nine recommendations that are particularly relevant to our discussions, one relates to the quality of information available to students and we are addressing that under the higher education strategy.  Another relates to student support for students domiciled in Northern Ireland who may be studying in the Republic of Ireland.  From 2013-14 on there will be a new form of student support which hopefully will address some of the anomalies highlighted in that report and better facilitate students from Northern Ireland studying in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p>  Another issue, which is perhaps the most thorny in the short term, relates to an issue around the recognition of A level qualifications and equivalency for university entry into institutions in the Republic of Ireland.  My colleague, John O&rsquo;Dowd, has commissioned a report in conjunction with the Irish Universities Association and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is expected to be made available to both governments and the Irish university presidents during the coming months.  The final relevant recommendation for our own Department relates to research into higher education student flows and I will return to that topic in a few moments.<\/p><p> Other initiatives should be noted.  We support Universities Ireland, which has been established by nine universities across the island.  It receives funding of &pound;25,000 from both jurisdictions for the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, which provides secretariat support.  The undergraduate awards have been in place since 2008.  Both governments co-administer the McManus all-Ireland scholarship scheme which is funded by J. P. McManus.  This scheme supports our own Department's widening access strategy.  <\/p><p> The US-Ireland research and development partnership includes a number of eligible areas such as nanotechnology, sensor technology, energy and sustainability, telecommunications and health.  To date, 12 projects have been supported.  It is worth noting that President Obama addressed an audience in Belfast on 17 June 2013 and he chose to highlight that partnership in particular and more broadly he indicated the opportunities that exist for research and collaboration.  I am very conscious that we are living in a more globalised age and this includes in the area of high-level research.  There is a need to upscale of the size of research projects and as a consequence, greater collaboration is needed.  Northern Ireland has high-achieving targets set under the Barroso task force and there is a need to improve the drawing down of competitive European funds.  I refer to framework seven which deals with research and development and which in due course will become Horizon 2020.  My Department and the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment have established a &pound;1.8 million EU support fund which provides a network of Northern Ireland contact points for research applications.  These will link closely with the national contact points in the Republic of Ireland through an all-island EU steering group.  We look with a degree of admiration to the level of draw-down of those competitive funds within the Republic of Ireland and this serves as an example for us.<\/p><p> On the issue of further education, the flow of students is very much one-way traffic which is from the South to the North.  This situation is particularly acute in the north west of the island.  The North-West Regional College has over 3,000 students from the South.  To a large extent this reflects the relative lack of capacity in vocational education and training courses in the County Donegal area.  This can be contrasted with other Border areas where there is a much broader range of post-leaving certificate course provision or vocational colleges.  That flow drops to approximately one fifth relative to the situation in the north west.  The great distortion in the flow is very evident.<\/p><p> Given that we are in the European Union we fund and support students from the Republic of Ireland just as we do for students from any other part of the EU.  In the short term, this may become a source of tension, given the funding implications for the Northern Administration.  However, we are co-operating closely with our counterparts in the Department of Education and Skills.  I raised the issue with my counterpart Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in November 2012, on the margins of the NSMC meeting.  Officials from both our Departments have agreed to collect and examine the data with a view to providing a joint report.  The terms of reference of that exercise are due to be agreed in September 2013.  It will study both higher education and higher education flows.<\/p><p> Northern Ireland students only account for about 1% of the student population enrolled in HEA-supported institutions in this jurisdiction.  By contrast, the number of Southern students in Northern Irish universities amounts to about 4.5%.  This illustrates a significant imbalance.  In the past a much higher percentage of Northern students opted to study in the South but for various reasons in the past number of decades there has been a significant falling-off.  There are barriers around entry to universities and also a lack of information which need to be addressed.  I suggest these issues could be explored in the question and answer session.  <\/p><p> It was feared that a much different funding regime in Northern Ireland compared with the Republic of Ireland would create incentives which would further distort student flows.  However, both jurisdictions have moved in a common direction around student support and charges to students which in my view will produce a fairly level playing field on the island which will be of assistance in due course.<\/p><p> While I am highlighting these distortions in flows and the current imbalances, it would be wrong for the committee to confine its discussion to what steps can be taken to correct those imbalances within the current quantum of student flows.  I return to my opening comments that we see a potential for a much greater collaboration on student flows on the island.  With a rising tide those distortions should be evened out without the issues becoming a major source of tension between the two jurisdictions in the medium term.  I stress that in the short term there are issues which we need to explore together.<\/p><p> I will return to the issue of youth unemployment, which is a very thorny issue in Northern Ireland, as it is in the Republic of Ireland.  We are conscious that this is an issue throughout the European Union.  Our figures currently run at approximately 20% of young people actively seeking work and who are currently out of work.  That is a major cost to our economy and also a cost in terms of wasted lives and opportunities.  There is a real danger that the investment in people's skills will be lost as those skills become rusty.  We also have very heavy concentrations of unemployment among young people.  Our unemployment profile is heavily skewed.  Almost one in three of those who are unemployed fall within the 18 to 24 age group.  We have a number of schemes in place, as is the case in this jurisdiction, which attempt to address that issue.  We place a very heavy focus on work experience opportunities because that is what the international community stresses as being the best way of addressing this problem.  We are also conscious that the European Union, under the Irish Presidency, has in the past weeks put together a &euro;6 billion fund to assist with youth unemployment.  There may be differences in terms of the eligibility of our jurisdiction compared to this jurisdiction and this was raised by the Taoiseach at the North-South Ministerial Council last week.  There is a commitment that officials from both jurisdictions will meet in September to explore the opportunities to take that initiative forward.<\/p><p> I am happy to answer questions.  I will pass any difficult questions to Mr. Andrews or Ms Shaw.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I come from County Monaghan.  A true university of Ulster would have to encompass the whole nine counties of Ulster, not just the six in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>None of the other three counties has a university.  Traditionally in Monaghan prospective students would have been very aware of what courses were available in both Queen's University and the University of Ulster at Coleraine. What can be done to facilitate both of those universities in having a better outreach programme which will ensure young people in the three counties are fully aware of what is available and are encouraged to consider what are, in effect, their local universities?<\/p><p> The Chairman observed that most of the flow is from the Border counties into the Republic.  There are slight cultural differences which have developed over the years in this regard.  From the perspective of people in the South, some might feel wary of going to college in the North, for example, or they might wish to remain in the eurozone.  Simple issues like securing accommodation can also be an issue, or the desire to remain in an education system with which one feels comfortable.  I am sure it is exactly the same for young people in Northern Ireland when they think about pursuing their third level education in the South.  Steps must be taken to increase the linkages between the two jurisdictions, perhaps by way of outreach programmes at local third level campuses in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, to ensure the full scope of courses is available to students.  Unfortunately, counties Cavan and Monaghan have some of the lowest rates of third level attainment in the country, which is an issue that must be addressed.  Many young people in the Border area identify with the North more so than with Dublin, but there is no correlation or linkage there.  Anything that can be done to encourage third level participation and enhance the opportunity for educational attainment must be explored.  It might not be the central focus of the work being done in this regard in Northern Ireland, but there is certainly potential in those three Ulster counties to increase the intake for the two Northern universities.

I also welcome his colleagues, Ms Shaw and Mr. Andrews.  My question relates to the disjoint between North and South in the area of education and how we might tackle it.  Some weeks ago this committee heard presentations from delegates of three of the institutes of technology located along the Border, namely, Dundalk, Sligo and Letterkenny.  I have been in contact with the delegates since then and they are anxious to pursue the matter, including by way of presentations to the relevant committees in the North.  Their collective message, which also applies to the other colleges, is that their presence is almost invisible in the North.  This is of particular note when one considers the demographics, which point to a fall in the number of 18 year olds in the North but a projected increase in the South.  What potential has been identified in this regard and are efforts being made to enhance collaboration right across the island?

As I said, the Deputy's point is well made.  For may part, I have no particular axe to grind in terms of where students are coming from.  I welcome a free flow of students throughout these islands.  The most important thing is that people are making choices which are informed by good information and which best suit themselves and their own career progression.  There will be a variance in terms of the nature of courses that are provided by different universities.  A greater degree of collaboration between North and South will allow our different institutions to specialise to a greater extent and, in so doing, facilitate better choice for all concerned.<\/p><p>  That said, we obviously have to take decisions around funding regimes.  There will always be different systems depending upon the jurisdiction of origin of students, but one hopes they would operate within similar parameters and would not create too many distortions in the flows between the two jurisdictions.  It is fair to say there has been a turning away in terms of natural synergies that might have existed around the Border areas in recent generations.  For instance, the strong tradition historically of Northern students studying in Trinity College has fallen off very heavily in recent years.  Information is key in terms of access.  We are very keen to ensure our local universities market themselves to prospective students throughout the island and that  career advisers in this jurisdiction would provide information in terms of the availability of courses.

I am very conscious that there is pressure on places in the Republic as a consequence of the growing population.  In contrast, we do not have the same demographic pressures in Northern Ireland.  That would, at first glance, indicate there is a partial solution in terms of some of the  excess demand in the South being met in the North.  However, it should be borne in mind that we have our own challenge in terms of encouraging local students who would have opted historically to study in Great Britain to instead remain in Northern Ireland.  While our third level participation rate, at 50%, is very high, some two thirds of that number are accounted for by people studying in Britain and only one third in our local institutions.  In other words, our higher education footprint is actually quite small relative to its potential.  In that context, we are looking to see how we can scale up our presence overall.  By 2015, for instance, we intend to provide at least 1,200 additional places, possibly more, in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, area.  Ultimately this is about facilitating the free movement of students, and encouraging greater participation by students from the South might well be part of it.<\/p><p>  Equally, I would encourage the Southern jurisdiction to examine how it can expand its own provision.

Again, the one relating County Donegal was not seen as really meeting the aspirations of the policy that was being set.  There is a very particular problem that exists in the context of what is happening in the northwest.  While there are challenges to be faced across the island in terms of developing collaboration, we have a very acute issue not just around the Border in general but in the northwest in particular.  That is something to which we must attend and which the colleagues of Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, are not shy about discussing.  We must pay particular attention to expanding the Magee campus.  I will just get that one out of the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373542200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>We can discuss that one over a cup of tea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100006#F00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1373542200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  This is an extremely important matter.  In the context of cross-Border co-operation and the challenges we face, it is very upsetting that we have not really tackled youth unemployment.  When the 1% and Trinity College are removed from the equation, the figures that are left are very stark.  At the most recent meetings they attended, those from the colleges admitted that they had perhaps been asleep at the wheel.  There were markets here in the South and north of the Border, but people were looking further afield.  Huge opportunities existed but it is obvious that we failed.  We can put on all the shows we want in the King's Hall and put in place various networks but we must make matters easier for those involved in order to attract more students.  Obviously, it was less expensive for students from the South to go to college in Northern Ireland.  What does the Minister believe could be done in this regard?  Could incentives be put in place?  We can talk around this matter but perhaps some capital investment should be made in the context of trying to get students to attend colleges.  St Angela's in Sligo, which is located near to where I live, faced a huge challenge in the context of being subsumed into the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  Those who run the institution were obliged to think outside the box.  There is a market north of the Border and St. Angela's offers courses in nursing and home economics, which are very practical subjects.  It may be time to get everyone together and perhaps this is happening.<\/p><p>  What action can we take?  Can we put in place some form of monetary incentives?  Once someone from Belfast attends college in Sligo or someone from Sligo goes to the University of Ulster Coleraine, the link is established.  Politicians receive correspondence each day and we might breeze through most of this.  However, there is nothing better than receiving a letter from someone from Sligo who has gone to Coleraine to attend university or from a person from Coleraine or Belfast who is attending university in Dublin or Galway.

If we are to be realistic with regard to collaboration, then we should not focus on who is going where.  There is a bigger picture - particularly if one views it at the macro rather than the micro level - which must be taken into account.  We should be discussing an all-Ireland context with regard to providing the optimum when it comes to educational facilities and an education system across the 32 counties.  I am surprised that there is such a differential in terms of the number of students who travel north <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the number who travel south.  When I attended UCD, there were quite a number of students from north of the Border there.  The Minister referred to Donegal, a county with which the Chairman is more familiar than any of the rest of us.  Letterkenny Institute of Technology is a renowned facility with a huge student population.  Just to the south of it are located Sligo Institute of Technology and St. Angela's College.  On the east cost is Dundalk Institute of Technology and, as Deputy Conlan indicated, there are two institutes of further education in Cavan and Monaghan.  There is quite an amount of educational provision in place at present, but this must be built upon.<\/p><p>  By 2009, the South had achieved the highest level of participation in tertiary education in the European Union.  That was a dramatic improvement in just ten to 15 years.  We were well ahead of Britain, France and Germany at that point.  The level of participation to which I refer was evidence that there had been a huge growth in the capacity of our further and third level institutions to cater for the increased demand.  Quite a number of those present at this meeting live in either southern or northern Border counties and we are aware of the particular bugbear that is duplication.  There is a need to eliminate the latter, which we see occurring each day in different programmes in our constituencies.  I am of the view that action must be taken at the macro level in order that we might provide the optimal return for students and for society in general.  We cannot have a situation where all institutes of technology and universities specialise in every subject.  There is room to eliminate some of the unnecessary duplication that exists in order to ensure that we will obtain a better return for students.  I am of the opinion that, as with health, we should opt for a centre-of-excellence model.  There is a need for arts and humanities courses in every college but there are subject areas in which, as a result of the small number of students involved, one or two colleges might be tasked with providing the necessary courses.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to framework 7.  In order for some of the programmes involved in this regard to draw down funding from the Directorate-General for Research &amp;amp; Innovation of the European Union, sometimes there must be more than one member state involved which is very beneficial.  Having served as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I am aware that there was huge co-operation between Teagasc - our agriculture and food development authority - and its equivalent in Northern Ireland.  Teagasc and a number of other State agencies have been phenomenally successful in drawing down substantial funding from Europe during the past ten to 15 years and bringing them to this jurisdiction in the form of a transfer of resources, which has proven to be very beneficial.  In order to optimise these kind of returns for the entire island, there must be better co-operation.  Governments and Departments can put general policy in place but it is the people who operate at the coalface - namely, the colleges and other institutions - which must drive the collaboration to which I refer at local level.  Continually discussing who is going where in the context of third level education has led us down a cul-de-sac.  People must see the bigger picture.<\/p><p>  On this island there is a major problem with unemployment.  Previous speakers referred to the difficulties with youth unemployment, North and South.  In addition, there continue to be skills shortages in certain areas.  Has a concerted effort been made to address such shortages in an all-Ireland context?  I accept that education does not just involve preparing people to take up employment.  However, it is part of the remit of our educational systems.  In the context of the job vacancies that exist across the island, are the two Departments doing enough - in co-operation with each other - to prepare people to take up such vacancies?  I recall canvassing at the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, during the most recent referendum campaign on an EU treaty.  I thought I knew Dublin reasonably well but I was amazed by the number of non-Irish citizens who work in the IFSC.  Those to whom I refer obviously came to Ireland in order to fill job vacancies in particular areas.  These people are very welcome to come here to work.  I spoke to a number of individuals at the centre and discovered that there are job opportunities for people regardless of from where they come.  Has a concerted effort been made to address the skills shortages that exist?  In that context, I reiterate that it is not just a question of preparing people to fill job vacancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100006#F00600","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1373542200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Mr. Paul Maskey will be our final contributor before the Minister replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100006#F00700","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373542800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the team for attending.  I wish to follow on from Deputy Brendan Smith's points regarding the high rate of young people unemployed and the category of NEETs, those who are not in employment, education or training.  I hosted a meeting in my constituency about seven weeks ago with organisations delivering in this area and I was taken aback by the number of organisations.  Approximately 20 organisations were delivering in that area and while some of them were doing tremendous work, on which they must be commended, I had not even heard of some of the others.  That is a major issue for this committee.  I try to put people in my constituency in the right direction with regard to organisations but there is some confusion among our young people.  We asked questions and some of the organisations could tell us the number of jobs created on the other side but some could not tell us the number created.  It is startling that some of the organisations delivering in this area could not tell us the outcomes in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am aware there are similar problems in the South.  Is there collaboration between Departments, North and South, in working on this area?  If not, can that be enhanced in terms of examining best practice models?  Some organisations are doing tremendous work but I am not sure about other organisations.  If there are models in both jurisdictions, can we determine if something could be blended together to ensure we provide an excellent service for our young people, thereby reducing unemployment rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100007#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maskey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1373542800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>There is a wide range of issues to touch upon.  I will begin with the issue of the nature of the formal collaboration on a North-South basis in terms of the institutional way we are addressing this area.  To be frank, this is something that has been working well under its capacity since the Good Friday Agreement, and we should acknowledge that.  In part it relates to the particular nature of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, structures.  As members will be aware, there are a number of formalised areas where there is bilateral co-operation and a requirement for meetings.  Those were fairly hastily determined in the heat of the final negotiations around the Good Friday Agreement and were not the subject of a formal analysis.  While there is co-operation at a formal institutionalised level within the NSMC around other forms of education, there is none in regard to further or higher education.  I am open to that changing in the context of a review of those structures but that is a much bigger political issue.  Others in my part of the world may have reservations about formally extending the nature of the institutional co-operation around those issues.  In the absence of that, it depends upon the drive in terms of those leading the respective Departments.  When I assumed office I was struck by the relative lack of engagement that had taken place.  It is still not perfect but I and my officials are keen to increase the degree of dialogue we are having around these issues.  I discussed the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and from both our perspectives, we are not getting overly hung up about whether the institutional arrangements are formally changed, but we have both given a commitment that we will work in a pragmatic way, be it at ministerial level or giving directions to our officials to work bilaterally around these issues.  I firmly believe that we have a good working relationship and that we are addressing issues and opportunities as they arise.<\/p><p>  There are a number of common issues, North and South, on which there is a potential for greater sharing and engagement around information and various programmes we have in place.  Sometimes, we will formalise that.  To give an example, we had an official from the Department of Education and Skills on the review of adult apprenticeships that we undertook in Northern Ireland in 2011.  That  was done as a precursor to a similar initiative to be brought forward in this jurisdiction.  We are currently engaged in a major review of apprenticeship policy in Northern Ireland and I note, with great interest, that a similar initiative has been announced in the South.  I would be keen that we would share notes and experiences around that.  <\/p><p>  That in turn points to what we should be doing to address youth unemployment.  The levels of youth unemployment around Europe are in part a feature of different levels of demand but they are also a product of skills shortages and skills mismatches.  Simply relying upon a general education system, whether it be further education, higher education or the school system, to churn out young people who are job-ready is unrealistic.  We may largely hit the mark but at times there will be an inefficiency in that there is a strong role to be played in terms of work-based training through apprenticeships.  We are very keen to significantly expand the range of occupations to which apprenticeships are applied and also the levels at which apprenticeships are applied.  Apprenticeships should be seen as part of higher level skills, not something that people do if they fail to get into university.  They should seen as an genuine alternative pathway to the more formalised route through higher education.  We have much to learn from some of our European partners - particularly Germany, Austria and Switzerland, although the latter is not formally part of the Union - in this regard.  That is an exciting opportunity in both parts of the island which should go some way towards addressing some of the particular skills pressures that we have found.<\/p><p>  That in turn relates to the issue of NEETs.  These are people who are technically unemployed but would be perhaps further away from the labour market because they face some particular barriers or they have not had the same opportunities as others.  There has been a very significant increase in the provision of resources for NEETs during the past 18 months and hopefully that is filtering through on ground.  That was probably what Mr. Maskey picked up on in his constituency.  We would be keen to sit down with him and map exactly out what he is saying and point him in the direction of what are new projects and what are pre-existing projects that may not be performing as well as they should be.  There will shortly be a new round of funds under the European Social Fund which will refresh a lot of that offering.  This area is a major priority for the Executive in Northern Ireland, as he will appreciate.  <\/p><p>  Returning to more of the formalised higher education co-operation issues, I echo the message that we should not have a narrow focus on who is doing better in terms of student flows and the implications that would arise from that, and Deputy Brendan Smith appealed that this be avoided.  That is something we need to take note of but the medium to long-term solution lies in a rising tide in terms of student flows on the island.  This feeds into the opportunities for specialisation.  As the world gets more complicated, education and training needs to become complicated to keep up.  Similarly, if research becomes more specialised and concentrated, there is a need for institutions, in turn, to focus their priorities.  If there is a much freer flow of people on the island, that allows opportunities for specialisation and we would all be winners from that outcome.  If we consider, for example, computer science and if we end up with one institution specialising in certain languages and another institution specialising in others, one can begin to see how we can all benefit from that.  Similarly around research, many of the competitive funds, particularly FP7, involve applications across jurisdictional boundaries.  Partnership between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on this will be vital.  Both of us will stand to benefit significantly from that outcome.<\/p><p>  Today's session has been very worthwhile.  It helps me to understand the nature of the issues and how all the members view them.  I certainly have a clear message that there is a desire for us to see much greater collaboration and discussion between the Ministers and officials in both jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>There will be mutually beneficial outcomes for us all if we get this right.  The committee has my commitment to continue exploring these issues and intensify that process in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013071100007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373543400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>We appreciate the Minister being here but we also value his insight and acknowledge his willingness to co-operate.

The natural university for many secondary schools in Donegal is the University of Ulster, be it at Coleraine, Magee, Jordanstown or Belfast.  I know Mr. Doherty wants to speak on this point also but it is important to acknowledge the role played by those colleges.  Their doors were always open during the Troubles and other difficult periods, and they were a natural home for many students along the Border.

It is a product of the relative lack of capacity in the County Donegal area that is driving that.

In the past in Northern Ireland we paid the registration fee for our students from the South, which on the surface appeared to be a good deal.  However, maintenance support was not available, and therefore, while they got in the door, they were on their own in terms of surviving in other areas.  That may have created a disincentive.  They can now take out a tuition fee loan to pay that fee but, in turn, we have put in place a more generous support package in terms of maintenance.  It is hoped that will start filtering through.
