He is in Members' prayers in a difficult task.  Pope Francis is a humble man who avoids the luxuries other cardinals would embrace.  He takes the bus to work, visits the slums, prays with the poor and has chastised those in his flock who refused to baptise the children of unmarried mothers, which shows his true humanity.  He became a cardinal when Argentina was going through an economic crisis and he has derided and lambasted unrestrained capitalism.  His courage can be seen from the time when the military junta was in force in Argentina.  He interceded directly by persuading a fellow priest who would say mass for the dictators to step aside in order that he could say the mass and intervene directly, which resulted in the saving of the lives of two priests.  He has taken the name of St. Francis, obviously intentionally, because of the great respect St. Francis had for humanity in terms of challenging authority.  The church at the time was riddled with corruption and he also challenged corruption.  In his ministry, St. Francis was given his task with the words, \"Go repair my house which, as you see, is falling completely to ruin\".  I am sure the new Pope Francis perceives the enormous challenges he faces and he is in Members' prayers for his enormous work.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il intends to move an amendment to the Order of Business and I ask the Leader to bring into the House the Minister for Finance in respect of the mortgage crisis and yesterday's Government announcement on what it is talking about doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400002#A00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Senator was going so well for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400002#A00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Can we have Senator Daly, the acting Leader of the Opposition, without interruption?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400002#A00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is nice to have one's learned colleague interrupting.

What we saw yesterday is that the Central Bank is, in effect, giving the banks a charter to evict people.  It is amazing how language is used by governments.  In war, governments talk about collateral damage.  They do not talk about deaths or killing.  In a financial crisis or mortgage crisis, they talk about people who will have their homes repossessed.  They do not talk about evictions.  That is, in effect, what the Government is allowing the banks to do.  They talk in percentages, for example, 12% of people are in arrears.  That is approximately 95,000 people who are in arrears for 90 days or more.  Approximately 50,000 homeowners, people with mortgages, are in arrears of up to 90 days.

The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has welcomed that.  Commissioner Karel De Gucht will be in charge of the negotiations from the European side.  A deal would be worth \u20ac86 billion to the European economy.  In his State of the Union address, President Obama has also referred to the importance of a deal to him.

I share the happiness of my Roman Catholic friends at this extraordinary event.  I stated a few days ago that the Holy Spirit would need to be very alert to find somebody among the current collection of cardinals, all of whom were nominated by the previous two Popes.  However, the Holy Spirit seems to have done so.  The moment Pope Francis came out on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica something happened.  One could tell this even before he opened his mouth.  His demeanour immediately reminded me of the last truly great Pope, John XXIII.  I think there is something of Pope John XXIII about this man, for example, his simplicity of dress.  I noticed that when one of his assistants tried to put the stole back on him he pushed it away.  He also uses public transport and visited people in the slums.  As the greatest leader of all the Christian churches, he showed humility when he knelt down and the silence that subsequently spread through the crowd was very impressive as it is almost impossible to get silence among such an enormous group of people.  He commanded such respect and I believe he will continue to do so.  He also asked for prayers and certainly has mine.<\/p><p>I did not sign the motion requesting the previous Pope, who is now known as Pope Emeritus, to visit Ireland but I would gladly sign a similar motion for this Pope.  I know he is against gay marriage but we forget sometimes what extraordinary progress we have made in certain areas and how uncomfortable it is for people of a certain age to have to deal with these dramatic changes.  I believe he is a man who will learn and he has indicated dialogue is taking place and he has opened dialogue, not only with his flock in Rome but with people all over the world.  One sign of this was the wonderful and refreshing sound of the so-called dissident priests singing like 24 blackbirds baked in a pie on the airwaves today.<\/p><p>While the Pope may be against gay marriage, he visited hospitals in Buenos Aires at a very difficult time and embraced, kissed and washed the feet of 12 AIDS patients.  There is a simple beauty in that gesture.  He chose the name &quot;Francis&quot; after Francis of Assisi who disagreed with the Pope when he declared that irrespective of what the Pope said, animals had souls.  There is something wonderful about St. Francis.  When I was involved in the running of the Hirschfeld centre, the gay community centre which had facilities including a cinema and restaurant, the most popular film was &quot;Brother Son, Sister Moon&quot;, which is about St. Francis of Assisi.  Among the wounded people of the gay community who have been regularly sprayed with acid from the Vatican at Christmas in recent years, the election of Pope Francis means a new beginning for all of us.  This man has given hope to a world that badly needs it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400004#C00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1363257600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I support a call made in the other House by Deputy Willie Penrose that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government impose an immediate moratorium on all planning or development of further wind farms until such time as the Government and Department conclude the review into the guidelines for the development of these massive wind farms.  Proposals have been made for 2,500 giant turbines across large tranches of the midlands.  I commend the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State at this Department, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on initiating a review of the guidelines because the current guidelines are out of date, ineffective and obsolete.<\/p><p>This is a national, rather than local issue, which is of concern in many counties, including Galway, Clare, Westmeath, Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  There is a view, which is not without foundation, among the communities concerned that big wind, if one likes, has the ear of government and that the Government is acting to some extent as a front of house salesperson promoting the interests of commercial wind farms.  This approach is dangerous and wrong.  The community and national interest must be embedded in policy.  I call on the Government to step back from what appears in some quarters to be a cosy relationship with elements of the private companies that are promoting massive wind farms.  There are genuine concerns about the scale, social impact and sustainability of existing developments as well as the setback requirements.  The idea of proper and meaningful consultation is a farce given that the wind companies are doing secret deals with landowners behind the backs of their neighbours and no one knows precisely what is happening.  Wind farm promoters state they will connect to the national grid by underground means, whereas EirGrid maintains that undergrounding is not feasible or possible.

I hope he will be successful in his position and we will see a more open and tolerant church under his reign.  Some of the events in this country yesterday would remind one of Roman times. <\/p> <p>I am thinking of the Colosseum, which I visited recently, and that yesterday's proposal on mortgages is almost akin to throwing innocent mortgage holders to the banking lions, with the Government just watching the whole process.  As said previously, there are 195,000 mortgage holders in distress.  We have been waiting for a long time for action from the Government on the issue.  The previous Government was also very slow to act.  It received two expert group reports and did nothing to alleviate the plight of mortgage holders.  The members of that Government are now jumping up and down looking for support for people in distress.  The current Government is giving more power to the banks and giving them the ability to hassle people in arrears and to move people off tracker mortgages.  It is opening the door for repossessions.  This is an awful day for mortgage holders and a terrible indictment of the Government.<\/p><p>We should have been hearing about a non-judicial, independent mortgage resolution body with power to impose resolution agreements on lenders and borrowers.  This body should have had a full range of solutions available to it, including debt write-down.  The first priority should have been to protect the family home by restructuring mortgages in a way that makes them sustainable in the longer term.  However, we have seen that the power has been handed over to the banks.  The banks are in the driving seat once more.  The big lobby has won over and it is an absolute disgrace on the part of the Government.  I call on the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible so we can debate the so-called resolution mechanism that has been proposed.  It is an absolute disgrace attributable to the Government and the people who support it, in addition to the banking system, which is obviously pushing very hard to mind its own vested interests.  It is a very bad day for citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400004#C00700","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363258200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in welcoming the election of the new pontiff.

The election last night of a new pontiff will, I hope, bring about a great a spirit of renewal, not only in the church but also in broader society.  In the short time since the Pope's election, what we have learned about his thinking on social policy, respect and concern for the poor and underprivileged is not just a religious message.  It is also very much a political message.   I hope many lessons can be learned by governments all over the world.  We must wish the new Pope well in the enormous task he is taking on.

Added to the celebration on this occasion is the elevation of our new Pope, Francis.  It is interesting that when all the world leaders send congratulations to the new Pope, they all know the role that the church has played in peacemaking, health, education and the relief of poverty.  This is a great story, to which Ireland has been central from the time that the Pope sent St. Patrick here.  We should rejoice in that as it is particularly important.  We should avail of this opportunity to give a tangible expression to the history of the relationship between Ireland the Vatican.  When world leaders are sending expressions of congratulation, would it not be wonderful if we in Ireland availed of the opportunity to do some bridge building and reopened the embassy at the Vatican?

In recent weeks in my county, we saw that a couple had to leave their home because of the noise of wind turbines next door.

Next June, in this city, there will be another conference packed with people in favour of wind energy who make many millions of euro out of it.  They will invite the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and spin it to them that wind energy is the way forward.  The people who are affected have no voice.

Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa has worded my point very well.  The election of Pope Francis represents a new beginning.  We have heard words today from everybody and there is a sense of hope.  This has been brought about by the demeanour and sympathetic manner of the new Pope.  He showed this when he was elected yesterday.  It gives us a chance of a new beginning.  Therefore, I support entirely what Senator Labhr\u00e1s \u00d3 Murch\u00fa said.  This is our opportunity to reopen the embassy in the Vatican.  It is exactly the time we should do so.  We should show our response to what Pope Francis has done.<\/p> <p>Comments were made last night about the age of Pope Francis and it was suggested that he might be a little too old.  I discovered, however, that he was born 20 days after me, so any suggestion that he is a little too old is being rejected entirely by me and I hope by others as well.  There is a lot of life left in that old dog yet and in this one too.  In the context of discussions about age, I draw the attention of the House to figures published yesterday which indicate that the life expectancy for males in Ireland is shorter than in a number of other European countries.  Life expectancy for males here is 77 but it is beyond 79 in at least seven other European countries, including Iceland, Italy, Sweden, Malta and Switzerland, among others.  These figures were published by the World Health Organisation and represent a challenge for our Department of Health.  When I came into this House first there was a huge number of road deaths every year but the country grabbed hold of that problem.  Various Ministers rose to the challenge and as a nation we decided we would do something about it.  That required a change of attitude and behaviour and the number of road deaths has reduced dramatically as a result.  We must now set a challenge for ourselves <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>life expectancy in Ireland, particularly for males.

When I saw his demeanour last night and heard his opening remarks, it struck me that he was a Christ-like figure.  He is a man who came from very humble origins, renounced the trappings of power and mixed with the poor.  I understand he advised friends last night not to travel to Rome to celebrate but to give the cost of such travel to the poor.  He has set the agenda for a very reforming and progressive papacy.   I join with my colleagues this morning in wishing him well and in welcoming his appointment.  I was a little concerned about the fact that he is 76 years of age but, like Senator Quinn, he has much to contribute.  He might be well advised to read some of Senator Quinn's publications, which could set him on the right road.  His is an inspired appointment and I look forward to him reforming the church.  In a way he is taking on a challenge similar to that faced by many governments around the world.  He is faced with rescuing the church from the difficulties of recent years, the scandals, financial irregularities, the fall in membership and the loss of confidence among the faithful.  The initial response to his appointment has been overwhelmingly positive throughout the world and hopefully the new Pope will build on that.<\/p><p>This weekend represents a fantastic opportunity for Ireland to sell itself around the world and I wish various Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste well in their travels to publicise and promote our country.

However, I am sorry to have to rain on that parade but I must again ask for a debate on the mortgage issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the wake of yesterday's announcement. I had great hope preceding that announcement but it could not have been any worse, as far as I am concerned.  It puts the banks completely in control.  When I was on the other side of the House previously, as well as on this side, I listened to people in serious mortgage difficulty who genuinely felt the banks have a virtual seat at the Cabinet table.  The only thing left for the Government to do at this stage is to formally appoint a bank representative to the Cabinet.  Far from extending assistance to struggling families throughout the country, the announcement yesterday strips out what little protection people have at the moment.  The Government is giving additional powers to the banks to contact people and is abolishing the limits that were put in place to curb harassment.  The code of conduct as we know will be thrown out.  While there are targets set in terms of the banks putting proposals to borrowers, there are no targets for them in terms of agreeing new arrangements with punters who are in mortgage difficulty.  We have seen no more than superficial engagement on the part of the banks to date, with only a token number of split mortgages agreed.  I am extremely saddened by the announcement yesterday, which puts the fox in charge of the henhouse in a way that will squeeze people.  The financial regulator, Mr. Elderfield admitted that we are likely to see an avalanche of repossessions now, which is regrettable.  The Government is putting the people last.  It is important that this is acknowledged today and that this message is not lost among the words of congratulations for the new Pope.  It is a sad day for borrowers in Ireland and I hope the Leader will agree to bring the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss this.  We need to see real measures and tangible help for those who are struggling to keep their homes.  Yesterday's announcement, I am afraid, puts the banks in absolute control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400006#E00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1363258800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I also welcome the election of the new Pope and wish him well in his future years.

A member of my family is working in a school with a pupil teacher ratio of one to 70 but still that school can provide a full meal to each pupil every day.  There are four schools feeding 4,000 children every day as a direct result of the work of the Catholic Church.  The selection of a Pope from outside Europe is a welcome development.  It will add to the growth of the church in developing countries and will see a refocus in Europe in terms of the role of the church.<\/p><p>I wish to move on to the issue of banking debt.  I am concerned by the alarmist comments of some of my colleagues on the other side of the House and by their suggestions that people will be driven to suicide.  Comments like that are unhelpful and may lead to people focusing on the possibility of suicide.  It is outrageous that such comments be made in this House.  The Government is approaching this issue in a very balanced way.  I remind Senators on the other side of the House that yesterday there was a public offering on 10-year debt for Ireland.  We were looking for \u20ac3 billion to be invested but got an offer of \u20ac12 billion.  The Government decided to take \u20ac5 billion at 4.15%, which is 75% lower than the rate that was offered to Ireland when Fianna F\u00e1il was in power.  I urge members of the Opposition not to forget that.  Their alarmist comments this morning are outrageous.  This Government has brought stability to the country and the proof of that lies in the success of the public offering yesterday. More than 400 investors offered to invest in Ireland.  When Fianna F\u00e1il was in power, fewer than 20 would offer money to be invested at any one time.  That is the stability this Minister for Finance has brought us.  I would love to have the Minister for Finance here to talk to Senators about all of the positive things that are happening, just in case they are not able to read the newspapers themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400006#E00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1363258800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We must deal with the negative issues too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400006#E00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1363258800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Does Senator Burke have a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400006#E00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1363258800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>There is plenty of positive news, on which we must focus.

Everybody is very positive towards this man, who appears to be extremely humble and who has a very difficult job ahead of him.<\/p><p>I wish to raise symphysiotomy again.

Let us hope the Vatican, the Catholic Church and the world will prosper as a result of the new Pope's election.<\/p> <p> There are other more mundane matters but they are also important.  Mortgage arrears were mentioned by Senators Daly, MacSharry, \u00d3 Clochartaigh and others.  I have stated on numerous occasions that the Government acknowledges that the mortgage arrears issue is one of the most serious social and economic matters facing the country.  It is a cause of distress for many families and an impediment to economic recovery.  The Government has prioritised the issue by implementing new legislation, structures and processes to resolve mortgage arrears.  The banks must now step up their engagement with borrowers in difficulty to allow these people to see a better future, which is what we all want.<\/p><p>There are now specific time-bound targets for the six main banks, which will ensure measurable progress in dealing with the issue.  By the end of July, the banks should propose sustainable mortgage solutions for 20% of distressed borrowers, reaching 30% by the end of September and 50% by the end of 2013.  The vast majority of distressed borrowers will see solutions proposed by the end of 2014, so there is progress on the issue.<\/p><p>It is nonsense to say that this is a charter for bankers.

It is up to the EU's economic council of trade Ministers, currently chaired by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to reach an agreed position on the new free trade investment partnership.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is holding a meeting for the EU trade Ministers in Dublin in April to achieve this agreement.

I simply did not have the time this week.  I was disappointed to learn I could not have it translated for me.  I ask the Minister of State to do something about the matter.  I am embarrassed to have to speak in English about the Irish language.  I am afraid that if I tried to speak in Irish, I would come out with Italian, French or German.  I am an honours graduate who spoke very good Irish in school and spent a great deal of time in the Gaeltacht.  I have spent a great deal of time in Europe in more recent years.  Whenever I try to speak Irish, I am inclined to come out with Italian because I have a degree in that language.  Those are my own problems.  I thought I would mention them on the record.  Perhaps I should spend a few weeks in the Gaeltacht when time allows to try to improve my Irish.  I would be proud to speak Irish.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his work.  I welcome this timely discussion on the Strait\u00e9is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030.  Seachtain na Gaeilge is a good time to assess where we are at with regard to the strategy.  I note with interest that an Irish language programme is being created for garda\u00ed.  We have heard about that in recent days.  I was also interested to hear the recent comments of the Irish language commissioner, who claims that this country's Irish language policy is in crisis.  A report recently commissioned by his office notes a 5% increase in complaints about problems dealing with State services through the medium of Irish.  Some 734 new complaints were made in the year covered by the report.  The 5% increase I have mentioned equates to an additional 37 complaints by comparison with the previous year.  When one considers the relative ease with which communication is conducted and complaints are received nowadays, this is hardly a foundation on which to describe something as a crisis.  My office receives approximately 30% more correspondence than it did a year ago.  This sort of inflammatory language does nothing to help us to draw up a calm and well thought-out policy in this area.<\/p><p>  Much of the report and much of what Mr. \u00d3 Cuirre\u00e1in says is borne of a defensiveness that has no place in a debate that is taking place at a time when we are cutting spending across the board.  We are attempting to decrease our spending by another &#8364;8 billion.  We are trying to decrease costs while keeping services intact.  Beyond this, there is a need to focus on the positive, for example by focusing on the Gaelscoileanna movement, which was discussed in this House during our last debate on the Irish language.  Gaelscoileanna are continuing to thrive in Ireland, as evidenced by the increase of 13% in the number of children attending such schools.  Across the country, sentiment with regard to the idea of Gaelscoileanna is continuing to rise.  We must also look to the Irish language arts, which are continuing to thrive in a challenging environment, as the arts always do.<\/p> <p>We must continue to encourage the next generation to embrace the language and to find it a useful conversational tool.  I should include my generation in this also.  This is a challenge that has eluded us for a number of generations, but the Minister of State has grasped it.<\/p><p>As we know, this 20-year strategy for the Irish language is built on the foundation of the constitutional status of the language and follows on the Government statement on the Irish language published in December 2006.  Things have changed utterly since then, yet we are doing everything possible to uphold the strategy and to ensure the Irish language prospers between now and 2030.  That statement set out 13 policy objectives to that end.  In objective 1, the special status given to the Irish language in the Constitution and in legislation, such as the Official Languages Act 2003, the Education Act 1998, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Broadcasting Act 2001, will be upheld.  This is being done.  <\/p><p>Objective 2 states that the Official Languages Act will be fully implemented.  Despite recent breaches, ongoing efforts are being made to fulfil this objective.  Objective 3 states that the Irish language community, inside and outside the Gaeltacht, will be encouraged and supported to transmit the Irish language to the next generation as a living household language.  As we have seen recently, the Minister has undertaken significant measures in this regard.  Objective 4 provides for the Gaeltacht to be given special support as an Irish-speaking area.  Objective 5 provides that Irish will be taught as an obligatory subject from primary to leaving certificate level.  The curriculum will foster oral and written competence in Irish among students and an understanding of its value to us as a people.  This is ongoing.<\/p><p>Objective 6 states that a high standard of all-Irish education will be provided to school students whose parents or guardians so wish.  Gaelscoileanna will continue to be supported at primary level and all-Irish provision at post-primary level will be developed to meet demand.  Despite challenges on resources, our school building programme continues undiminished, underlining the investment we are undertaking in our future, highlighting that for the Government, education is a priority.  We endeavour to uphold this objective.<\/p><p>Objective 7 has proven challenging, given the current circumstances.  It states that Irish language preschool education will continue to be supported and third level education through Irish will be further developed.  Objective 8 states that the State will continue to support Foras na Gaeilge in the context of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  Objective 9 sets out that high quality broadcast services through the medium of Irish will be ensured, particularly through the continuous development of RTE - I note Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa's comments in this regard - Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta and TG4.  Our investment in this area has continued and will continue for the lifetime of the Government.  The Minister of State may want to look into this further, particularly with regard to RTE.<\/p><p>Objective 10 states that every support will be given to the European Union in implementing the decision to make Irish a working and official language of the Union from 1 January 2007.  This has happened.  Objective 11 adds that in order to promote Irish nationally and to preserve and strengthen it in the Gaeltacht, the work being done by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and by agencies and bodies under it will be reinforced.  This is a vague objective and needs to be tightened up if we are to have any idea of how to measure its success.<\/p><p>Objective 12 relates to the use of the Irish language by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments with regard to the recent revelation indicating An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na was found to be among the bodies at fault in this regard.  An investigation found that eight out of nine garda\u00ed assigned to servicing Gaoth Dobhair in the Donegal Gaeltacht were unable to carry out their duties through Irish.  As a result, an Irish language programme is being created for garda\u00ed in Gaeltacht areas.<\/p><p>While we face challenges in meeting the 13 objectives, the challenging environment must be acknowledged.  We must also acknowledge the committed effort of the Minister of State to navigate a difficult terrain in terms of funding.  While I believe we are on course to meet many of the 13 objectives, we should look at correcting our course now and at amending some of these objectives to make them more practical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400012#L00600","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363263000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 tr\u00ed ruda\u00ed le r\u00e1 agam ar dt\u00fas.

The hacks, whom I loathe and despise, uniquely and severally, did one lovely thing for me then, they awarded me a tied first place in that debate with Michael D. Higgins.  It came as such a surprise to them that a the little Protestant fairy from Col\u00e1iste na Trion\u00f3ide could waltz in and speak Irish, even haltingly.  Trinity College has a glorious record in that regard, going back as far as the great Bishop Bedell who translated the Book of Common Prayer into Irish, and Queen Elizabeth provided the first Irish print font there.<\/p><p>The final thing I will say - This is a secret and not many people know it.  I probably should not even say it - is that a number of my colleagues in the presidential race, not the current President who is very fluent in Irish, had no Irish at all.

T\u00e1 br\u00f3n orm nach mbeidh m\u00e9 ag caint i nGaeilge.  I really wish I could and I feel embarrassed that I cannot.<\/p><p>I would like to take up a point raised by Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa about the importance of Irish and how we all studied it.  I studied Irish and loved it.  It was one of my favourite subjects from the age of four until I left school.<\/p><\/a> <p>I felt that I left school with a high level of competency in Irish but since then I have not spoken it publicly because of a lack of confidence.  I know the Irish department here offers excellent services throughout the Oireachtas and it is something I intend to follow up.  It is such a beautiful language and I commend Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh for the Irish he uses every morning on the Order of Business.  I have a problem translating it, I admit, but I envy his dialect and pronunciation.<\/p><p>The main objectives of the 20-year plan are to increase the number of daily Irish speakers outside the education system from 83,000 to 250,000, to increase the number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht by 25% and to increase the number of people who use State services through Irish and who can access television radio and print media through the language.  I welcome the fact that under the Gaeltacht Act 2012, the Gaeltacht will in future be based on linguistic criteria instead of the geographic areas, which had been the position to date.  When I first read this, as someone who had travelled to the Gaeltacht often, I could see the logic behind it.  It will further safeguard the areas where 66% of the population are daily Irish speakers and increase the concentration of Irish speakers in the area.  In places outside the Gaeltacht, statutory provisions are being drawn up for Irish language networks.  There will be a particular focus on urban areas where there is already a support system in place for progressive plans for the language within schools, communities and a concentration of population, as well as State support.<\/p><p>This will bring a wonderful opportunity to towns like Dundalk, that has a vibrant and enthusiastic Irish speaking community and a strong link to the Gaeltacht region of Rann na Feirste in Donegal.  I sent all of my children to Rann na Feirste and they have built up a huge love of Irish, with one of them now studying Irish at third level because of that love and her experience of speaking Irish all the time in Rann na Feirste.  That has had an influence on the whole family.  I sent them to the Gaeltacht because I never got the opportunity to study there but I recognise the importance of acquiring a second language at a young age, which is crucial in a child's education.  I agree with Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa's remarks that if we could all speak French half as well as we speak Irish, we would definitely say we are fluent in that language.  We all have some Irish to an extent.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact a language plan will be drafted for every Gaeltacht.  This shows the Government's dedication to the strait\u00e9is 20 bliain.  This move is an acknowledgement of the decline of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht and a realistic approach to finding a solution.  These language plans, once approved, will be monitored, reviewed and observed by the Department to ensure the highest uptake of the language in each area.<\/p><p>I particularly welcome the family language support programme to support parents from the Gaeltacht who are raising their children through Irish, or Irish speakers who wish to raise their children through Irish inside and outside the Gaeltacht.  If this programme is continually supported, it will give rise to a new generation of bilingual speakers who will be better able to communicate with their peers, have a deeper sense of self, not to mention the academic benefits that are associated with the introduction of a second language in the early years of a child's life.  I welcome the fact Dundalk's first me\u00e1nscoil will open in September, Col\u00e1iste L\u00fa, which will be run by County Louth VEC.  Having spoken to Dr. P\u00e1draig Kirk, the CEO of Louth VEC, I know there has been a fantastic uptake on enrolment, not only for this September, but for future years.  That is wonderful to see.  Recently the school held its open day, which was a huge celebration for Irish.  This is a completely new venture for Dundalk and County Louth and I welcome it wholeheartedly.<\/p><p>We are still very much in the establishment years of this strategy but there is an enthusiasm and energy for the Irish language.  Organisations such as Foras na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge are firm pillars of support in the promotion of Irish in an academic and a social context.  Before I was a Senator, I was a music teacher.  I had a great love of teaching traditional Irish music in my spare time.  I was very involved with Sl\u00f3gadh and competitions run by Gael Linn.  That was the only time I used my Irish after leaving school because it was a great opportunity for all of us.  Perhaps we could revive Sl\u00f3gadh.  I know there are many similar competitions but within the school setting it was a brilliant way to get through.  This was before cooperation between different subject areas and it gave a great opportunity for the Irish department and music department in the school to come together.  Sometimes we entered larger competitions and sometimes we composed and went to agallaimh and cabarets.  It was a lovely way to encourage students to speak Irish.<\/p><p>Both 2012 and 2013 have seen great progress in the field terminology of Irish.  With the publication of the revised Caighde\u00e1n Oifigi\u00fail in 2012, and An Focl\u00f3ir Nua English-Irish dictionary, which went live online at the beginning of the year.  These advances in the terminology of Irish will ensure the future of the language as the work means the language will remain as contemporary as possible and will be better able to serve its speakers.<\/p><p>The demand for education through Irish is increasing year on year and has expanded from primary and secondary school education into third level courses that are now being provided through Irish by Fiontar in DCU and Acadamh in NUIG.  My own daughter obtained her degree through Fiontar in DCU, an excellent course.  It is fantastic to see so many students there and she is now pursuing further studies in l\u00e9ann teanga in Acadamh in NUIG.  The Irish language comes to her so naturally that when I speak to her on the phone, she will start to speak Irish and I have to tell her that I had no idea what she had said and she will reply that she does not know the English for what she is saying.  That sense of belonging and pride is wonderful.<\/p><p>The course that was developed this year to meet the increasing demand for skilled Irish speakers who are highly trained in the language to act as translators and interpreters shows the importance, respect and status enjoyed by Irish in recent years.  This status is recognised and supported by the 20 year strategy and will be nurtured throughout the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400013#M00700","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363263600,"counter":120,"content":"<\/a> <p>T\u00e1 f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it.

Recently, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, visited Schull where the first phase of the planned Schull Community Hospital has been more or less completed.  I have put in a lot of political effort on this issue over the years as it is a project that has moved very slowly.  Many years ago, I brought a delegation to Dublin, a minibus load of mainly elderly people, including one woman was in her 80s, to meet the then Minister, Brian Cowen, who likened his brief at the time to being like dealing with Angola.<\/p><p>Phase 1 of this project is almost complete and fantastic work is being done in this little community hospital which serves the Mizen Head peninsula, an area close to that represented by the Minister of State's former colleague, P. J. Sheehan, who was in the Oireachtas for many years.  He was a political adversary of mine, but was also a friend.  He will be 80 on L\u00e1 le P\u00e1draig and I wish him well and wish him health in his retirement.  With regard to phases two and three of this project, the people want to know when it is likely work on these will commence and when is it expected they will be completed?  Is the money available for this project?<\/p><p>Statistics indicate that there is a high number of elderly on the Mizen Head peninsula, just like in other remote areas.  The age profile in these areas is older and there are more people over the age of 65 or 70 than there are young people in their teens and 20s.  I hope the Minister of State, will in the week that is in it have an abundance of good news for me on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400019#S02000","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1363266600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>N\u00ed seachtain na Nollag \u00ed seo.  Seo seachtain Fh\u00e9ile Ph\u00e1draig.<\/p><p>I thank Senator O'Donovan for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on the matter.  As the Senator is aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme.  In 2012, with a budget of almost \u20ac1 billion, financial support was provided to over 22,000 people in nursing homes.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Schull Community Hospital in Cork.<\/p><p>Schull Community Hospital is located in the Mizen peninsula which, as the Senator will be aware, has a higher than average number of older people per head of population.  It is expected that the demand for beds at the hospital will continue to grow.  The hospital, registered with HIQA for a period of three years, with effect from 25 June 2012, provides 21 residential, respite, convalescent and palliative care beds.  A plan has been developed to bring the hospital to full compliance with HIQA standards.  This is set out in three phases, with an estimated total cost of \u20ac2.5 million.  Phase 1, with an investment of \u20ac1.3 million was completed last month.  The contract provided for new accommodation for 14 residents and refurbished accommodation for seven residents.<\/p> <p>In addition, the completed works ensured the hospital achieved a certificate of fire compliance.  The Health Service Executive was the main funder of this development, with the Friends of Schull Community Hospital contributing towards fit-out and decoration.<\/p><p>Current constraints on public sector staffing and recruitment, the ongoing need to meet service and safety standards and severe financial constraints pose challenges for community nursing units.  My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive to develop an overall plan which will seek to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available.  The estates department of the HSE is undertaking a review of all facilities to establish their state of readiness for the registration requirements of the Health Information and Quality Authority after 2015.  Plans will be reviewed and prioritised taking into account staffing available, the demand for services and provision in the area, the extent of works required and available capital funding.  Phases 2 and 3 at Schull will be considered in this context.  However, owing to the works carried out to date, Schull Community Hospital is well positioned, with much less work required, to secure registration after 2015.<\/p><p>Every effort will be made to ensure the highest standards of care will continue to be provided for all residents in a safe and secure environment and we meet the needs of those who need our services in the best way possible.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400019#S02100","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363267200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, although I am not as reassured by it as I would like to be.  In any case, I understand he delivered the statement on behalf of his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I note, as did the Minister of State, the tremendous work the Friends of Schull Community Hospital has done during the years.  Its members have engaged in collections and other fund-raising efforts and stated it will redouble its efforts to raise funds in the locality if a positive indication is given that phases 2 and 3 of the hospital will be completed in the next couple of years.  I understand the group has raised in the region of \u20ac400,000 and that its members are prepared to go back onto the streets of the small village of Schull to raise further funds.  The population of the village swells in the summer months as a result of its sailing and yachting facilities, but it is a small community which is doing tremendous work.  Its fund-raising achievements are second to none and the community will redouble its efforts if it sees light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013031400020#T00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1363267200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator again that its advocacy will be brought to the attention of the Minister of State and the Health Service Executive and taken into account in further decisions related to the project in Schull.
