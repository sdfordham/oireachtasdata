The Capital Review is being finalised at the moment and will be published before the end of the year. It will set out a multi-annual capital investment framework to the end of the decade, including the 3 year ceilings announced in the Budget.<\/p><p>  The Deputy has asked specifically about the potential for using development bonds to fund national infrastructure.\u00a0The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) indicates that project-specific bonds would not be the most effective way forward.\u00a0However, the Government has been actively exploring other non-traditional approaches to\u00a0financing capital projects that could be viable, and we have been able to make some notable announcements recently.\u00a0In this context, on Budget Day I announced that it is intended that &euro;400m of public investment would be available, including from the proceeds of the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is energy business,\u00a0for\u00a0investment in social housing through an off-balance sheet financial vehicle which will channel funds to the voluntary housing sector.\u00a0I also announced that Public Private Partnerships would be used to deliver 1,500\u00a0social housing units by 2017.\u00a0Both of these are in addition to the significant direct Exchequer investment in the social housing programme over the next three years, and the appropriate use of non-traditional funding approaches such as these can help us increase the level of investment available beyond what we can provide through normal Exchequer voted spending.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that we are setting up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. The ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise\u00a0the resources transferred from the NPRF\u00a0by attracting third-party co-investment.

Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure based on cost estimates and submissions made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG). This funding is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities. The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.<\/p><p>  In addition to the &euro;19.6m funding for local authorities, an amount of &euro;1.2m was also allocated under the Government Decision for repair of damage to OPW's own coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Based on the programmes of works for repairs to coastal protection infrastructure that were submitted by local authorities, total funding of &euro;19.0 million was approved by the OPW for 176 projects that were deemed to be within the scope of the works covered by the Government Decision.  In this regard I would point out that the Government Decision did not allocate funding for strengthening or new coastal protection works. It applied to repairs of existing infrastructure only. <\/p><p>  The prioritisation and progression of the repair works is entirely a matter for the local authorities. The progress made by local authorities in carrying out the repairs has varied from county to county depending on the particular circumstances prevailing and the scale and nature of the damage to be repaired in that area.  Overall however, I am generally satisfied that the Councils have gone about the repair work in an efficient manner and I encourage them to continue to progress the works as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the OPW has made excellent progress on the repair of damage to the flood defence infrastructure, mainly embankments, for which it is directly responsible and that most of the required repair work has now been completed.<\/p><p>  The question of improving flood defences through significant strengthening or upgrading of existing defences or new works  is a separate issue to the programmes of repair works for which specific funding was allocated by the Government Decision.

This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime. <\/p><p>  The new EU rules comprise a suite of three Directives (Public Procurement, Utilities and Concessions) that repeal the existing rules governing the conduct of procurement across the EU but the basic architecture of EU procurement will remain intact. The changes in the new regime were agreed principally to streamline the public procurement process and to put in place more simplified and flexible rules to reduce red tape and to make the procurement process more efficient. <\/p><p>  While most of the rules are mandatory for Ireland and all other Member States to implement into national law, there is some limited policy latitude permitted to Member States in transposing the new regime into national legislation. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process. In this context, I launched on Friday last, 31st October, a public consultation on the new Directives.\u00a0 The document is available on the OGP website www.procurement.ie and written submissions are invited from stakeholders and interested parties on the issues raised in the consultation document by 12 December 2014.

They can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.\u00a0 In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties\u00a0at tender stage and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is fully\u00a0aware, the Government has recently supported in principle a Private Members Bill put forward by her Party in relation to social clauses.\u00a0\u00a0The Government is not opposed to the principle of social clauses and sees significant merit in developing a social clauses framework.\u00a0 We believe however that the inclusion of social clauses needs to be done in a targeted manner and not in the &quot;across the board manner&quot; suggested\u00a0by the Bill.\u00a0 The Government favours a targeted approach to the use of social clauses focussed on contracts where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.\u00a0 This is likely to mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I should point out that, as the Deputy is aware,\u00a0there are already a number of initiatives\u00a0under way in this area.<\/p><p>  A devolved schools programme is being administered by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.\u00a0 This involves\u00a0three contracts covering fourteen sites with the works comprising both stand-alone, new build and extensions\/refurbishment works.

While the fiscal emergency which arose through the mismanagement of the economy\u00a0by\u00a0the previous Government gave rise to the exceptional statutory reductions in pay imposed on public servants, the process of collective bargaining has survived and has been highlighted by the concluding of difficult public service agreements including most recently, the Haddington Road Agreement, by staff representatives and their public service employers.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In relation to the pay reductions imposed on public servants through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013, the reductions imposed have been progressive, thereby ensuring that reductions imposed\u00a0impacted on low paid workers\u00a0least and that higher reductions were imposed on the higher paid.\u00a0Significantly, the more recent\u00a0 pay cuts applied to public servants under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 and the Haddington Road Agreement apply only to those higher paid public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more.

The Directive also includes various permissible grounds for exclusion at the contracting authority's discretion, including bankruptcy, criminal conviction (where not attracting mandatory exclusion), grave professional misconduct, serious misrepresentation, and non-payment of tax or social security by the economic operator.\u00a0 These provisions been incorporated into Irish law under Regulation 53 of SI 329 and are reflected in the Model Tender and Contract Document which issued in 2011 and which cover the procurement of goods and general services.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>For works, goods and services contracts, these provisions are contained in the Instructions to Tenderers and conditions of contract, where the standard forms of contract are used.\u00a0 These latter documents also require that any conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, on the part of a tenderer, individual employees, or agents or subcontractors of a tenderer to be fully disclosed to the Contracting Authority as soon as it becomes apparent.\u00a0 This may result in elimination from a competition or termination of a contract.\u00a0The provisions also prohibit gifts, consideration or commission of any kind as an inducement or reward in relation to the award or performance of any public sector contract. <br\/><br\/>In relation to buyers, employees in the public sector\u00a0are\u00a0required to adhere to ethical standards under the relevant legislation including the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 - 2005.\u00a0 Public procurers involved in procurement are required, under these legislative instruments, to operate to the highest ethical standards in public office.\u00a0\u00a0These requirements comply fully with the existing rules governing public procurement.<br\/><br\/>The new public Directives are generally similar to the existing rules with respect to exclusion, although with some additions.\u00a0 For example the grounds for mandatory exclusion have been updated and expanded to include human trafficking, etc. Breach of tax or social security obligations by the economic operator, established by &quot;final and binding judicial or administrative finding&quot; is now to be a mandatory exclusion ground, rather than discretionary. The permissible \/ discretionary grounds for exclusion are also extended compared with the current rules, to cover cases where: an economic operator has entered agreements aimed at distorting competition.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The Office of Government Procurement\u00a0is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process.\u00a0 In this context, on Friday last, 31st October, I launched a public consultation on the new Directives.\u00a0 The document is available on the OGP website and written submissions are invited from stakeholders and interested parties on the issues raised in the consultation document by 12th December, 2014.\u00a0 Consideration will be given to the responses received when drafting the Statutory Instruments to implement the EU rules into national law.<br\/><br\/>On foot of responses received from the public consultation and ongoing discussions with the Attorney General's Office, consideration will be given to any further appropriate measures for contracting authorities to take to prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest arising in the conduct of the procurement process. Issues around prior involvement of candidate or tenderers within the meaning of article 41 of the new Directive will also be considered.<br\/><br\/>If the Deputy has any concerns or information regarding potential ethical breaches, I would encourage you to raise the matter with the relevant contracting authority or enforcement body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redundancies","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[42053\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has conducted an analysis of the costs and benefits of the voluntary redundancy scheme which operated in the public service in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":59,"content":"<p>As I have mentioned in previous replies on this matter, before\u00a0the Government decision was\u00a0taken in\u00a0\u00a0respect of introducing\u00a0Voluntary\u00a0Redundancy in the Public Service, an\u00a0analysis of the likely Exchequer impacts was\u00a0carried out\u00a0to estimate the cost of such a scheme, the payback period for the State and its overall\u00a0net present value. <\/p><p>  This analysis\u00a0\u00a0estimated that for every 1,000 employees who opted to participate in a Voluntary Redundancy programme there would be an estimated\u00a0gross cost of approximately &euro;109 million.\u00a0The gross payroll savings for 1,000 employees was estimated at approximately\u00a0&euro;57 million every year.\u00a0 Therefore the initial cost of 1,000 employees leaving\u00a0would be recouped within two years.\u00a0 The analysis also proposed that further savings would also\u00a0be realised in the future when these employees reached retirement age because of their reduced pension entitlements. <\/p><p>  In 2013, just under\u00a0500 staff\u00a0left the Public Service under a Voluntary Redundancy\u00a0scheme.\u00a0 This was largely in the Local Authority area (389), with small\u00a0pockets in the Defence, Education and Semi-State sectors.\u00a0\u00a0It would have been the responsibility of local sectoral management to\u00a0oversee the offer of these schemes, under the agreed standard terms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It\u00a0is important to note that:\u00a0<\/p><p>  - the\u00a0approach to Voluntary Redundancy schemes has been\u00a0to allow public service organisations to use it on a targeted basis in different areas\u00a0where it makes sense and can be shown to offer value for money in the long run; and that<\/p><p>  - Voluntary Redundancy is by definition not compulsory,\u00a0and therefore people will only leave if that is what they want; equally there is no automatic right to redundancy.\u00a0\u00a0All applications\u00a0are considered in the context of ongoing business needs and service provision priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[42023\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600053#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason his Department has given permission to the Office of Public Works to prefund projects of a capital nature arising from the storm damage last January when similar expenditure arising out of same storm damage approved by other Departments is not allowed to be prefunded under the rules laid down by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The Government Decision of 11th February 2014 allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for clean-up, repair and restoration works in relation to public infrastructure that was damaged in the period 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014. Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG). This funding for repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. <\/p><p>  The average number of claimants on the rent supplement scheme for 2014 to date in payment is approximately 76,200 with an average annualised cost to the State of &euro;4,450 representing &euro;344 million which has been provided for the scheme in 2014. <\/p><p>  Waterford, represents 2% of the total recipient base with approximately 1,400 tenancies currently in receipt of rent supplement.  At an average annual cost of &euro;3,000, total forecast rent supplement costs for Waterford will be in region of &euro;4.2 million. <\/p><p>  The scheme&rsquo;s cost per tenancy and related volume of recipients clearly suggests that the Department has a duty of care to ensure the legitimacy of tenancies presenting to the scheme. This includes not only verifying the existence of a tenancy, but the amount of rent required and an assessment of a person's means. <\/p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as confirmation of a Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) by the relevant Local Authority, where applicable; details of the applicant&rsquo;s income and bank statements; and verification of the tenancy arrangements.  Some aspects of the application process are inevitably time-consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  As outlined to the Deputy in response to parliamentary question 40164 on 21 October 2014, when the necessary information required to process an application is provided to the Department, a rent supplement claim will be processed within a short timeframe, approximately 5 to 10 days.<\/p><p>  In the first six months of 2014, a total of 488 applications for rent supplement were registered in Waterford.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. As of the end of October 2014, there are approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  <\/p><p>  Rent supplement is subject to a statutory maximum limit on the amount of rent that a recipient may incur and is based on the location of the residence and family composition. The scheme provides assistance with reasonable accommodation costs and does not provide access to all housing in all areas. The Department has a responsibility to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved for both the rent supplement recipient and the taxpayer. <\/p><p>  I am concerned that the impact of adjusting limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers, as necessary. In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations to support families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, some 180 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  The Department is currently examining the need for such protocols in other areas.  <\/p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and key to restoring stability to the rental market. In this context, it should be noted that the Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020. <\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government also announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years. In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes representing the first major investment in housing since 2009.

The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is in ongoing discussions with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place appropriate mechanisms to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964. In tandem with this he is also working to acquire the necessary skilled resources to enable applications to the ICF to be processed effectively and efficiently. Due to the unprecedented nature and scale of the Setanta insolvency\u00a0the Accountant is not yet in a position to provide a timetable for applications to be made to the Fund,\u00a0but it is hoped that applications by the Accountant to the High Court can begin sooner rather than later.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Setanta Liquidator is currently examining a range of factors\u00a0in order to estimate the cost of claims and the extent to which claims can be met\u00a0in the Setanta liquidation.\u00a0The most recent figures, which were provided to officials in my Department in July 2014, indicate that there were 2,004 open claims with Setanta. This number is expected to increase over the next two years until May 2016. The split\u00a0of\u00a0the number of\u00a0claims,\u00a0between first and third party claims was not provided to my Department. The net claims reserve (which indicates the amount at which it is expected that these claims will settle)\u00a0for these open claims at that time was &euro;34,977,453.\u00a0This was split &euro;1,173,769 for first party claims and &euro;33,803,684 for third party claims. The net claims reserve figure does not take into account claims which have been incurred but not reported which is likely to be a material number. The Liquidator has advised that\u00a0settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims. Based on current claims reserves the Liquidator has indicated to my Department that he does not expect to be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims. <\/p><p>  Current estimates indicate that the shortfall\u00a0for most\u00a0Setanta claimants will be relatively small once they have received\u00a0the 65% compensation\u00a0available from the ICF\u00a0as well as\u00a0their distribution from the Liquidation.

","asker":"1096","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>Tax legislation provides for a limit or ceiling on the total capital value of tax-relieved pension benefits that an individual can draw down in their lifetime from all of their supplementary pension arrangements. This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT and was introduced on 7 December 2005 and amended since (most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014).<\/p><p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold or PFT, may be claimed where the capital value of an individual s pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the dates of its reduction.<\/p><p>  The SFT regime was introduced and subsequently amended mainly to deal with the abuse of the tax-relief arrangements for pensions which resulted in pension overfunding by individuals and to place a constraint on the cost to the Exchequer of \u00a0tax relief for pension saving. The regime deals with these issues at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. There is, therefore, no restriction or limit on the contributions that an individual can make to his or her pension savings on an ongoing basis (other than the standard earnings and age-related percentage limits that determine the annual level of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by an individual). Instead, a significant tax charge is imposed on the value of retirement benefits above the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, when they are drawn down. In this way, the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of funding for benefits above those limits by clawing back, through the significant tax charge, the tax relief granted.<\/p><p>  Where an individual is a member of a pension scheme or arrangement on or after 7 December 2005 and the scheme or arrangement is or becomes subject to a pension adjustment order (PAO), then in calculating the capital value of any benefit drawn down at retirement from the pension scheme or arrangement (e.g. a pension, annuity, lump sum etc.) in respect of that individual for the purpose of establishing if their SFT or PFT has been exceeded, the benefits designated to a spouse or civil partner under the PAO are to be included in the calculation as if the PAO had not been made. Also, in calculating whether an entitlement to a \u00a0PFT arises in the first place, the individual includes the capital value of his\/her pension benefits as if the PAO had not been made. <\/p><p>  The PAO exclusion provision was introduced as an  anti-avoidance  measure, designed to prevent an individual with a PFT, whose pension was subject to a PAO, from taking the view that as part of his or her pension had been assigned to a spouse\/civil partner, he or she was then free to avail of further tax relief in building their part of the pension fund back up to the level of their PFT. If this had been permitted, it would have allowed a situation to arise whereby the aggregate amount of the pension funds built up originally with tax relief (in respect of which the PFT was granted) and then built back up again (with further tax relief) to the PFT amount, following the PAO, to greatly exceed the original amount of the PFT, at significant additional tax cost to the Exchequer.\u00a0 For these reasons, the legislation requires a PAO to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether an individual s SFT or PFT has been exceeded. The corollary of this is that the designated benefit going to the non-member spouse or partner is not included in determining the overall capital value of the non-member spouse or partner s supplementary pension benefits, if any, as to do so could result in  double taxation .\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In this year's Finance Bill, I am making provision that where, in cases involving PAOs, an individual's SFT or PFT is exceeded giving rise to an immediate tax charge on the excess at the higher income tax rate, that the tax charge is shared equitably between the former spouses or partners in relation to whom the PAO refers.<\/p><p>  As to the request for my views on the particular scenario outlined in the question under which it is apparently being suggested that the entire value of an individual s pension benefits (which happen to equate to the current level of the SFT) are designated to a former spouse or partner under a PAO, it would be difficult to make any meaningful comment on the tax relief aspects of the particular scenario in isolation. This is a highly complex matter and each case depends on its own circumstances. In cases of divorce or separation where pension adjustment orders have been made by the Court it is open to the parties to apply to court to have their pension adjustment orders varied if their circumstances change.\u00a0 It would be a matter for the courts to determine what would be appropriate in each case.<\/p><p>  It is important, however, to address an apparent assumption in the question which is not correct. The SFT is not a  &euro;2 million allowance  available to taxpayers, generally, or to a particular category of taxpayer, as is the case for example with the PAYE allowance to which PAYE taxpayers are entitled. The SFT has relevance and potential application only to individuals who are funding for or accruing pension benefits in pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners and who have relevant earnings out of which contributions to such arrangements are or are capable of being tax-relieved or tax subsidized. It has no direct application or relevance to individuals or taxpayers who are not in this position, including for example, the former spouses or partners of pension scheme members who are not in pension saving arrangements as described.\u00a0 Moreover, since the SFT operates as a limit or threshold at a relatively high value and only impacts when that threshold (or the higher PFT limit, if applicable) is exceeded, the funding for or accrual of pension benefits by the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements whether or not impacted by PAOs are and will continue to be unaffected by the SFT regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600057#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600057#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[42689\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600057#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional revenues that would accrue to the State if the higher rate of income tax was raised by 4%.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners have published\u00a0the Budget 2015 Ready Reckoner,\u00a0on their website's\u00a0statistics pages at .\u00a0The reckoner\u00a0shows a number of indicative changes to Income Tax rates.

There remain, however, annual deficit ceilings set out in the Excessive Deficit Procedure\u00a0which the Government must meet, and our fiscal policies are predicated on achieving these.  To date, the Government's approach to fiscal consolidation, comprising both tax and expenditure measures, has proven successful as we have achieved all targets.<\/p><p>  2015 represents the last year in which Ireland will be in an Excessive Deficit Procedure,\u00a0and Budget 2015 and the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015 to  2017 are designed to deliver a deficit of below 3% of GDP.  In the subsequent years, Ireland is committed to\u00a0managing its public finances\u00a0in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.<\/p><p>  Our task in achieving our fiscal targets has of course been assisted by the strong recovery under way in our economy.  The latest GDP data shows that output expanded by 7.7% in the year to Q2 2014, while unemployment, a key priority of this Government, continues to fall.  This has offered the Government a degree of flexibility in implementing fiscal policy as the latest Exchequer returns show that revenues from taxation are\u00a0almost &euro;1.1 billion ahead of\u00a0profile.<\/p><p>  This recovery has of course been aided by the fiscal policy objectives and reforms implemented by this Government.  A precondition for economic growth is prudent and sustainable management of the public finances.  Added to this, the economic growth-friendly environment and policies, as well as the significant public sector reforms undertaken, provide the foundations for sustained economic growth and prosperity for years to come.<\/p><p>  Aside from their contribution to economic growth, reforms to the way in which the public sector operates will provide Irish citizens with high-quality public services that are delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  The increased focus on evaluation of expenditure policies and programmes has also contributed to our ability to effectively manage and allocate resources across all areas of public policy.  For example, the forthcoming publication of the Capital Review will set out multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings for Departments, and identify those areas in which the Government must invest in order to promote future growth and resolve pressing social issues.<\/p><p>  With regard to expenditure management in 2014, my Department\u00a0regularly analyses expenditure trends across all areas of Voted expenditure.  As of end-October 2014, Gross Voted expenditure of &euro;44.2 billion was 0.9% ahead of profile, with\u00a0Health Group expenditure being 3.8% over profile.

The new Reform Plan is also\u00a0available\u00a0at <i>www.reformplan.per.gov.ie<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Taoiseach and I launched the Civil Service Renewal Plan.\u00a0\u00a0This ambitious plan incorporates a vision and a three year action plan to renew the\u00a0Civil Service.\u00a0 It delivers on a key Programme for Government commitment and represents a fundamental new vision and direction for the Civil Service. \u00a0The Plan outlines the practical changes that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service, providing a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Overall, I am satisfied that we have made very strong progress to date on the delivery of reform and that\u00a0we have also set out a clear and ambitious reform agenda for the Civil and Public Service over\u00a0the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600059#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":234,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 85 to 89, inclusive, answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600059#WRJ02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600059#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[42487\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600059#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if Irish Water is subject to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>Contracts for the supply of water would be considered to come within the scope of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980.<\/p><p>  As the economic regulator for public water services, the Commission for Energy Regulation is required by Part 5 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to have regard, among other things, to the need to ensure that the customers of Irish Water are provided with the quality of service provided for in a code of practice approved by the Commission.

Given that fact, it is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States.  At each Agriculture Council over the last year the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  I, and some other like-minded Ministers, consistently called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and this remains the case.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July, it was again discussed in October and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.<\/p><p>  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.  In this regard, I am organising a major dairy conference on November 19 next to assess our readiness for quota abolition and to take stock of the current challenges and opportunities facing the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600061#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Scheme Payments","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600061#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[42676\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600061#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":",further to Parliamentary Question No. 248 of 30 September 2014, if the additional costs associated with the preparation of a single commonage management plan justify the variance between GLAS rates applicable to privately-owned Natura and commonage, given that non-commonage landowners also require the services of a planner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>The agri-environment scheme GLAS is one of the schemes included in Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme which is currently being considered by the European Commission.

The Commission also appoints the Inspector of Mental Health Services who, in accordance with the Act, is required to visit and inspect every approved centre annually and, as the Inspectorate thinks appropriate, to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being provided.<\/p><p>  Under the 2001 Act, the Commission has a number of powers in relation to approved centres.  These include the attachment of any conditions it considers appropriate to the registration of such centres.  Such conditions could include the requirement to introduce or to review specified policies, protocols and procedures relating to the care and welfare of residents. In addition, the Commission can prepare codes of practice for the guidance of persons working in the mental health services.  As a consequence of the Commission carrying out its functions, I am satisfied that the rights of patients are regularly and appropriately reviewed in line with mental health legislation.<\/p><p>  In regard to the temporary admissions of some children to adult units, this arises only where an appropriate placement is not available and the Mental Health Commission must be informed outlining the circumstances of the admission.  Services must outline what efforts have been made to admit the chid to an age appropriate approved centre and what are the plans to place the child in an age appropriate approved centre in line with Section 33(3)(e) of the Mental Health Act 2001. <\/p><p>  In regard to the specific service and welfare issues raised by the Deputy these are the statutory operational responsibility of the HSE and have been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

The teacher's role in the holistic development of all students is clearly threaded throughout the Council's Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers. Initial teacher education providers aim to prepare teachers for all aspects of students' education, that is subject and curricular education as well as students' holistic development. Course curriculum in the colleges of education and the education department of universities include studies that underpin the student teachers' understanding of the broader emotional, environmental and temporal contexts that affect the students in their charge.  Prospective teachers are made aware of their responsibilities in relation to children's well-being - physical, mental and emotional - and to their roles and responsibilities regarding the appropriate and timely referral of children to external support agencies. The Deputy may also be aware that guidelines for primary schools on promoting pupil well-being and mental health are currently being developed by my Department. It is expected that the guidelines will be available later this year or early in 2015. <\/p><p>  These guidelines will complement 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' which were published by my Department in 2013. These guidelines were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <\/p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model. Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers, the HSE, Health Promotion Officers and other external agencies and support services. This support is available to all schools.<\/p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is &quot;Well-being&quot;. It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of &quot;Managing Myself&quot; and &quot;Staying Well&quot;. In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others. <\/p><p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme.

Our public water infrastructure is deficient and inadequate as a consequence of decades of under-investment and the lack of a truly national approach that could maximise the impact of investment. <br\/><br\/>An Independent Assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network.  The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility. <br\/><br\/>This was implemented through the Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 which provided for the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to Irish Water.  The transfer of responsibility took effect on 1 January 2014. <br\/><br\/>The Independent Assessment also pointed to the particular strengths of the local authority system in relation to locally based teams, and this positive aspect is preserved through the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) put in place between Irish Water and local authorities which garner the knowledge and expertise of local authority staff combined with the network and utility management experience available to Irish Water, to provide for a more consistent and efficient service for customers. <br\/><br\/>Since its establishment, Irish Water has implemented key systems to provide for a more strategic approach to managing water services assets and underpinning priority investment. Capital investment in core infrastructure over the period ahead will be substantially more than in 2013 and operational savings of some &euro;12 million have already been achieved in 2014 through a national approach to procurement. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water, like other utilities, will have the capacity to fund investment without adding to the Government Debt.  It would not be possible to fund the same level of investment if the responsibility for water services had re mained with local authorities.  The independent regulation of the sector, by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), will ensure that operational efficiency is achieved across the sector, in Irish Water&rsquo;s central services and in the Service Level Agreements.  This will take account of international benchmarks and will be focused on ensuring that customers are only charged for an efficient service. The Water Services (No. 2) Act provided the CER with statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br\/><br\/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan.  Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at :  <br\/><br\/>. <br\/><br\/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. <br\/><br\/>Consideration is currently being given to measures to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging structure to ensure water charges are modest and affordable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600073#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Qualifications","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600073#WRX00600"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[42489\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600073#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his proposals to facilitate the registration of grandfather architects in the new buildings regulations and architects registrations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[42638\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600073#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will facilitate the registration of persons with long experience as architects under a grandfather provision even if their qualifications do not fulfil the full requirements for newly qualified architects, in view of their proven track record and experience; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 232 together.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 sets out the statutory arrangements for the registration of architects.

While planning application fees are kept under regular review in my Department, I have no plans to reduce the fees at this time.With regard to development contributions, my role as Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply. <br\/><br\/>In January 2013 , my Department issued updated guidance for local authorities on the issue of development contributions which recommended, inter alia, that development contribution schemes should endeavour to facilitate job creation through targeted support for specific development types.  As part of the new guidance, planning authorities were asked to consider whether there were any measures open to them to support new or existing enterprises in their areas by, for example, reduced development contribution rates, deferred payment arrangements, etc. <br\/><br\/>In response to the request to review their schemes, all four Dublin Councils have since reduced their general development contribution rates by an average of 26% with other local authorities also lowering their rates. <br\/><br\/>One of the actions in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy<\/i><i><\/i><i>for a Renewed Construction Sector<\/i>, which was published in May 2014 and is aimed at facilitating increased acti vity in the construction sector, is that developers be enabled to avail of reduced development contributions for existing planning permissions that have yet to be activated.

Under the proposed provisions, developers with planning permissions granted under previous development contribution schemes will be enabled to avail of the reduced development contribution charges being applied under the new development contribution schemes where their permissions have not yet been activated.  This measure is intended to assist in making developments more economically viable and bringing them on-stream earlier than might otherwise be the case.

The Action Programme<i><\/i>indicated that, in the context of the reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts would provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. The approach taken to rates harmonisation was to seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to a significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services and, on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment.<br\/><br\/>My Department consulted with local authorities and devised a &lsquo;Base Year Adjustment&rsquo; (BYA) mechanism to phase in increases and decreases in the ARV over a maximum of 10 years. From 2015 onwards, ratepayers will receive a rates bill clearly indicating the new harmonised ARV for the area but the annual amount payable by the individual ratepayer will be modified by applying a credit or debit to that bill i.e. the BYA. <br\/><br\/>In 2015, this adjustment will effectively neutralise any increase of decrease for ratepayers that would otherwise take effect as a result of the difference in the new ARV for 2015 and that which applied in their rating authority in 2014. In other words, ratepayers will not pay any more (or less) in 2015 than they did in 2014, except in circumstances where there has been a change in the valuation of their premises or other circumstances affecting their liability. The BYA for 2015 will therefore be equal to the difference between the old ARV for that ratepayer and the new ARV. This credit or debit base year adjustment will reduce annually as harmonisation is achieved over a period of years.<br\/><br\/>The decision on the new ARV and the amount of adjustment to be applied each year, and consequently the number of years it will take to harmonise the ARV for the county, will be a decision for the elected members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600074#WRY00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600074#WRY00850"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[42651\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110600074#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the amount of requests from Kildare County Council for more staff; and the areas they were for.","asker":"1037","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>The moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service was introduced in March 2009 in response to the financial crisis.

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements (SLA). The SLA approach reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount. The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <br\/><br\/>Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the internal capabilities required within the organisation and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for Irish Water. It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website, <br\/><br\/>The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that the pay model is something which was inherited from the parent company Ervia and therefore was not directly put in place by Irish Water. Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary, as occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case. The issue of pay progression is not a matter that would have been raised with my Department as it does not arise at present, given that a pay freeze is in place until 2016. Pay progression thereafter is not automatic and will be dependent on, inter alia, affordability.<br\/><br\/>The Government will shortly consider proposals to establish a unified board arrangement for Ervia and Irish Water.
