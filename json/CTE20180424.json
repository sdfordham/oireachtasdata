I am accompanied by colleagues from the Department.  Mr. Frank Maughan is head of climate mitigation and awareness, Mr. Eamonn Confrey is head of electricity policy division and Ms. Rebecca Minch is head of energy efficiency and affordability division.  I also acknowledge our colleagues from the EPA and SEAI.<\/p> <p>  The Government published its first statutory national mitigation plan, NMP, in July 2017, explicitly recognising that it does not represent a complete roadmap to achieving the objective of transitioning Ireland to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The mitigation plan begins the process of development of medium to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  Importantly, the national mitigation plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  Policy development and implementation will happen in parallel. <\/p> <p>  Climate mitigation policy requires strong governance and accountability including oversight by the Oireachtas, independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council and co-ordination across Government supported by continuing investment and robust technical and analytical input.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 requires relevant Ministers to present an annual transition statement to both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out details of measures and actions, and their effectiveness.  A climate action high-level steering committee, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and meeting quarterly, drives ongoing policy development and implementation.  It has met twice to date.  The technical research and modelling group, TRAM, chaired at assistant secretary level and meeting monthly, provides the necessary analytical support.  The committee has identified 45 actions as being relevant to its work today.  A separate briefing note was provided in advance on progress on these actions and we look forward to engaging with the committee on them.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of ongoing policy implementation and development, and building on the national mitigation plan, it is important to highlight the publication in February of the national development plan, NDP, which will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade to address the significant climate mitigation challenges that Ireland faces.  It provides for a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, and the built environment.  Almost &euro;21 billion, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, will be directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society.  In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. <\/p> <p>  Preparation of the national energy and climate plan, NECP, which is an EU requirement, is at an early stage, with a draft to be finalised by the end of 2018 and the final plan to be developed by end-2019.  In terms of climate mitigation policy, the NECP will need to align with and, where possible, build on the NMP and the NDP.  Given the significant investment priorities already identified in the NDP, the NECP is likely to have to look to taxation, regulation and behavioural change actions and measures to further develop mitigation policy at this juncture. <\/p> <p>  Decarbonisation will involve fundamental societal transformation, as well as ongoing engagement with society through the national dialogue on climate action, NDCA.  The central objective of the dialogue is to create awareness, engagement and the motivation to act across society. Under the dialogue, a climate ambassador programme commenced in September 2017, a climate action week took place in October 2017, a green schools expo was held on 22 February 2018, and the EPA hosted a series of lectures on climate action policy.  An advisory group has been established by the Minister to input into the organisation of regional and local events that will be piloted shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Matthew Crowe, director of the office of evidence and assessment, and Dr. Stephen Treacy, a senior scientist.  We welcomed the publication of the national mitigation plan and are supporting its implementation through the actions assigned to us and through our broader climate functions and responsibilities, which are listed in our submission.  We now see a robust policy framework in place through the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan.  We can now move to implementation and action as we address climate change.<\/p> <p>  I will give a high-level overview of greenhouse gas emissions trends before handing over to Dr. Crowe.  Overall, greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland are increasing and that is making achievement of our decarbonisation goals ever more difficult.  In 2016, the latest year for which we have numbers, our greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.6% and we recorded increases across all the main sectors of the economy.  Agriculture, for example, increased by 2.7%, transport by 4.1%, and energy industry emissions - mainly power generation - increased by 6%.  When we look out to 2020 and our commitments to the EU effort-sharing decision, we are moving off the pathway and trajectory required to meet those targets.  In fact, in 2016 we exceeded our annual binding limits for greenhouse gas emissions.  Those figures and the national emissions projections that we publish every year show that we are faced with challenges in terms of meeting those targets and our aspirations under our national policy position.  If we are to move on to a sustainable trajectory, we need to implement all of the measures that are in our national mitigation plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eimear Cotter"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>As Dr. Cotter mentioned, implementation of the national mitigation plan, the adaptation framework and the national development plan, which are interlinked, is now key.  However, we also need to get the balance right between the urgency of getting on with the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society and making the right decisions for the future.<\/p><p>There are many challenges ahead, but there are also many opportunities for Ireland.  If we get this right, Ireland can be a leader in this transition, which we can discuss further later.  Many of the EPA actions in the national mitigation plan are in the research area.  The committee will be aware that the EPA co-ordinates environmental protection research on behalf of the State, and has been doing so since 1994.  It has also been funding climate change research for over a decade.  This is helping to build capacity and knowledge foundation in our universities, colleges and institutions that can support this transition.  The EPA makes an annual call for proposals in three areas, water, climate and sustainability, the most recent of which was made yesterday in respect of 2018.  We have a number of co-ordination committees, involving the funding agencies, Departments and agencies, that help us with our work.<\/p><p> Action 11 is to co-ordinate the production of an annual report on climate change research from the National Climate Research Co-ordination Group.  We have also been tasked with developing a periodic assessment of key findings of that research every five years.  We are currently scoping out those two reports and we expect the first report will be published in 2019.<\/p><p> Actions 78 and 90, on which we are co-lead with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are around building our knowledge base on carbon neutrality in an Irish context.  In the call announced yesterday, we have called for proposals in this area.  Regarding action 8, climate dialogue, the EPA will have a supporting role in establishing and running the national climate dialogue.  We are in the process of hiring three staff to establish a secretariat to support the Department and the advisory group in that work.  We look forward to our role in the climate dialogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Crowe for his presentation and I now invite Mr. Gannon, chief executive officer, of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>What is important with regard to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in the context of the national mitigation plan is that it does not encompass all of our activities.  We also perform an analysis and design support role to the Department with regard to policies and, separately, SEAI is the statutory body mandated to prepare Ireland's energy statistics and energy projections.<\/p> <p>  In terms of SEAI's vision, simply put, we would like Irish society to use less electricity and energy generally, to use cleaner energy and also to innovate.  Increasingly, we are seeing a convergence of these three activities, particularly around the human in the home, the car and in small businesses.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the national mitigation plan specifically, we set a tracker for all of the national mitigation plan activities, including those specifically tasked to SEAI as the primary correspondent and those where we could provide support.  We examined all of the timelines and, separately, sought activities where we could support other agencies and catalyse an increased or accelerated pathway for their own activities.  We see this is a minimum bar for performance as opposed to a limit of our ambition.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the specific activities allocated to us, they are all on track, bar one.  The only deviation from that one is that we determined with external expertise and with the Department that a lower than anticipated sample size was required for the warmth and wellbeing scheme.  I will outline some of the highlights.  With regard to the warmth and wellbeing pilot scheme, which looks at the co-benefits of energy efficiency, we are working with the HSE, the Department of Health and our line Department to determine what health benefits there may be from energy efficiency upgrades.  With regard to the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme, a building was launched last week by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, which moved from a C1 energy rating to an A2 energy rating, resulting in 60% to 65% savings.  With regard to the behavioural economics unit, its first report will be published in May.  These analyses over 100 different interventions worldwide in sustainable energy with empirical results and will provide recommendations to a variety of Departments and other bodies in Ireland on how we could engage behavioural economics in the design of our policy.  We have also started engaging more with the OPW, the Department of Education and Skills, and public sector bodies to show that leadership role.<\/p> <p>  The key messages with regard to the national mitigation plan activities is that they are all achieved or on track and, separately, we see it as a minimum bar of performance as opposed to a target.  I am sure that throughout our discussion I will elaborate further on some of the activities we have done in addition to this minimum bar that will touch on a lot of the points raised at the Citizens' Assembly, for example, and in respect of other activities on which we work with other Departments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Before calling members I would like to put some questions to witnesses, commencing with the Department officials.  The climate change advisory council published a report last December in which it criticised the plan and stated that it is not sufficient to put Ireland on a pathway to achieving its 2020 targets or long-term decarbonisation objective.  Do the officials accept that criticism and, if so, what steps are they taking in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I thank the SEAI for its presentation.  I think the authority is doing well in terms of completing its tasks.  I have a particular interest in the retrofit pilot.  During previous appearances before the committee the SEAI outlined the expense involved in relation to the pilot.  I note from today's presentation that SEAI hopes to have a further 100 homes completed this year.  Perhaps Mr. Gannon would explain the reason for the small scale of the project and why only a further 100 homes are expected to be completed this year.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the EPA, I am interested in the issue of methane emissions, particularly from livestock.  Is the agency aware of the Canadian and Australian research by James Cook University of Queensland and James Cook University Australia in particular which found that the addition of a less than 2% dried seaweed to a cow's diet could reduce methane emissions by as much as 99% and if Teagasc or any other body is working on that research?  It seems too good to be true but I would welcome the witnesses' views on the issue.  <\/p> <p>  I will invite Deputy Stanley and Deputy Dooley to put their questions at this point, following which the witnesses can respond to all three sets of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#D00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.  My first question is to the Department officials.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the national mitigation plan is not fit-for-purpose and lacks specific actions to bring us on the journey on which we need to go over the next two years, 12 years and 32 years up to 2050, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  Does the Department have specific plans to immediately revise the plan?  According to the EPA, and all the other bodies involved in this area, we will over-shoot our 2020 targets.  What specific actions are being planned by the Department to accelerate a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the SEAI, leaving aside waste generation, power generation is where the lion's share of our emissions come from.  In terms of the move from large-scale generation to micro-generation from renewable sources such as solar, prices in Ireland are the fourth highest in the EU.  I brought forward a Bill dealing with micro-generation, which I am sure the witnesses have reviewed.  I would be interested in hearing their views on the Bill and on how households and small businesses can become involved in generating electricity, which is common practice in other countries.  While some people in the industry would say that the cost of transitioning will be high, as I said, prices here are already the fourth highest in the EU and we have not yet started the journey of transitioning to renewable fuels.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment.<\/p> <p>  Competition in the market is around switching rather than the cost of electricity.<\/p><p> The EPA representatives said in their presentations that greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase.  What recent proposals or specific plans are going forward from Government to help to reduce emissions?  Specifically, I want to refer the question back to the Department.  From what we can see, the national mitigation plan is lacking in specific actions.  I argued the point at this committee four or five years ago when we were dealing with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development legislation.  The fact that the Act did not have binding sectoral targets was a fatal flaw.  What is the EPA view on setting specific sectoral targets for the electricity production, heat and transport industries?  Do we need to do that?  It is worth pointing out that our biofuel usage has decreased by 8% and in some ways we are going backwards.  At this point do we need to set specific sectoral targets to move on?  Much of this is coming from the generation of power and we need to start taking action in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#D00500","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will bring in the Department officials first to answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will address the Climate Change Advisory Council view that we will not meet our 2020 targets.  The Department accepts that in terms of the latest Environmental Protection Agency emissions projections, which have been outlined.  We are going to be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels as against the target of 20% below 2005 levels.  There are reasons for this, including reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn.<\/p> <p>  It is worth making several points about the national mitigation plan and some of the criticism that is being levelled against it.  The document was published in July 2017.  It is a direct and honest document.  It quite clearly stated the scale of the problem.  It recognised that we would not meet our 2020 target.  It also set down measures that we have in place and measures under consideration.  It was a real statement.  It also recognised its own inadequacy in terms of not setting out a complete pathway to decarbonise by 2050.  Given the challenge to decarbonise by 2050, not to mind 2020 or 2030 targets, and the way technology changes so rapidly, it would not be possible to set out a clear pathway all the way to 2050.  What the national mitigation plan said was that it would become a living document, a first step.  It was not the case that the plan was in place and set in stone and that we could move to implementation.  We are implementing but we are constantly developing policy at the same time.<\/p> <p>  It may be unfair to say that there is a lack of specific detail in the mitigation plan.  There are 106 actions, some of them very important in terms of enabling us to move forward with climate mitigation policy.  A total of 61 sectoral measures were in place and 17 sectoral measures were under consideration.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan makes good on the promise that mitigation policy will be developed on an ongoing basis or that the national mitigation plan will become a living document.  In the national development plan, &euro;22 billion is earmarked for climate mitigation investment.  Some &euro;8 billion of this is Exchequer investment while &euro;14 billion is non-Exchequer.  That investment will make a significant impact in decarbonising in the period to 2030, but we will still continue to develop policy on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  I will set out a flavour of some of the things in the national development plan.  There is an objective to have 500,000 electronic vehicles on the road by 2030.  From 2030 onwards fossil-fuelled cars will not be allowed to be sold in Ireland and from 2045 there will be no NCT certificates issued for such cars.  The plan aims to increase the retrofitting of houses to 45,000 per annum to BER B rating, which is a deep level of retrofitting.  We know that 500,000 houses are remote from the gas grid and largely reliant on fossil fuels for heating.  The plan is for 170,000 of these to be transitioned to sustainable heating by 2030.<\/p> <p>  The national mitigation plan was the first step.  We said we would continue to develop policy.  The national development plan is the next iteration, within the climate priority, of the development of mitigation policy.  There is an EU requirement to develop a national energy and climate plan.  Again, that will give us further opportunity to bring forward new policy, possibly looking at the areas of taxation and regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I hear what Mr. Carroll is saying about where we want to get to and how the national mitigation plan identifies the problem.  The point I am trying to raise is that we are not even going to go a quarter of the distance we need to go in reducing greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2020.  According to the EPA, and the Department agreed with the appraisal today, at best we will reach 4% to 6% of the targeted reduction, whereas in fact we should be at 20% of it.<\/p> <p>  Every time we raise the point, we hear about what is planned and the &euro;21 billion and so on.  The problem is the slow pace.  We are not even off the blocks on solar power.  We have not even got into offshore wind yet.  We are still messing around with public transport.

We are only going to get about a quarter of the way to the 2020 target.  We had reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn.

The national mitigation plan, the national development plan and the national energy and climate plan, which is forthcoming, are part of that process.  We need to start looking out to 2030.  We need to ensure we are in a position to meet our 2030 target and try our best to exceed that target.  What is in the national development plan represents a step change and it is a commitment to significant additional investment.<\/p> <p>  Over 50% of transport emissions come from private journeys.

I know the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will probably want to come in on this point.  The Minister announced in January his proposal for a microgeneration scheme in the summer, which will be a first phase.  That will start at the domestic level for domestic consumption only.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley has published draft legislation.  Some of my colleagues have been talking to Deputy Stanley's team on the outline of the Bill.  There are many good points in that Bill that the Minister is keen to try to facilitate where we can do so.<\/p> <p>  We are working closely with SEAI on gathering the evidence and the appetite among the public for the take-up of domestic microgeneration.  Our sense is that there is a good deal of enthusiasm, but we want to do it on a phased basis to ensure we get it right.  We want to ensure that we do not necessarily make some of the mistakes that we have seen in other jurisdictions.  That is very much the plan at the domestic level.<\/p> <p>  More broadly, solar photovoltaics technology has been assessed as part of the new renewable electricity support scheme.  Again, Deputy Stanley probably will be aware that we undertook a major consultation in this area and a second and final consultation late last year.  The Minister's intention is to go to Government for approval of the overall scheme design shortly.<\/p><p>Thereafter, we will begin the formal state aid notification process.<\/p><p> According to international analysis, the costs of solar PV have decreased dramatically over the past six or seven years and the indications from the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, and others suggest that costs still have a way to travel in terms of reductions.  This is good because while electricity support schemes do not have a direct Exchequer impact since they are funded through the PSO levy, we are keen to ensure that we do not lock in too high in respect of some of these technologies.  The indications are that solar PV costs will continue to fall, which is good, and that it will have a role over the next decade and out to 2030 because, as Mr. Carroll mentioned, the targets are challenging in all sectors.<\/p><p> The cost trajectory for offshore wind energy generation is positive.  Costs continue to fall and there is renewed interest in a number of projects, particularly on the east coast, among developers who would like to take the projects forward.  Offshore wind has also been assessed as part of the new support scheme.  We are encouraged by the trajectory of prices and we are working closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the necessary legislation for future offshore renewable energy because of the licensing and consenting process that will be needed.  The Minister will be going to Government shortly in respect of the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.<\/p><p> The other issue related to biofuels.  Last Friday, the Minister announced his intention to increase the biofuels obligation to 10% by volume as of 1 January 2019 and to increase it again to 11% from 1 January 2020.

With regard to the 100 homes and our deep retrofit pilot scheme - as opposed to the more commoditised schemes under which we have, over the past few years, decarbonised the offering and upped the performance level required in tens of thousands of homes annually - this will build an evidence base for policy decision-making.  We are establishing the level of performance required in the housing stock by 2050 to meet our carbon goals and then we are looking at the different home types within that - be they apartments, rural cottages or semi-detached houses in Dublin - and asking which technology solution gives the best return on investment for either the Exchequer or the individual, whether the supply chain is robust enough to deliver that solution, what an individual will think about the value of that and whether he or she can finance it.  We are interacting with the European Investment Bank and high-street banks to establish how we get finance to individuals if not through a grant or tax incentive scheme.  We need to do a small number of tests and to go deeper for that.  That is why the numbers appear low for the scheme but it is targeted.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Stanley's queries, it is inevitable that we will see an electrification of heating and transport in people's homes in particular.  The cost curves of technologies are helping that to happen.  Solar PV costs have reduced by 85% in the past five years while the cost of electric vehicles, although incentivised, is narrowing and will continue to do so.  What is telling in that industry is that the manufacturers are sending the same signals as governments regarding the fact that they will stop making diesel and petrol engine cars over time.  They will lead the consumer because we are all consumers and we are convinced sometimes that a mobile phone is worth $1,000 because we are told that is the case.  If the products we are offered move in the direction of electric vehicles, we will buy them.<\/p> <p>  In addition to this cost curve and consumer offering, the EU brought out a clean energy package prior to Christmas 2016 which articulated three principles, namely: people should have a right to generate electricity in their home; a right to export; and a right to a market price.  It is not clear how that will come about down the line but it is coming.  Part of the tests we will run when we satisfy the request from the Department to run a solar PV grant scheme for homes will examine that.  For example, if a human was to receive a payment from the grid or have an electric vehicle in their home or a battery in their home how that would that work?  Our focus will be on having people deal with their homes first before turning them into a business.  They should examine their consumption and how to improve that.  That will be knitted into our general programme.  We will also work with companies such as the ESB to ensure that transformers on estates will be able to deal with that demand and to research the cost of that because the electricity system will be used in a way that it has not been previously.  We need to make sure the balance of costs, if we give individuals this opportunity, is appropriate and does not increase prices too much.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with the cost of electricity, large-scale renewables and auction systems internationally.  We currently have a feed-in tariff system.  The auction systems force private sector companies to bid against one another in a competitive process to provide a renewable electricity service.  The premium Ireland should have to pay for that should continue to decrease for the consumer such that the loading on to the consumer will discontinue.  However, that will take time to catch on.  Ireland is a costly country in which to do business.  Our licensing and consenting schemes are complex and there is uncertainty about timelines, particularly in the offshore sphere.  The work being done by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department under whose aegis we sit is, therefore, important and timely.  There is increasing interest in projects off the eastern and western coasts on the part of not only technology developers but of finance houses that do not generally care where they put their money to work.  It is important that the opportunity is recognised in Ireland and that we leverage from that.<\/p> <p>  Switching rates comes under the remit of the CRU.  Its officials are doing work with the PRICE Lab on that and how to make it easy and clear for people to switch.

There is no silver bullet.  My understanding is that that was discovered on a farm close to the coast.  The cattle were grazing on a particular type of seaweed and then the farmer noticed differences in them.  Work is ongoing.  There is a possibility of an additive that could be fed to animals being developed at some point.  However, additives have many downsides, including the possibility of trace elements being left.  There are food supply issues which have to be thought through in this regard as well .  Ireland's agriculture system is extensive.  The animals are outside eating grass most of the year.  This type of thing might be applicable in Ireland but it may be more applicable in systems where animals are indoors most of the time and fed in a different way.  The issue for the EPA in respect of agriculture in the context of the plan is the policy statement states, \"Developing an approach to carbon neutrality for agriculture and land use, including forestry, that does not compromise sustainable food production\".  That is a complex sentence.  What we want to see - and we will work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and others - is the approach figured out sooner rather than later.  This will get us into the issue of the balance between the way the land is used for agriculture and forestry and how peatlands are used and getting a much better understanding of how our land performs overall in terms of carbon.  Depending on how it is managed, land can absorb carbon and be a sink for it or it can release carbon into the atmosphere.<\/p><p>We need to become a lot more knowledgeable on this issue in order that we can start to plan for carbon neutrality, where land in Ireland is managed in a way that it will be a net sink for carbon as opposed, in some cases, to being a source, as it is currently, particularly in the case of peatlands and the manner in which they are managed.

They were published last year and showed a shortfall in meeting our 2020 targets.  We are working on updating the numbers, but the overall message remains relevant.  On what we would like to see happen to bridge the gap to our targets, what is required is full implementation of the national mitigation plan and delivery on the ambitions and commitments contained in it.  As policies and measures are developed and elaborated on by Departments, we are reliant on them to give us the detail in order that we can work them into our projections and analyses and thus determine how we are doing in following the trajectory to meeting our 2020 targets and outwards.  We are here to talk about overall implementation of the national mitigation plan.<\/p> <p>  On the individual sectors and what we would like to see happen, we have already touched on many of the issues which arise.  Heat and transport are the two most difficult sectors.  On the heat side, what is required is a combination of energy efficiency, about which we have heard much today, and a ramping up of the scale of energy efficiency in buildings and businesses, while also looking at the use of cleaner renewable energy.  The Government has already committed to providing a renewable heat incentive which should help us to make strides on the heating side.  <\/p> <p>  On transport and the ambitions in the use of biofuels, again, a combination of measures is required.  Transport is a really difficult sector.  It is about the use of alternative fuels and technologies such as electric vehicles and also looking at other issues outside technology, including integrating land use planning and transport investment.  Much of our investment has already happened in this space.  As we look to the future, we must ensure that where we build houses, businesses and schools we have transport investment such that the reliance on private cars will be reduced.  This may include the provision of fiscal incentives.  We have seen some success in the rebalancing of VRT and motor tax rates to encourage people to buy cleaner vehicles.  It is always going to about be a suite measures.  There will never be one solution.  These are really difficult sectors in which to achieve progress.  Given their dispersed nature, we will need to move on all fronts.

The departmental review of this issue is quite depressing.  I direct that view towards the Government rather than the officials present.  The Government has not shown the political will needed to address what is now a crisis based on what the EPA had to state.  We have known for some time the extent to which we are going to miss our targets.  For a while there was a denial at Government level that we would miss them.  The expectation was that we would catch up, but it has been known for some time that this is not going to happen.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the departmental officials.  Has the cost, in terms of the fines we will have to pay for missing our targets, been estimated.  Has there been any advance planning in that regard?  When do the officials think we will hit our 2020 targets?  Given that we know that we will not do so in 2020, in what year are we likely to hit them?  On reading through the material provided by the Department it crossed my mind that, just like the gambling addict, we were putting everything on the next race, namely, the 2030 targets, even though we have not figured out how to address the 2020 targets.  The presentation is peppered with ifs, buts and maybes.  We know that technology is improving, but 2025 is beyond the cycle of the Government and many of us here.  It appears that the Department is in the position of not being able to do anything.  It cannot bring forward proposals that would make a serious stab at addressing the crisis; therefore, it is pushing the issue out to the future and hoping for the best.  At that time it will be somebody else's problem.  If one takes that approach, whoever is in government in 2025 could take the same approach because at that time there will be different technologies and new ways of doing things.  That has always been the standard cover for not doing anything and leaving an issue for somebody else to address.  <\/p> <p>  I have considerable sympathy for the departmental officials, given the Government's lack of support for them.  There is a lot of talk, as well as a lot of plans, dates and acronyms, but no action.  Some work is being done by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in developing pilot programmes and projects, but I do not get the impression that there is money available to roll them out in a meaningful way.  We still have the Government buying diesel buses because, we are told, the alternatives will be cheaper at a later stage.  Some 120 diesel buses were purchased recently.  We are told that the next fleet of buses will use an alternative fuel or be battery operated and thus be more economical.  I have been hearing about 50,000 electric vehicles for a long time, but nothing has materialised.  Anybody who takes an interest in this issue and reads the blogs will know that the people who have bought such cars would readily part with them in the morning if they could do so.  The reality is that the infrastructure to support fast-charging is not in place.  The issue is not range anxiety but range reality because no effort is being made at a central level to support those who have made the shift.  We know how behaviour has changed.  It is about ensuring the people who make a change will be supported, but those who have bought electric vehicles have not and are not being supported.  My eyes glaze over when I hear the Minister make announcements about electric vehicles and the provision of support for their purchase.  There was nothing in the budget in that regard.  There was talk about benefit-in-kind being eliminated for three or five years, yet in the Finance Act it was only captured for 12 months, with a review promised with a view to it being continued for a further three years, which is ridiculous.  Companies that are buying fleets need certainty, but there is not that certainty.  All we are getting is lip-service and announcements.  The Government is great at doing that, but the people who are attempting to change their behaviour are not being supported.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps all of the delegations might get together, with a view to identifying three or four steps that they would take that would have a meaningful impact in addressing the 2020 targets.  It is not acceptable for the Government to state - again, I am not attributing this to Mr. Carroll, but he is here representing the Minister and the Government - that we are only one quarter of the way there, that there was a downturn and that there is nothing we can do.  When will the targets be reached and is there anything the Department can do to fast-track its approach to getting closer to the targets than what is anticipated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#G00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>A representative from the SEAI said it was a cornerstone of its strategy that we should reduce the amount of electricity we consumed, for obvious reasons.  Wearing another hat, I know that, when completed, the proposed data centre in Athenry will add between 6% and 8% to Ireland's electricity consumption.  There were plans - I do not know if they are still in place - to have at least four such centres in Ireland, which, on the face of it, would look like an uplift of between 28% and 35% in our electricity demand.  I appreciate that electricity demand differs in that some of it is constant, while there are also peaks and troughs.  It appears that IDA Ireland has been pursuing a policy of attracting data centres to Ireland and that it is Government policy, writ large, that Departments seek to attract multinational data industry investment to Ireland.<\/p><p>On the other hand, since we are talking about an increase of 32% or 28% from four centres or plants alone in Ireland, someone seems not to be talking the same language as other people.  We have to make up our minds.  Do we want data centres in Ireland?  Do we want to increase our demand for electricity by that amount?  How can we possibly diminish our demand for electricity in the gross while increasing it in four locations in that way?  Who is going to call a halt to this plan?<\/p><p> It may very well be the case that some of these international companies would like to have their data centres in Ireland and I do not blame them for that.  I have no doubt that it probably makes for good economics and politics to attract them to Ireland by holding out the possibility that they can locate such centres in Ireland.  However, if we are going to increase our electricity consumption by the order of 30% for four centres with minimal employment consequences no matter where they are &ndash; they are care and maintenance facilities &ndash; then surely at some stage we must admit that we can no longer afford to pursue that policy, especially when we are missing all our targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#G00700","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the deputations all for the presentations.  I assume everyone here accepts the science of climate change.  I believe if the deputations were able to be honest &ndash; they probably cannot say what I can say &ndash; they would agree that the national mitigation plan is rather depressing.  It does nothing to get us to where we need to be.<\/p> <p>  The projection given by the Environmental Protection Agency in the presentation is frightening.  I assume that it is scientifically absolutely accurate.  Anyway, it is frightening to look at the graph and see how we came from 1990, when we were at a given level of CO2 emissions per tonne.  The level went up during the boom and then back down again during the recession.  We are beginning to climb again.  The last figure we have is for 2016.  Where do we need to be by 2050?  The target is 5 megatonnes.  How the hell are we going to get there when it has been said here today that it is not possible to set out a plan to 2050 and that it is a working document?  I can see why it is not possible.<\/p> <p>  One thing that illustrated this to me above all in recent weeks was the excited announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of a new deal with China for thousands of cattle and thousands of tonnes worth of dairy product.  That was followed quickly by the discussion in the D&aacute;il and the debate among farmers on the fodder crisis.  We had a fodder crisis because climate change meant that it had rained heavily not only this winter but the previous winter as well.  We had a fodder crisis because the big producers bought up all the fodder when the climate responded as it did.  Thus family farmers cannot manage to feed their cattle and cattle are dying.  Yet, these family farmers have admitted to us that they are coming under increasing pressure all the time from the Department and their own organisations to breed more cattle and dairy cows because the market is dictating the pace.<\/p> <p>  I can see why the market is attractive.  Certainly, it is not attractive to family farmers in this situation but it is attractive to mega-producers.  We need a plan whereby Departments speak to each other and whereby the economy has some level of grip on what is happening with climate change.<\/p> <p>  I come from the left and therefore I have more interest in a planned economy that does not allow the free market to reign supreme.  I believe that at some point the free marketeers are going to have to sit up and take notice.  Otherwise they are going to destroy the planet and bring us to the point where there is no return from climate change.  That is why I am keen to see a Minister and Department that scream at other Ministers and Departments to stop doing this and explain we need to talk to one another, join the dots and plan this out together.  I realise the deputations must be extraordinarily frustrated and angry that this is not happening because they are all scientists and they all know what is going on.<\/p> <p>  I wish to put some specific questions to the Department.  Why does the national policy position not mention industry, manufacturing, waste and other types of energy emissions?  Why are these left out altogether?  I am not going to make any assumptions about it.  Can the Department representatives expand on the point a little?<\/p> <p>  I am keen for the discussion about transport to be teased out a little.  I hear other Deputies referring to the need for non-diesel buses.  To be honest, however, the real problem is the amount of private cars on the road.  The level of emissions from private transport is far higher than emissions from public transport.  If we could reduce private use of cars on the road to a fraction of what it is at present, we would be doing ourselves a major favour in respect of our emissions.  One need only be on the M50 early in the morning to see gridlock on a four-lane motorway in both directions and then understand that the private use of cars is far out of proportion.  The reason is bad planning.  When industry, homes and estates are built it is clear planners and developers do not take into account the need for transport hubs to be nearby.  Such considerations may be in the development plans of county councils &ndash; when I was a county councillor I recall working out the plans for transport hubs - but the plans are never implemented in a reasonable way that takes private cars off the road in large numbers.  Will the EPA representatives and others comment on that point?  Perhaps they do not see it as the role of the agency to comment.<\/p> <p>  I know it might be seen as a gesture but would the organisations represented here, including the Department, support the Bill on climate emergency measures to leave fossil fuels in the ground?  The Bill will be before the committee in July.  Does the Department see that as a positive measure in contributing to reducing CO2 emissions and sending out a signal that we need to wake up, smell the coffee and take this seriously?  There is nothing in the plan to show us that we are plotting and managing what has gone off the radar in terms of our emissions.  The EPA graph says it all.  Everyone should look at it because it is startling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#H00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Deputy Ryan, do you want to come in now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#H00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Yes.  I will continue with the aforementioned graph because it tells us a great deal.  First, it shows that one can reduce emissions.  Reducing emissions plummeted from 2008 to 2011.  We were on our way to our targets.  What happened between 2008 and 2011?  Half of the cause was the recession but I remember the EPA analysis published in 2012 suggested that half of the reduction was because of political commitment in government at the time and a range of different measures that were introduced.  That was my experience.  It is possible to do it.  It is good for the economy.  It is the new economy.  It is where the jobs and opportunities are.<\/p> <p>  I utterly refute Mr. Carroll's argument that we are not good at climate because we have had an investment shortage for the past ten years.  I have heard Ministers trot out the argument time and again.  What investment shortage is behind our increasing emissions?  What particular investment was the Government unable to provide in the past seven years that is the cause of our shameful climate record in the past seven years?  I do not believe that argument.  The reason is because of a lack of commitment in the public service and the political system to do what has to be done.  There has been no sense that this is a priority.  When we went to Europe the priority was to use all our political capital to try to get out of climate commitments.  We pleaded to save Irish agriculture and to be allowed to sell as much cheap beef to the Chinese as we could.  That is why our figures are so poor.<\/p> <p>  The graph is dramatic because it shows the possibility of more ambitious targets.  I do not see how we can have any emissions in 2050 at the level of 5 million tonnes.  That holds even if we accept the unambitious Government target, as Deputy Smith put it, of 800,000 tonnes per annum.  The latest EPA figures show that the energy, built environment and transport sectors are growing.  Instead of shrinking by 800,000 tonnes, the level is increasing by 1.8 million tonnes in these sectors.  That is the scale of the problem.  I am certain that the 2017 figures will show a further increase of 1.2 million tonnes.  We are further away.  We have to make a bigger jump or leap.  I trust the EPA figures.<\/p><p>The series of reports presented to us, including last year's update in terms of where we are heading, even with additional measures such as shutting down Moneypoint, project an increase of 34% by 2035, including 5% in residential emissions and an increase in transport emissions.  This is in spite of all the additional plans.  We, therefore, have a problem and serious change is needed.  It is a political and public administration problem in that we have all these plans and structures but emissions are increasing.  Does the EPA agree that if we were serious about emissions, the State would stop peat extraction immediately?  How many million tonnes would that save?  If the officials cannot give me the figure now, perhaps they can write to me separately.  If all peat extraction was stopped, how many million tonnes would that save us in the jump we have to make?  How much might the State get paid under the new Paris Agreement climate commitments?  How much would we benefit by showing what we have done internationally to make significant cutbacks?<\/p><p> There are many energy-related questions but I will go back to the process.  We have a national climate dialogue, climate advisory committee, national mitigation plan, and a new European climate and energy plan, all of which are iterative processes.  The best analysis was presented by the Citizens' Assembly.  Its members recognised the scale and pinpointed the problem.  They said it is a lack of political leadership.  It is not that Irish people are bad at this; it is that there is no leadership.  They came up with strong, positive suggestions such as ending peat extraction, reversing the transport budget ratio from 2:1 in favour of roads to public transport, which we need to do anyway or else our cities will be gridlocked, and adopting a proper national land use strategy under which forestry is taken seriously.  None of these is mentioned in any of the national plans.  We must take this issue seriously.  As a committee, we will have to consider the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  What should we do with them?  How will we get the public administration and political systems to realise we must do something about this now and not, as the Taoiseach has said, by 2030 or 2045?<\/p><p> Mr. Carroll's submission said the new national energy and climate action plan, \"will revert to taxation, regulation and behavioural change actions\".  What will be the taxation measure?  We introduced the carbon tax during our time in government and I am proud to have done it but taxation will not be the key change.  Regulation and Government decisions to dramatically invest in retrofitting will be key and not just putting in &euro;8 billion.  The Government should aim to have every house on an A rating.  Why stop at a B rating?  Why will the Government not introduce regulations tomorrow to ban fossil fuels?  Why are fossil fuel heating systems being installed in 67% of new houses when there is a brilliant heat pump alternative?  Those buildings would work for heat pumps because they are properly insulated under improved building standards but we need to stop Fine Gael gutting them all the time.  That scale of political commitment and pulling everyone together because it will be a new economy and it is what the country will be good at, is required.  We would benefit in many ways, including a lower fuel import bill and not being shamed internationally, with Irish people feeling good about themselves by helping to prevent a fundamental crisis.  The problem is a lack of political will.<\/p><p> How do we as a committee turn that around and instill that in our consideration of the Citizens' Assembly's work?  Currently, there is lots of effort and gazillions of plans but our emissions are increasing by between 3.5% and 6% per annum in different sectors.  I bet the figures for 2017 and 2018 will not be different.  I am sure our emissions will increase by 5% again this year, which will push us further away from our targets, while nothing is happening, 67% of new homes are burning fossil fuels and peat is being dug up as if that is clever.  Our agriculture policy is to increase emissions as if that is clever and the Government is taking a negative stance according to the European files on all the climate and energy packages.  At an informal Council meeting last week, all the leading member states, including Denmark and Portugal, said they want a higher renewables target.  If the Government parties were serious about climate change and our economy, they would have supported this call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#H00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked many questions.

That pattern has tracked the economic downturn and the pickup in economic activity having come out of the downturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>An EPA statement in 2012 outlined that half of the reduction between 2008 and 2011 was due to the economic recession and the other half was due to political commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#J00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>With regard to how much this will cost, over the compliance period, we had an annual emissions ceiling below which we had to remain.  For a number of years, we were below the ceiling because of the economic downturn.  We can bank that as credit for years we exceed the ceiling.  The combination of being under it for an extended period and exceeding it now means that we have to purchase few allowances to ensure compliance by 2020.  We have banked the amount under the ceilings which offsets us being over it, and there is a few years for which we will have to purchase allowances.  We do not know yet how much they will cost.  It will depend on supply and demand but we anticipate a surplus of allowances will be available and the cost of purchasing compliance will be relatively low.<\/p> <p>  Looking beyond that, the focus is very much on 2030.  I will move on to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's questions and then return to other issues.  She asked about the issue of industry and so on.  Ireland's legally binding obligations arise in the non-ETS sector.  Agriculture accounts for 45% of our non-ETS emissions.  When transport emissions are added, that brings us up to 73%.  When the built environment is then included, we are dealing with the bulk of the emissions.  There are emissions from a variety of sources relating to manufacturing combustion and industrial processes and they are in the main regulated under the EU ETS system.  That is a cap and trade system and, therefore, there is no legal obligation on the State.  It is up to the installations to manage their emissions and to buy and sell allowances.<\/p><p>I will address Deputy Ryan's question and after that I will hand over to colleagues to address the question on data centres.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the national mitigation plan and the follow-on of the national development plan.  I believe there is a significant commitment in the national development plan.  The Exchequer and the fiscal arrangements are relevant.  One thing we had to comply with as a result of the bail-out meant that the Exchequer's capacity to spend or borrow was limited over a period.  We are coming out of that period now.  The additional investment in the national development plan largely kicks in from 2021 onwards.  There is a serious commitment.  Over half of transport emissions come from private journeys.  There will be a total of 500,000 vehicles by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure.  There is a commitment to no non-zero emissions private cars to be sold in Ireland post 2030.  There is a commitment to issuing no NCT certificates for non-zero emissions cars post 2045.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The cycling budget in Dublin was halved last year.

A commitment to no diesel-only buses to be purchased from 1 July 2019 is in the national development plan.  Decarbonising our public transport is important in cities for air quality reasons and to bring about the necessary modal shift.  The scale of the challenges are relevant since 4% of our transport emissions come from public passenger journeys while over 50% come from private car journeys.  That is a where one big issue lies.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Ryan on retro-fitting of houses.  The figure of 45,000 per annum from 2021 to 2030 represents approximately one third of the stock of existing houses.  Clearly, it is not all about Exchequer spend.  Taxation has a role as does regulation, but we have an existing stock of houses that are going to exist for a long time and they need to be dealt with.  Earlier I referred to 500,000 one-off houses that are remote from the gas network and that burn fossil fuels for heat.  Some 170,000 of these are to be transitioned over the decade.  That represents one third of the one-off houses that are remote from the grid.<\/p> <p>  I believe these are significant commitments and step-ups in the national development plan.  Earlier, I referred to the national energy and climate plan &ndash; I accept that we have a series of different plans, but the nature of mitigation policy is that as time passes and technologies change, we have to constantly add to policy.  That is not going to change.<\/p> <p>  One thing raised by one of the Deputies was the need for Departments to be talking to one another.  We have the structure in place now through the high-level steering group chaired by the Minister that brings all the Departments together.  Sitting under that we have the technical research and modelling group.  This is a research group that brings in Departments agencies and the likes of the universities to give the sort of analysis we need to choose cost-effective and appropriate policies.  I will pass over to my colleague to address the question on data centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will go back sequentially on some of the questions.  Deputy Dooley asked about fines.  I can set out the position on the outline costs on the renewable energy side.  The expectation is that we will be several percentage points short of the 68% binding target to be met for renewables by 2020.  We will probably be in the range of between 2% and 3% short by 2020.  Work undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland some years ago indicated that the cost per percentage point of not meeting a renewable target would be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point.<\/p> <p>  The 2009 renewable directive provides that member states who may not meet their 2020 targets can purchase what are called statistical transfers to allow them to achieve compliance.  In 2017 Luxembourg was one of the first member states to sign a co-operation agreement with Lithuania and Estonia to provide for statistical transfers.  Our estimation of what that deal meant is that the costs for Ireland could be below the lower end of the range that SEAI indicated some years ago.  I suppose it is a market and it will certainly depend on market conditions if and when those purchases come to be made.  We have already begun some informal discussions with several member states that we believe may be in surplus and that Ireland may end up having to purchase from.  From an Exchequer point of view, any potential shortfall would be spread over several years.  The cumulative costs would not be known until 2021 because that is when the final accounts for 2020 are put together.  Certainly, we are keeping Government apprised of the potential exposure on that side.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, our focus is very much around bringing forward the different schemes that have been mentioned.  For example, the support scheme for renewable heat will hopefully open later this year or early next year.  That will certainly target facilities in the commercial and non-domestic sector, in other words, the commercial and industrial sectors.  One of the Deputies asked what we were doing on that side.  I believe that will have a significant impact, especially given the renewable heat challenge that we face.  It is challenging for reasons of our settlement patterns and so on.  They make it especially challenging on the heat side.<\/p> <p>  I already mentioned renewable electricity and the new renewable electricity support scheme.  The expectation is that the Government would approve the scheme in the coming months.  That would certainly open for auctions in 2019.  Jim Gannon made a point earlier on this.  It will represent a change from the fixed tariffs that we have had to this point.  It will be very much arranged on a competitive basis.  I hope we will be reaping the benefit and reward of those lower technology costs that I mentioned earlier, especially around technologies on solar, offshore wind and onshore wind, which remains one of the cheaper forms of technology that we have successfully connected to our system in large numbers.<\/p> <p>  Senator McDowell asked about data centres.  He mentioned a particular development in Athenry.  I will outline what the Government has been doing in the meantime.  All the relevant Department and agencies, including IDA Ireland and EirGrid, have been meeting since last autumn to bring together a strategic response.  What does that mean?  There have been amendments under way to the planning Acts to try to designate data centres as strategic infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Hold on a second.

This would ensure the demand on the Dublin area is not as significant.  The Senator mentioned the peaks and troughs that are experienced as part of load management.  Data centres can assist with more balanced load management because they are run on a 24-hour basis.  The further decarbonisation of the transport sector will also be of assistance in this regard because electric vehicles can be charged at night.  I do not disagree with the thesis that data centres present a challenge for the electricity system.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is trying to formulate a broader Government response that ensures we do not walk in blindly and allow those involved with these centres to locate them in the locations they want.

Deputy Dooley spoke about how we can increase our budget, our ambition and our activity in a short timeframe.  We find it quite positive that a good proportion of the &euro;22 billion which has been provided for the next ten years has been attributed to climate action.  In the past 20 months, since my appointment, our budget has increased from &euro;75 million to &euro;150 million.  Demand for our generic capital schemes with businesses and home owners has increased in line with the increase in our budget.  The challenge has been to ensure there is robustness in the supply chain, for example among the contractors who are going to deliver the work on the ground.  Many of our efforts involve working with those involved in the supply chain to increase quality and volume, to give them confidence that there will be a demand for these services over time and to assure them that when we come to the end of this period of high-profile activity, there will be something to blend down at the tail end, although we would be lucky to be set with that challenge.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Dooley's comments about electric vehicles, it is worth noting that sales of such vehicles increased by 50% last year and have increased by 50% again in the first quarter of this year.  If one tries to order an electric vehicle now, one will be waiting between eight and ten months because of a shortage of supply.  The demand is there.  I do not see people parking them on the side of the road.  The purchase of second-hand electric vehicles is a significant growth area.  People are buying such vehicles on the domestic market and importing them.  This shows that people in all segments of the market, and not just new car buyers, are able and willing to go out and buy electric vehicles.  It is likely that the type of person who is buying a second-hand vehicle already drives an older car.  We are doing more to incentivise people and to inform them of their options in this regard.  The initiative in this area that we launched last week is not a public awareness programme; it is designed to inform consumers about these matters.  Separately, when we took over the provision of support for domestic chargers in January, we made a change to enable someone who wants to buy a second-hand electric car to apply for support for a domestic charger.  Prior to this, support was provided to those buying new electric vehicles only.  We are working hard with the Department to put procurement in place in respect of the fast-charging network.  We expect to be able to go to the market in the third quarter of this year and the fast-charging will follow soon after that.  This dovetails with the decision-making process in the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the ESB regarding the existing infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I would like to return to a point Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith made earlier and with which I do not particularly disagree.  I suppose transport planning, at its root, is a spatial planning challenge with socioeconomic considerations.  By the time there is a discussion on switching from diesel or petrol to electricity, the wrong question is being asked.  The question that should be asked relates to the number of people who are having to drive in a car to a place.  I was very thankful for and heartened by the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly with regard to switching towards public transport from roads infrastructure.  There is a tendency in that direction.  We have to acknowledge that the capital development plan looked at more sustainable forms of transport and at a modal shift away from cars.  By the time these issues get to my door, we are answering the wrong question and we are mitigating a symptom as opposed to anything else.<\/p> <p>  I would like to pick up on some other specific points that were made.  I sympathise with some of the views expressed by Senator McDowell.  As far as I can see, work is ongoing.  We face a certain challenge.  Just as there is a perceived conflict, if not an actual conflict, between some of our agricultural policy and our climate policy, there is a similar conflict between our business and enterprise policy and our climate policy.  We will continue to face such challenges.  It is important to ask questions about the methods used to address those challenges and the infrastructure used to face them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Gannon about it again next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#L00600","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if the Senator would do so.  I am nearly at the end.  I will respond to one or two of Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments.  Certain activities are under way in response to the work of the Citizens' Assembly and in response to some signals that were sent.  They were under way by the time the report came out.  The Deputy mentioned the assembly's recommendations relating to land use, public infrastructure and peat.  I have gone through the specific recommendations made by the assembly in respect of electric vehicles.  Community ownership with regard to renewable electricity is embedded in the new renewable electricity support scheme.  I spoke about grid electricity from a microgeneration payment earlier in response to Deputy Stanley.  It is up to us to design that into a grant scheme and see how we can make that valuable as the clean energy package comes down the line.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan also asked about public sector leadership.  We work with all public sector bodies, including Departments and the bodies under their aegis, to look at their commitments and achievements.  There was a significant tonal shift at the start of last year when the public sector energy efficiency action plan moved from making people responsible for reporting to making sure they are accountable to perform.  I think that was quite important.  We experienced an upsurge in the level of interest in the technical and grant-giving supports we can provide.  We have provided a number of million euro over the past couple of years.  We have worked with the OPW and the Department of Education and Skills to look at the leadership roles they can play in communities, for example by upgrading their business beyond what would be considered to be a normal energy upgrade.  I will give a separate example.  Hearteningly, the HSE recently tested the use of electric vehicles in a rural environment, as opposed to an urban environment.  Local taxi fleets were regularly being used in County Donegal to bring patients on dialysis in County Donegal in and out.  We have shifted them towards electric vehicles to see whether that could or should work.  If it works, the HSE may be in a position to roll such a service out across other areas.  I think part of that is coming in as well.  I think I have covered the questions that were directed at the SEAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon.

I am glad she referred to our graph.  We consider it to be a particularly important graph because it is stark.  It shows the scale of the challenge.  It also shows the reversal of the trend that existed, for whatever reason, in the period before the current period.  The point I want to make is that the EPA will continue to report annually on the emissions inventories and the projections.  As Dr. Cotter mentioned, we will use verifiable information when we are developing the projections.  It is absolutely crucial for the things that are set out in the plan and in the national development plan to be implemented.<\/p><p>As those plans start to evolve and develop, they will then find their way into our projections.  Obviously, the obverse, if they do not happen, is that they will not find their way into our projections and the projections will continue to portray the kind of picture that is presented in that figure.<\/p><p> We are required by the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to produce a state of the environment report every four years.  The most recent report was in 2016.  We have started work on the next one which will be for 2020.  In the 2016 report, we looked in some detail at energy, transport and agriculture.  We included in the submission to the committee a summary of the key messages from those chapters for those three particular sectors.  In terms of the provision of a roadmap for where to go with all this, those chapters provide good information as to what we need to do in Ireland to head in the right direction here.<\/p><p> Collaboration is hugely important in this area.  It is significant that all the State agencies are collaborating and working together on this.  We do work in other areas, for example, the Water Framework Directive, which is only looking at water.  It is complex enough to get everybody to collaborate in such a space.  This is covering the entire economy and society and it is very complex.  The collaborative structures are being put in place.  They take time to bed down.  It is about building the structures that enable the different Departments and agencies to work together on a common goal.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley asked what we can do in the shorter term in this regard.  It is difficult to see what can be done up to 2020 that will make a major impact by 2020 merely because it is now the middle of 2018 and it is not that far away.  The type of things we all need to focus on are, for example, changing the way that we make electricity.  If one looks at the key message for energy in our submission, currently, fossil fuels provide approximately 90% of Ireland's energy.  That is for everything, including electricity for housing and for transport - the entire energy system.  We have a long way to go to get to the point where we have a decarbonised system but if we can figure out how to make electricity in a different way that is not dependent on fossil fuels, that then opens the door for a lot of other things.  For example, if we all bought electric cars, which we would plug in, the electricity charging those cars would not be generated by fossil fuels whereas at present a significant proportion of it is.  That is centrally important to getting the transition right.<\/p><p> The second point, which Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned and with which we would agree with, is about doing as much as we can, and more if we can, in the area of improving the efficiency of our homes because we all live in a home.

I wanted to make a couple of observations about that.  I was fortunate to be able to sit in on the first day of the discussions on climate change.  It was a superb process.  There is a great deal that we can learn from the process as well as from the report that was published in the past few days.  As the climate dialogue is evolving, there are many lessons to be learned from the way it was done, and the fact that one had 99 citizens in a room discussing a fairly complex topic such as climate change over two weekends, being given the information in a dispassionate way by a bunch of different people from different organisations, and then discussing it themselves and coming up with the conclusions  they did.  It is incredibly powerful.  There is a lot of richness in that report and we can all benefit from looking at that, working through the report and seeing how we can best evolve it.  In terms of engaging citizens, there is a lot to be learned just from the process of how the Citizens' Assembly was run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Crowe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524578400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will pick up two points to add to what Dr. Crowe stated.  First, on the data centres, I cannot add anything in terms of the nub of the question and the overall national position.  However, from the EPA's perspective, I can tell the committee that we continue to provide the evidence on Ireland's future emissions.  In looking out to 2020 and beyond, we work in the impact of data centres.  I would make the point that our national emission projections include the impact of data centres.  Many of those data centres fall within our environmental regulatory regimes, such as the EU emissions trading system, ETS, that regulates CO2 emissions, albeit with a very low price signal at present, and more recently, within the Medium Combustion Plant Directive.  That is by way of supporting information.  I recognise it is not getting to the nub of the question.<\/p> <p>  On the peat question, we have been consistent.  Our director general spoke at the Citizens' Assembly.  We have mentioned in the state of the environment report that we need to move away from fossil fuels and we need to do that with a greater sense of urgency.  As we have heard, over 90% of our energy consumption comes from fossil fuels.  That includes, of course, carbon intensive and inefficient fuels, such as peat.  We can come back with more detailed information on the impact of that.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Treacy, who has been going through our large national inventory report to give some estimate of the impact of peat extraction and combustion currently.

All the expectations are that is going to go higher.  In respect of energy efficiency it will be at 30%.  We are inching towards the June council where I expect Ministers will be asked to agree on the overall package.  However, as I said, we are broadly supportive of the EU ambition across the clean energy perspective.  We need to see that Ireland can achieve its contribution to what will be an EU-wide target and that it can be done cost effectively.  The work that Mr. Carroll mentioned earlier in respect of both the TRAM analysis, and indeed the SEAI modelling that is under way, will inform the policies and measures that we as a collective are going to have to put together as part of the first national energy and climate plan.

It is clear there is a strong understanding in the room of what has to be done and the sheer scale of it.  We are working hard on understanding how that should be done.  We are mindful, as are the Deputies and Senators, that ultimately it is about people deciding to act.  It is not just about the technical measures we put in place to be carried out.  I refer to the capacity we build among different sections of the economy and society to make that decision to act.  Then there will be the opportunity to undertake work in our homes and our businesses.<\/p> <p>  That is why we are seeing a really important shift occurring in how incentives are designed.  I will give one example of how this is tapping into the level of demand people have rightly pointed out is needed.  I refer to the warmth and well-being scheme we got going in 2016.  It is a joint policy initiative between our Department and the Department of Health to provide comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades to the homes of people at risk of energy poverty but also suffering from chronic respiratory problems.  We put together the criteria for the scheme in co-operation with the Department of Health and on the advice of the HSE.  It is jointly delivered by SEAI and the HSE, hence the importance of the supply chain as Mr. Gannon pointed out.  The critical lesson being learned - and this is an important issue for all of us to remember - is the importance of supporting people in their decisionmaking.  I refer to supporting the client then on his or her journey through what can be quite a significant undertaking, particularly in their own homes.  <\/p> <p>  To be frank, while that might sound quite soft, it is proving to be the catalyst that could really unlock this.  When we put those  measures in place - those kinds of supports for warmth and well-being - that is been carried out in a relatively small geographical area among a very specific cohort of people.  By the end of this year, we will have upgraded a thousand homes.  We are on course to spend &euro;20 million over the three years of the pilot programme.  When people hear about this through intermediaries they trust and see as independent, and they are supported by the SEAI and the HSE on the journey, the response is there.  That tells us much about how we need to go about this.  Providing that kind of support is obviously demanding on the system.  <\/p> <p>  I will briefly address the public sector.  There is no basis for complacency but it is important to note that, based on the robust data gathered and analysed by the SEAI, we know the public sector has improved its energy efficiency by 20% since the baseline of 2009.  That is the national target.  It has achieved that already.  It shows the importance of the public sector getting out in front.  The emphasis in the public sector has been a great deal on the built environment.  There is no doubt that there are huge opportunities in transport with public sector fleets.  That is something we know we need to get at and we are working closely with colleagues in transport.  That is definitely going to be the next chapter in that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Minch"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Can I come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#N00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Yes, very briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018042400002#N00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524578400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>This might not be possible now but it might be something the EPA might come back on.

This is my first time to appear before the committee.<\/p> <p>  To facilitate the committee in understanding the operation of the national lottery, it is useful to provide members with a timeline of the changes which came about when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform awarded a 20-year licence to Premier Lotteries Ireland on 27 February 2014, which began operating the national lottery on 30 November 2014.  The first regulator was appointed on 17 November 2014 and resigned on 3 May 2017 to take up a post elsewhere.  I was appointed on 9 October 2017.  In the period before the first regulator was appointed and the interim period between our appointments, the Minister acted as the regulator. <\/p> <p>  I would also like to draw the members' attention to the respective roles of the operator and the regulator.  These roles are set out in the National Lottery Act 2013 and the licence to operate the national lottery.  Under the Act, the operator of the national lottery has the sole purpose of operating the national lottery in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence.  The operator must report to the regulator on its activities and it must appear before this committee when requested to do so. <\/p> <p>  The functions of the regulator under the Act are to procure the holding of the national lottery; to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence; to manage and control the national lottery fund; to consider for approval certain matters relating to the national lottery, including schemes for national lottery games; and to exercise the enforcement rights of any trademark of the national lottery.  The regulator must exercise these functions with the objectives of ensuring the probity and long-term sustainability of the national lottery, that the interests of participants are protected, and, subject to those objectives being met, maximise returns for good causes.<\/p><p>Thus, the regulatory role centres around ensuring that the requirements of the Act and the licence are being met, with statutory powers to support this.  Some aspects of the operation of the national lottery require regulatory approval in advance and I have statutory powers to investigate any apparent breaches.  Operational matters which do not require approval or are not a breach of the licence are entirely a matter for the operator.<\/p><p> The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery is staffed with relevant expertise to support its functions.  This includes expertise in accounting, audit, law, psychology, data analysis, risk management and regulation.  I am trained in regulatory governance and have a background in regulating for effective competition and consumer protection.  I am joined today by the deputy regulator and head of audit and finance, Mr. Derek Donohoe, who was previously a partner in a leading Irish accountancy practice with significant experience of auditing, forensic accounting, corporate governance and compliance.<\/p><p> In order to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator, my office has a range of information-gathering mechanisms in place.  These include 31 different regular reports from the operator; real-time access to data from the operator&rsquo;s business systems; regular meetings with the operator; oversight of the processes and controls applied by the operator; monitoring the marketing and PR activities of the operator; and other proactive reviews, investigations, and requests for reports or information on specific matters.  The information we glean from these monitoring activities is combined with my powers under the Act and a risk-based approach to ensuring compliance.<\/p><p> A range of the operator&rsquo;s activities require the written approval or consent of the regulator.  These include new lottery games, new service providers, and changes to codes of practice for sales, advertising and promotion, participant relations and employee vetting.  Every request for approval or consent is scrutinised to assess whether it complies with the Act and the licence.  Each assessment involves a wide range of aspects of the request and of the licence.  If the regulator is not satisfied that a request is compliant, the operator may be asked for further information or explanation.  Often, the operator submits an amended proposal or an explanation that removes any concern and the request is ultimately approved.  If the operator is unable to address the concerns within the required time limit, the request is rejected or withdrawn.  Since the commencement of the licence, the regulator has received 113 requests from the operator that have been considered and concluded.  Ultimately, 87 were approved, 19 were rejected, and seven were withdrawn.  I have attached to this presentation an up-to-date list of these requests.<\/p><p> A key function of the regulator is to manage and control the national lottery fund.  Every week we thoroughly review detailed financial reports from the operator and receive and disburse funds appropriately.  We can cross-reference these weekly reports with both the real-time access we have to the operator&rsquo;s systems and other reports we receive.  The fund is audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Under the licence, prizes must, on average across the portfolio of national lottery games, be at least 50% of sales.  The amount allocated to good causes is 65% of the difference between sales after free ticket prizes and retailer&rsquo;s commission, and prizes.  Returns to good causes have increased each year since the start of the licence.  In 2017, over &euro;226 million was transferred for good causes.  The amount for 2016 was &euro;218.9 million, &euro;7 million of which related to sales in previous years, and in 2015 it was &euro;193.3 million.<\/p><p> The operator has provided the following information.  In 2017, 1.45 million people played lottery games on a regular basis, that is, in the past month, representing 41% of the adult population.  Ticket sales for 2017 amounted to &euro;800 million and in 2016 to &euro;750 m.  Sales for draw-based games were &euro;559 million in 2017 and &euro;530 million in 2016.  Scratch card and online instant win games accounted for &euro;241 million in 2017 and &euro;220 million in 2016.  With respect to the sales channel, 93.5% of sales in 2017 were in retail and 6.5% were online.<\/p><p> The number of retail outlets increased from just over 3,700 at the start of the licence to 5,780.  The largest part of the increase resulted from extending the network from one third of post offices to all post offices, including sub post offices, in 2016.  Some 1,811 of the new retail outlets operate a restricted range of draw-based games and scratch cards.  Some 500 of these are post office outlets co-located within an existing national lottery retailer.<\/p><p>The same codes and controls apply to every retail outlet regardless of its ownership or size.<\/p><p> In 2017, on average over the whole network, terminals were available to sell tickets 99.98% of the time.  Availability of website services varied from 99.81% to 99.99% of the time.  This performance is in line with the 99% standard required under the licence.<\/p><p> I hope the information in my presentation has been helpful to the committee in providing an overview of the operation of the national lottery and the role of the regulator.  I look forward to answering members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Boate","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524573000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Boate and call Senator Conway-Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042400002#M00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1524573000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Boate for her presentation.

That is perhaps what would be done with a code in the financial or any other sector.  In this case, however, there is only one licensee and the State has signed a contract with the licensee to run the national lottery for us.  It is our national lottery, but essentially they run it for us and they can take the profits.  They paid &euro;405 million for that licence and my job is to ensure that the contract is enforced.  It is unusual, perhaps, because there is only one company involved.  It is they who draft the codes and the licence does specify what those codes must cover.  The sales code is not the easiest example to talk about.  Perhaps the advertising code is easier to understand in the sense that one of the major exercises that was done in 2016 and 2017 was to put all of the rules about advertising gambling that are in the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland's code into the advertising and promotion code applying to the national lottery.

I am concerned that the increase in the number of outlets is matched by an increase in the resources going into overseeing, monitoring and supporting every retail outlet.  What is very important is how national lottery tickets are sold or not sold.  As I mentioned earlier, the sales and advertising codes apply equally to every type of outlet and to every individual outlet.  It is the operator's responsibility to make sure every outlet is selling tickets responsibly.  That includes things like having very visible signs about it being an over-18s product.  It should be very clear it is only for over-18s.  They are obliged not to sell to anybody under 18 and if they think a person might be under 18 they must ask for identification.  They are obliged to engage in responsible selling and there are training videos, posters and materials to support that.  The operator is obliged to monitor this and make sure it is happening.  I then monitor the operator and hold the operator to account.  If there is a large increase in the number of outlets, as the Deputy has correctly pointed out, there should be a corresponding adjustment to the resources and tools being used by the operator to oversee them.

I hope that she makes her voice heard in the appropriate manner because - forgive me for using this language but I am trying to think of a better way - hiding behind what it says in the Act is not good enough.  What the regulator is overseeing is a hugely aggressive promotion of the national lottery.  I read an article that appeared in <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>last year and it was about a pilot project in a number of stores, including Tesco, Dunnes Stores and SuperValu, where scratch card card dispensers containing up to 19 different games were installed in every checkout aisle.<\/p><p>When I read that I was reminded of when I got elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas first.  I was in the Seanad and I had the pleasure of sharing the backbenches with former Senator, Feargal Quinn, who imparted many stories during the couple of years I was there, one of which was that he was the person who moved sweets from the checkouts.  First he made one aisle free of sweets, because of the pressure it placed on parents, and then he went further.  Now we have gambling in every single aisle with these dispensers.  What do the dispensers look like?  They look like the same thing from which one would buy a packet of Mentos, a Mars bar or such like.  It is a nice plastic cage, designed in that way not by accident, but deliberately.  This is how one sells sweets in shops and this is how we now sell scratch cards, which surveys show is the most accessible type of gambling for our teenagers.  We have not heard any public commentary on that in the context of the regulator.<\/p><p>I suggest the regulator needs to make her voice heard.  Maybe she thinks it is okay but I would say it is not okay, and we will say this to the Government and to the Minister.  There is a responsibility on the regulator.  It is the job of the regulator to apply the law, and I see no fault in the way the regulator is applying the law to her job, but there is an onus on regulators to say the law is not robust enough or does not go far enough.<\/p><p>I have not heard that from the regulator in respect of what is happening with the national lottery.

I am joined by my departmental colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, principal housing adviser.<\/p> <p>  While Ireland is a relatively young country in comparative terms, one of the key challenges facing it is planning for and addressing the needs of the rapidly ageing population.  In recognising and valuing the achievement and benefits of the population living longer, we need to ensure quality of life is maintained and nurtured.  Government policy on housing for older people, as set out in the programme for Government and Rebuilding Ireland, is to support older people to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Research has consistently shown that older people wish to age in a place close to their family and friends and in the community where they may have lived for many years.  This policy approach is also seen as being both cost effective and contributing to a greater sense of well-being for older people.<\/p><p>For many, living in adapted or specialist housing reduces reliance on health and social care services and can result in measurably improved health status.  My colleagues in the Department of Health are best placed to speak about these issues.  However, it is important to acknowledge that housing policy on older people is broader and more complex than the mere provision of housing.  Addressing the needs of older people requires a cross-departmental approach and inter-agency co-operation.  The provision of housing for older people, particularly as we look at the future needs of the ageing population, will require a good mix of housing and health policy.  Towards that end, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health have been working closely together in recent months.  We are finalising a joint policy statement on housing for older people which it is envisaged will be published this summer.  We want to ensure older people will have a wider choice of appropriate housing options suited to their needs, including housing with care services and supported housing, and to give them an opportunity to plan for their changing needs in good time.  As consulting key stakeholders and interested parties is a crucial part of this work, we may develop policy options that are responsive to the diverse needs of older people.  <\/p><p> The policy statement will be a first step in the broader process and it is proposed to hold a conference later in the year.  It will be a consultative forum for all stakeholders and interested parties to identify and discuss the range of issues ikely to emerge.  The conference will be hosted jointly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  St. Michael's estate in Inchicore has been identified as a housing with support pilot model under Rebuilding Ireland and will deliver 52 care homes which are due for completion in 2020.  It is a collaborative project between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health, the HSE, Dublin City Council and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  It is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people to act as an exemplar for others to follow.  The project has been approved for funding of almost &euro;15 million under the Department's capital assistance scheme, with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents.<\/p><p> On the challenge we face on housing generally, I reassure the committee that Rebuilding Ireland contains specific commitments to meet the housing needs of the vulnerable in society who include older people.  In addition, local authorities have been advised that the delivery of social housing targets under Rebuilding Ireland should be consistent with the housing need identified in the annual summary of social housing assessments, which means that the housing needs of older people will be addressed.  It should be noted that Part M of the building regulations also sets out the minimum statutory requirements a building must achieve in respect of access and aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment underpinning the principle of universal design.  If the committee wishes, further detail can be provided on Part M requirements, the implementation of which is very important in meeting the needs of a range of individuals, including the older population.<\/p><p> In line with a commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, the Department, in collaboration with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, ran the homes for smart ageing universal design challenge which aimed to stimulate and encourage the design and construction industries to be innovative in designing and delivering housing solutions for older people.  The challenge attracted more than 60 high quality entries, which was testament to the high level of engagement by the industry in designing and delivering innovative housing solutions for older people.  The competition winner, the Abhaile project, has established itself as a new enterprise and is actively pursuing pilot projects and clients with its innovative housing solution.<\/p><p> As members are aware, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provides significant funding for social housing projects incorporating housing for older people.  In addition, we support adaptations to private housing through the housing adaptation grants scheme for older people and people with a disability.  The Department also provides funding and policy support for the local government sector in respect of the age friendly Ireland initiative which is active across all local authority areas.  These supports are aimed at facilitating the changes needed to make the homes of older people and people with a disability more suitable and to enable them to continue living independently in their own homes for longer, as well as facilitating early return from hospital stays.  Rebuilding Ireland has committed to increasing the funding available for these grants.  In fact, funding has increased year on year since 2014.<\/p><p>Total funding in 2018 is &euro;62.2 million, which represents an increase of 11% on the total for 2017   Further consideration will be given to increasing this funding in the  coming years in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  The grants are also being made more accessible with a new single application form to be issued soon, with an easy to read guide to filling in the form.  <\/p><p> With my colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, I will be happy to take questions from members and engage on the issues raised during the course of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend the meeting on the subject of housing for older people.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, services for older people.<\/p> <p>  People are living longer than ever before.  Success in improved health and extended life expectancy has been achieved in recent decades and should be acknowledged and celebrated.  Life expectancy for a woman aged 65 years in 2015 is estimated at 21 years, up 22% from life expectancy for a woman aged 65 years in 1995.  For men, the figure is 18.4 years, a rise of 36%.  However, as well as opportunities, the ageing population poses significant challenges that need to be recognised and addressed across a wide range of areas.  Every year there is an increase of 20,000 in the over-65 population.<\/p> <p>  People of all ages make up a community.  By and large, engagement with senior citizens clearly indicates that they would prefer to stay at home for as long as they can.  We all recognise the benefits the older population has to offer society as a whole.  The Department of Health, with its partners in the health sector and beyond, is looking at how we can facilitate and support their wishes and preferences.  A particularly important factor in realising this objective is improving home support services in order that people can live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible.  This year the budget of the Health Service Executive, HSE, for the provision of home support services is &euro;408 million, which will deliver over 17 million home support hours to about 50,500 people.  While the existing service is delivering crucial support across the country, it is recognised that home support services need to be improved to better meet the changing needs of citizens.  The Department of Health is engaged in a detailed process to develop a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  A range of community services aimed at supporting older people are also funded at a cost of approximately &euro;300 million by the HSE.  They include short-stay beds, day care centres and meals on wheels services.  Many of these services are provided by voluntary organisations.<\/p> <p>  The report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, supports a significant shift in the model of care to one that is focused on prevention and early intervention and which will provide the majority of care in the community.  It is crucial that the appropriate supports be in place to match each person&rsquo;s needs at whatever point he or she is at in his or her interaction with the health care system.  The national positive ageing strategy has shown us that a whole-of-government response is required to address the range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of older citizens.  The Department of Health and the HSE engage with many stakeholder groups on issues of concern to older people.  The Department also funds TILDA, the national longitudinal study of ageing, which provides valuable evidence which feeds into policy development by Departments and, in association with the HSE, Age-Friendly Ireland and Atlantic Philanthropies, leads the healthy and positive ageing initiative, HaPAI, a research programme aimed at measuring progress towards achieving the objective of making Ireland a great place in which to grow old.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to inform the committee that the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are working together in finalising a high level policy statement, to which my colleague, Ms Hurley, has referred.  It will provide a framework by which the Government can facilitate and promote a variety of housing options, including housing with care services and supported housing for older people.  In tandem with it, the Department and the HSE are participating in a demonstrator project in Inchicore in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dublin City Council, the HSE and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  The project is aimed at offering older people who do not require nursing home care the benefits of living in their own homes, connected to their communities, with support and care provided in a cost-effective way.<\/p><p>We envisage that this demonstration project will be adapted and replicated in other areas.<\/p><p> The overall aim is to develop new models of housing for older people where care, support and community dimensions are provided on-site, integrated into the community and designed with the active participation of older people themselves.  The results of an evaluation of the first phase of the project will be published shortly.  It is hoped that this project and the learning derived from it could act as a blueprint for the future.<\/p><p> I hope that this provides an overview of the Department of Health's involvement in housing for older people and we will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Spillane.

Among its many findings, it concluded that the vast majority of older people, 89%, wanted to stay in their current homes, as we have already heard.  That means, for the vast majority of our elderly population, continuing to live in our suburbs and in the countryside, but are our suburbs and our countryside ready for the changes that demographic forecasting promises over the next decades?  I want to look at the why, the where and the what of housing our aging population.<\/p> <p>  In the first case, as to why, as we have heard already, in Ireland, as elsewhere, people are living longer.  The population of Ireland in the 2016 Census was 4.8 million with projected population increases for the next 30 years ranging from 8% to 25%.  The population aged over 65 has increased by 19.1% between the last two censuses with an increase of 67,500 aged over 85.  However, the pattern is not uniform.  Fingal and Kildare have the youngest population, both rapidly growing urban areas with office-based employment.  Kerry, Mayo and Leitrim, Ireland's least densely populated rural counties, have the oldest population.<\/p> <p>  Most of the housing built in Ireland over the past century has been three and four-bedroom houses.  Of the 2 million homes in Ireland in 2016, according to the Census of 2016, 1.7 million of them were family houses.  There were 860,000 families with children in the State at that time.  There were, therefore, 900,000 more family homes than families.  We need one and two-bedroom apartments in villages, towns and cities, both as starter homes and step-down homes for older people.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI housing policy of 2016 expands on the principle of densifying our suburbs and of rejuvenating older neighbourhood centres into higher density urban village centres by examining the principles of what makes a good neighbourhood.  These are the sorts of neighbourhoods with a mix of homes to satisfy the needs of all members of society, not just families but also single people, young couples and, in particular, our older citizens.<\/p><p>These are places that have a mixed population in the sorts of numbers that make public services, neighbourhood amenities, shopping and public transport affordable and accessible.  The question is whether our current suburbs and neighbourhoods can accommodate both an increase in population while also allowing older people to remain in their community.<\/p><p> The architect, David Dwyer, director of Box Urban, has looked at the issue of increasing the population in our existing suburbs.  He analysed two typical suburban neighbourhoods in west Dublin.  Ballycragh, built in the 1990s and Ballyroan, built in the 1960s, both at a density of 17 to 22 units per hectare, that is, eight to ten to the acre, the standard old-style density in Ireland.  He defines a good neighbourhood as being able to provide all one's daily needs within a five minute walk of one's home and as needing a population of between 7,000 to 10,000 people to support a financially viable modern neighbourhood village centre.  The study investigated the opportunities to rejuvenate existing neighbourhood centres and increase the numbers of houses within a five minute walk.<\/p><p> Ballyroan neighbourhood centre serves a population of 4,000 within five minutes walking distance.  Ballycragh neighbourhood centre serves a population of less than 1,500.  Therefore, they significantly underperform on the viability test. <\/p><p>The study concluded that by making better use of the existing neighbourhood centre lands, by removing existing barriers to pedestrian movement within the area, by making better use of corner sites and back-lands and by building along the edges of main access roads and redundant open spaces, it was possible to increase the five minute walk catchment in Ballyroan from 4,000 people to 11,000 people and in Ballycragh from 1,500 to 10,800.<\/p><p> The figures confirm that in Dublin if we build out all currently zoned lands at the minimum recommended density of 50 units per hectare and densify just 40% of our suburbs at the quantum that he achieved in his study, we would comfortably accommodate population increase over the next 30 years without having to rezone a single acre of new land.<\/p><p> Realistically, however, there is a job of education needed, firstly to demonstrate to people that building more homes and services in their backyard will bring real benefits and, secondly, to have support from our public representatives to promote sustainable mixed communities.  It is necessary to halt the sprawl of our cities and our larger towns.  It is unnecessary and unaffordable.<\/p><p> We all recognise that our rural towns and villages have suffered the consequences of recession and consequent migration.  Meanwhile, there are large numbers of older people living unconnected lives in the countryside.  A possible win-win situation would involve encouraging them to move back into their local towns and villages.<\/p><p> Local authorities are starting to plan for the future densification of their areas, whether urban, suburban or rural, and to prepare masterplans that promote the principle of densification and the provision of universal access.  With careful planning, we should be looking at regenerating our towns and villages by adapting existing domestic housing for older users, improving the public realm, services and amenities and centralising our services to encourage older people to move into town.<\/p><p> We need to revisit the concept of downsizing.  It is not a bad word.  Downsizing can be liberating for those who wish to enjoy less encumbered lives and may wish to be nearer the centre of a supportive community.  We must plan it properly and architects are well positioned to make a significant contribution, not just in designing exemplar homes, but also exemplar places.<\/p><p> Currently in Ireland there are just two types of housing for the elderly, either at home or in a home.  In the private sector, as a housing architect, Mr. O'Mahony's  experience of over 50s planned living, as it is known in the UK and USA, and which he has looked at in some detail over the past couple of decades, is disheartening.  Rather than replicating the good neighbourhood model of young and old, single people and families living together in a supportive community, what he has seen is gated communities of considerable means living lives segregated from the surrounding community in what he termed as \"gilded cages\".  He considered that we should discourage this model and while not a lover of regulation that is not backed by evidence, regulation needs to be introduced that ensures a quantum of age-appropriate housing is delivered in all our private housing schemes and mixed tenure developments.  Currently it is necessary to audit the availability of local cr&egrave;che facilities, for instance, before making a planning application.  Similarly, local retail capacity studies are required to accompany commercial development applications.  The same should happen with housing for older people.  It is now time to propose that housing typologies in housing developments, particularly private developments, match the age demographic of the area in which the development is being proposed.<\/p><p>Community facilities provision in large scale developments, including build to rent housing, should also be carefully assessed to complement the needs of future older residents.<br\/><br\/>In public sector housing, there have been social housing options in the form of old people's dwellings, OPDs, and sheltered housing facilities in the past.  However, there are no options for those who are above the financial thresholds to access social housing but do not have sufficient means to support their older age accommodation needs.  The research identified a very large grouping of older people who did not want to be in residential care at any cost.  They still have the facility and mobility to live independent lives but require some supports to allow that to happen.  Over the next 30 years, we must provide for these people with housing options to downsize within communities that include an element of care but reinforce independent living and are affordable.  The &quot;Thinking Ahead&quot; study called it housing with support and public sector proposals for an exemplar scheme in Inchicore are being developed by Dublin City Council in collaboration with the approved housing body, AHB.  In its vision document, the following carefully considered thoughts of a future occupier are shared with us<\/p><blockquote>I would like an opportunity to live in my place, with my books and music, with people I like and some whom I love - who will know when to talk and when to stay quiet.  I would like that place to be where I can be myself, I would like that place designed to be a gathering place and a place of contentment and a place of aloneness.  A place where I can be as independent as I can be and dependent when I have to be.<\/blockquote><p>Who could ask for a better definition of home than that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tynan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I thank Ms Hurley, Mr. O'Mahony, Ms Spillane and Mr. Tynan for their contributions.  We had engagement about this at a previous meeting and we have loads of information.  I do not think anyone in this room needs to be convinced about the need to have support housing.  I am glad to say that the witnesses have overlapping coverage of a recurring theme, and it is positive that we have looked at design, health and planning issues.  It is complex.  The other big issue is isolation.  I am familiar with gated developments since I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I will talk about them in the private sector.  People tell me that they have had to rent in these little schemes in townhouses.  They are locked and gated.  Many people leave these gated communities every day to work.  There are opportunities for integration and such.  When one looks at the demographics, ageing and elderly people, we have to talk about that key word, community.  In some parts of the country, we have wonderful libraries where old people can go and sit down.  They would have been thrown out a few years ago.  The reality is that there are elderly people who live on their own in this city, the county and all over the country who have very little income.  They are lonely and isolated.  They literally walk the streets or go to caf&eacute;s, train stations, public libraries or, in some cases, the waiting rooms of hospitals to interact.  Sad as it is, that is the reality.<\/p> <p>  I will address a few issues, starting with social housing targets in this context.  I am disappointed in the social housing targets but that is another debate for another day.  It might have occured to the policymakers that they might have set down, as part of the social housing targets, a breakdown of those targets.  What percentage of those would be specifically for downsizing?  We talk about downsizing and I want to ask Ms Hurley if she might share with us.  There has been much talk about a downsizing pilot scheme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and we might hear a little about that and its success.  I am conscious of a place in St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan which I have shared with people here for months.  Two elderly people live in isolation in local authority units because they do not want to leave.  They want to stay there.  I do not hear much support from the Department for those two people who wish to stay.  I want to use this opportunity to make an appeal that those two vulnerable old ladies are allowed to remain in their homes in St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan.  If we are to be meaningful about our dialogue, discussion and policy formulation, we have to put it into reality.  How can we stand over a public housing policy that has spent years emptying out 16 maisonettes in Stillorgan which are next to doctors, a leisure centre, a library, churches and various supports?  If we are talking seriously about engagement, this is the type of site that we should keep and maintain, and support elderly people to live in.<\/p><p>The reality is it has been de-tenanted for years and slowly people are being picked off.  Now two vulnerable ladies are living in two houses that are being described as holding up the potential for development.  I do not want to be too specific but I want that site to be identified for downsizing and support housing for vulnerable people and elderly people because of the importance of community.  I ask representatives of the Department for breakdowns in any further social housing targets to identify the percentage of one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties.  <\/p><p> Let us deal with the facts we were told about last week.  We have a rapidly ageing population.  We have a large number of people over 55 on all our social housing lists who are unable to get accommodation.  Many of them are single, elderly and vulnerable with very low incomes.  What are we doing about that?  How are they worked into our social housing priorities?  There is an increasing elderly population particularly on our social housing lists.  Right across the spectrum it is a demographic with chronic health issues and disabilities.  Are we setting aside some of this accommodation for people with disabilities?  We are not.  If we are, we are certainly not delivering.  We know there are a number of occupiers in the private sector who have no mortgages and who are willing and want to downsize in line with everything the witnesses have advocated and yet we know there are no small units for them to downsize to in their communities.  We know that older people, and for that matter younger people and all of us in this room, thrive best when we have community supports and loved ones, family and friends around us.  It is something we all want by our very natures.  <\/p><p> I will ask some questions.  I will address the first one to Ms Hurley, not because she is from the Department but because it concerns the central tenet of the policy contained in Rebuilding Ireland.  Can she provide an update on the two - she should note the emphasis on the word \"two\" - items contained in Rebuilding Ireland on providing housing for older people?  I want her to deal with that.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the cross-departmental approach and inter-agency co-operation.  I have touched on that.  It is excellent.  The Department is currently finalising a joint policy statement on housing for older people which it is envisaged will be published this summer.  Will Ms Hurley keep the committee in the loop as that progresses?  I look forward to being at the launch, not reading about it but being there and hearing about it.  There will be a conference hosted jointly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  I ask Ms Hurley to keep the committee informed on the progress on that work.  She might indicate a timeframe for when she thinks she will have that work complete.  Everyone knows what the challenges and issues are.  It now must become policy.  The emphasis is on these social housing targets and breaking them down specifically with a focus on demographics and ageing and the challenges and priorities that need to come from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#K00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I will work through that range of issues.  The targets that have been set for social housing have been set on foot of a very detailed analysis of what is in the pipeline and what the different needs are in each local authority area.  When we started the exercise to set targets for each local authority, we provided guidance and wrote to each local authority area.  We are very clear on the particular needs.  The Senator is right about singles and two-bed apartments, in particular.  There is a huge need.  Our social housing list shows that over one third of our population is single.  In framing the targets, we have worked very closely with local authorities and have established, on a scheme-by-scheme basis, the type of delivery we expect in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of older persons, we can see what we will deliver through the CAS programme.  In terms of sustainable communities and mixed developments across various sites, we can see how many of the units will be for older people and how many will be for people with a disability.  That was the target-setting process.<\/p><p>When the Minister attends later in the month, we can touch on that matter further.  In setting the targets, we had regard to the waiting list in each local area and the mix and types of need in areas.  There was also engagement with each local authority on its particular needs.  In 2018, targets have been set across building, leasing and acquisition.  This issue is very much on our minds.<\/p><p> I will work through some of the other issues that the Senator raised regarding downsizing.  It has to be done sometimes.  It is an option.  Some people want to downsize and some do not.  We have an adaptive policy.  For example, we had two projects in Dublin last year.  At Broombridge, we delivered 51 housing units for older people with a mix that included downsizing.  A number of the committee members might have attended the opening of the second project, that being, Annamore Court in Ballyfermot.  An interesting project, it delivered 70 units last year, 16 of which were for people who wished to downsize.  Those units were designed and developed in a particular way that was supportive of older people with needs.<\/p><p> We view the St. Michael's project, which is advancing, as important.  As my colleague from the Department of Health mentioned, this model sees the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government working with Dublin City Council, the HSE and the Department of Health to get the best possible housing for older people.  That will be reflected in the design.  In order that we might learn from the project from the outset, we have developed a toolkit, which we will provide to local authorities so that what is best for older people's social housing can be determined.  This part of the learning process is important.<\/p><p> The social housing agenda is about the mix and meeting the needs of older people, people with disabilities and a range of other persons.  That is reflected in our targets and is something to which we are committed.  We will work on it.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the St. Laurence's Park project, which is close to his heart.  He has been working with the Department in this regard.  It is an important project.  We have been liaising with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to which I expect we will revert over the coming days so that the project can proceed.  The local authority will work with the individuals in the premises to whom the Senator referred.  It is a good project that will advance shortly.<\/p><p> Regarding design, my colleague, Ms Sarah Neary from our building regulations section, has been working with the National Disability Authority and the Centre for Design Innovation on how we can design homes that are Part M compliant and meet older people's needs.  A great deal of innovative work has been done in this regard, as evidenced by the competition that we ran last year where 60 applicants sent in interesting ideas.  The Abhaile Project won that competition and we are moving forward with some of the ideas.<\/p><p> I will focus on the community piece, which the Senator mentioned.  We have a collaborative and close working relationship with the Department of Health.  We are also working with our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Be it through a seniors alert scheme grant or a housing solution, we must all join together to keep people in their homes.  As such, the question of community is on our radar.  At our cross-sectoral and interdepartmental meetings, we are conscious that housing the elderly is not just about the house, but about home care, security and feeling safe.  That is something we are progressing with the housing piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Ms Hurley might touch on the only two actions that are contained in Rebuilding Ireland where our discussion is concerned.

It very important that they made joint submissions.  Joined-up thinking is what it is all about.  The one thing I did not hear mentioned yet is the question of the conservation of energy and heating in homes.  One of the most important things to keep older people in their homes for as long as possible is to make their homes as energy efficient as possible.  I welcome the schemes that the SEAI have and the community groups.  I know that in my county, in Dunleer, for example, people sign up for a scheme and it is ensured that their energy needs are met.  Notwithstanding everything else, will the witnesses comment on that?  What priority are they giving to that?  Is there any survey done of the energy deficiencies, if any, in local authority estates?  The older people are, the more likely they are to have been living in their home when the area was built.  There is a significant deficit in older homes.  How do the witnesses propose to address that?<\/p> <p>  I refer also to people who suffer from dementia.  That is a big problem that I find locally.  If one of the people living in a home suffers from dementia, the changes that have to take place, which I know are done through the housing adaptation grant in some cases, concern downstairs facilities such as toilet and shower facilities, and there is the expectation that might be done more quickly.  While I welcome the increase of 11% in the housing adaptation grants, the problem is at the local authority end of the business.  Some local authorities do not provide matching funding or enough matching funding in many cases to meet the demands in their communities.<\/p> <p>  I the architects, I think it was, mentioned two or three counties where a proportion of people who are older live for whatever reason, perhaps due to emigration etc.  Can we match up actual need to the moneys that are there?  Is there an index of age related residents and the housing adaptation grants for those counties?  There are inequalities in different counties.  I mentioned that County Louth did not provide the matching funding two years ago because of the county council's debt.  In discussions with the Deportment of Housing, Planning and Local Government last year there was a significant increase in the availability of money.  Once the need is identified, should there not just be a one-stop shop, be it the Department or the local authority, rather than having matching funds?  Unfortunately, it mitigates against people when they cannot get the grant and they have to live for a year with a significant disability with no action being taken because the council has not applied for the funding or does not have enough matching funding to meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  The key thing for me is the Department of Health and keeping people out of long-term care.  More than 22,000 people live in long-term care.  Many of those, I believe, should be living at home.  They are not living at home because the facilities and community network are not there.  In respect of proposals and research, I refer to the Great Northern Haven in Dundalk where a lot more technology is being put in.  Obviously, that is a new build. The technology helps people when they get out of bed at night, when the light goes on in the bathroom, when they are reminded that water is spilling out of the basin or whatever.<\/p><p>When they leave the window open in the middle of winter, they know it is open.  How much of that technology is in our plans?  How can it be adapted and what key elements can be put into existing homes?  Not everybody will be able to move into a state-of-the-art home right now.<\/p><p> Local authorities had a policy in the past of building perhaps 200 houses in the community that might be some distance from town centres, shops and facilities.  There might be six, seven or eight older persons' dwellings, OPDs, in an area where they are squeezed in and very badly placed.  They are often subject to vandalism and the actions of young people who might be out of control and causing problems for people in those sorts of neighbourhoods.  I support mixed residential areas but the problem is having OPDs far away from facilities.  I agree with the analysis by the architect who spoke about building in existing infill sites in the centre of towns or cities.  We should maximise that and zone such areas specifically for older people's residences.  Nobody else should be allowed to use those sites for any activity.  There would be connectivity with nearby shops and services.  I welcome the advances that are being made but we are not doing enough.  I welcome the reports and preparation to deal with the issues identified by other speakers.<\/p><p> I am seeing increasing examples of dementia in my community and there is a lack of ability of family members to cater for those who are affected.  This is an illness that brings significant problems for people living in housing on their own.  I have met families where a person with dementia is mobile 24-7 in a house.  The person is up and down the stairs and usually never rests, so the families are exhausted in trying to look after that person.  I say this to the architects more than anybody else.  Is this an issue?  Are there dementia-friendly environments so we can adapt homes to make them more accessible?  When a diagnosis is given, there should be a fast track for people to change their downstairs bathrooms, for example, or whatever they will need.  There should be adjustments to the home to help the other people living in the house to care for the affected person.  I would not underestimate the importance of what I am saying about dementia.  I do not know if other public representatives have the same findings but I am finding increasing instances of it.  When I speak to older people they mention that there are not as many heart attacks as there have been, cancer remains a big killer but, more frequently, dementia is coming up.  I will leave it with the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#N00600","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I have been involved in Drogheda with dementia care.

There are three levels of housing for the aged.  There is independent living, independent living with care and dependent living.  The big problem at present is that we do not have enough one and two bedroom apartments for independent living, let alone for independent living with care.  The standard apartments we design and build at present satisfy Part M.  They satisfy two ends of the spectrum, the starter home and the downsizer, as long as the downsizer is independent living.  However, we do not have enough.  There are plenty of family houses that are not adapted for older living but we have a huge shortage of one and two bedroom accommodation which allows for communal living and facilitates the mixed tenure communities one is trying to create.  The level after that is how one adapts that type of housing for the housing with care.  That is quite easy to do and relatively inexpensive if we apply the current Part M and other regulations.  It is when dealing with highly specialised dependent care that there is a need to look at sheltered housing and so forth.  Unfortunately, at present, the only example we have of housing for the aged is the sheltered, highly specialised care type.

Currently, there are approximately 55,000 people in Ireland living with dementia and approximately 4,000 new cases per annum.  One can see where this is going in the future given that we have an ageing demographic.  Interestingly, this year a new model of residential care, called CareBright, opened in Bruff.  It is specifically aimed at dementia.  It is not quite a nursing home and not quite independent living.  It is almost in between.  It is largely based on models designed in the Netherlands and has been brought here as a testing model.  It opened at the beginning of March, so it will be interesting to watch how that develops and to see what it brings to the table in terms of a particular model for dementia, which is particularly challenging.<\/p> <p>  From the Department of Health's perspective, we published the national dementia strategy in 2014.  As part of that work we have introduced intensive home care packages for dementia largely on a trial basis.  We are supporting 150 people at present.  These are very intensive packages that allow people with dementia to try to live at home for as long as possible.  They are also being independently evaluated by Genio in NUI Galway to try to understand their effectiveness and whether they are something we can pursue in the future in a more mainstream model.

Thankfully, she moved from an isolated rural house to a house in the middle of Athy and therefore lived within 500 metres of the town square, the church and all other amenities.  She was also in a small community which looked after her.  The housing unit helped, as did the support of the community.  That is extraordinarily important in terms of how we move forward.

It may take a policy of saying there will be a grant of &euro;50,000 to &euro;75,000, but I would have thought - I am not involved with the Department - a sum of that figure would be needed to actually persuade people to do it, rather than saying they can avail of a capital grant which they will receive in the next five to ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tynan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank each of the delegates for his and her contribution.

I want to focus on the supply of houses and what we can do to plan suitable housing for the age cohorts.  I have specific questions for the Department of Health that are related to the housing adaptation grants scheme.  How does the HSE prioritise applications for housing adaptation grants based on need?  We have all come across people who remain in hospital because their home has not been adapted and they cannot be discharged.  If the medical need has been identified in so far as the patient cannot be discharged because works such as the installation of a shower or wetroom or whatever else may be required in the home have not been undertaken, it does not make any sense to me that a direction is not being given for the work to be done.  The Department of Health will probably need the assistance of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to do that, but we should look at this solution and actually do it. <\/p> <p>  I wish to elicit information from the HSE on occupational therapy reports.  What is the average turnaround time to process a needs assessment or an occupational therapy report?  Again, to avail of a housing adaptation grant, that is required.  The occupational therapist needs to go into a house to see what is needed to allow Mr. Darragh O'Brien to be discharged from hospital and live independently.  The position varies from county to county and also from area to area in a local authority.  If we want to do some practical things, without the need for a conference or the relaunch of a programme, let us see what we can do on the ground.  Does either Mr. Redmond or Ms Spillane believe we have sufficient occupational therapists in each area in an ageing Ireland to process all of the work required?  Is there another way to do it?  Could it be done privately and paid for by the Department or do we have to wait for HSE-appointed occupational therapists to complete the reports?  I know that this is a major problem.  <\/p> <p>  I was very glad when Mr. Tynan mentioned, on behalf of Mr. O'Mahony, that \"downsizing\" was not a bad word.  It has become a bad word because of the hamfisted way in which housing for the elderly has been approached in some, but not all, instances, particularly when people are described as bed blockers which makes them feel bad about being in hospital or when the Government makes announcements that there are 900,000 more family homes than families which make elderly people or those in the seniors category feel that they should be getting out of the family home, the house for which they have paid.  One of the reasons 89% of people want to remain in their own home is there are no alternatives.  If there were alternatives and choices, people would look at the options.  I speak for my own parents, seniors who have recently downsized.  It was not a bad word for them.  It has actually made a lot of sense for them.  <\/p> <p>  Before I turn my attention to the contributions of the Departments of Health and Housing, Planning and Local Government, in its contribution the RIAI stated: \"However there are no options for those who are above the financial thresholds to access social housing but who do not have sufficient means to support their older age accommodation needs\".<\/p><p>That is blindingly clear to everyone.  What would the representatives from the RIAI do to address that problem?  Would they insist on it being provided for in development plans by local authorities?  <\/p><p> Mixed unit developments are of importance.  Where is it being done well?  I have seen a couple of places where it has been done well.  The apartments in those schemes have not been designated specifically for elderly people and I do not think that should be the case.  There should be a mix of duplexes, semi-detached houses and apartments in open settings which allow people to see others.  I am fortunate to know of such areas and the developments work very well.  Having a community mix is also of great importance.  What three things do the representatives from the RIAI think are doable relatively quickly?<\/p><p> I thank Ms Hurley for her statement.  I am struck by the fact that the delivery of social housing and housing for the elderly is very important and may be the focus of the Department.  There was discussion of a couple of semi-independent living schemes.  On the housing mix in local authority or social housing estates, is the Department setting the mix to be used in new estates being delivered?  I know of such estates in my area of Fingal.  Is the Department stating 10% or 15% of units are to be set aside and that it will design them for life such that they can be used by young families, elderly people or those in the middle?  What directions is it giving through the planning and possibly building control elements and also to approved housing bodies?  I have seen a couple of magnificent schemes delivered by the St. Vincent de Paul housing trust.  One such scheme in my town of Malahide, St. Benedict's, is being extended.  Is the Department aware of the level of demand for the extra 16 units?  There are hundreds of people looking for them.  That puts the housing association and the local authority in a difficult position where they will have to make a Solomon's choice between persons who are desperate to access housing.  What do the delegates think we should be delivering per annum and how does it compare to the actual targets set?<\/p><p> Ms Hurley mentioned the joint statement, which is important.  Without giving us a sneak preview, what will it state?  What is the Department's objective in real terms and will it be backed up by policy?  I am sure a report will accompany the statement.  Reports are welcome, but more important are the actions contained therein.  I am jumping back and forth, but I will try to stay within the five minutes allocated to me.<\/p><p> In terms of the HSE's perspective, does the Department have statistics for the numbers of elderly people in inappropriate accommodation such as long-stay or other beds in hospitals because their homes are not appropriate for them or they are waiting for occupational therapy reports to receive housing adaptation grants?  Does the Department track that information for each local authority such that it can identify what the council in, for example, Fingal or Roscommon is doing, what the turnaround time is and how it can be driven through?  Like Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, it is welcome that &euro;62 million has been made available, an increase of 11%, but what are we getting for it?  Is the service improving?<\/p><p> Is there a local authority to which Ms Hurley would look in terms of best practice in the provision of private and public housing?  Will Mr. Tynan and Mr. O'Mahoney also offer their views in that regard?  There probably is not; there is not.  Perhaps the delegates might identify the best of a bad bunch, without being unfair to anyone.  I do not wish to be unfair and did not mean my last comment.  Where is there a better focus on trying to deliver a proper housing mix?<\/p><p> The delegates have provided figures for increased densities in existing areas and making them into communities.  There is a role for local and other politicians in that regard because if one tries to increase densities anywhere, there will be a furore among existing residents who will say it cannot happen because a lovely field would be lost or they like the car park or because of some other issue.  It is about having a proper mix and people getting real.<\/p><p>Like every aspect of housing, these are ticking time bombs.  I hate to say this two weeks in a row, but they are.  We can, however, deal with this with proper planning and design.  I would love to know if the Department is instructing local authorities for private developments.  We have to be able to look for more mixed developments and more whole of life developments.  Are we going to instruct the local authorities by way of planning guidelines for when they put together their local development plans and their planning bibles to say \"this is what you must do\"?  The private sector will have a major role in this.  The Department will not solve it by delivery of social housing.  There are people who have already paid for their three or four bedroom family home who do not want to be there anymore.  They will stay there, however, because there is nowhere else for them to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#R00200","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I will respond first to the Deputy's initial question on occupational therapists.

That whole point about mixed community is really critical.  I refer to one of the areas we have been looking at, particularly since apartments are moving outside the range of affordability.  The studies of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and of Department have shown that it is proving very difficult to try to bring traditional apartments - core, served apartments - down to a level where they fall within the affordability range so we have been looking at is other models.   When one looks at density, currently there are densities that are as low as 20 to 25 per hectare, the old traditional eight to ten to the acre jobs.  Then one has the 150, the typical apartment.  What we have been working on is a model that bridges that and Ms Neary referred to this a few times and is aware of this.<\/p> <p>  What we have been doing is building up models of walk-up apartments which are three or four storeys high that effectively treble the traditional density; that provide one and two bed apartments and surface car parking; that minimise the amount of service and maintained elements that one needs; and that minimises the amount of managed space so all the while trying to keep it as efficient, as easy and as economical to build as is possible.  We have been pricing those models and we find that they fall right into the affordability level.<\/p> <p>  There is very good scheme, which was carried out in 2004 and which would need adapted.  To me it was the perfect model of how one uses public land and private developers to deliver an affordable model of housing.  It was carried out in Ballyfermot on Dublin City Council land.  There was a competition, the rules of which were: to provide affordable housing at the same cost as traditional housing and apartments, with no underground parking and surface parking only; to use modern methods of construction; to be built as quickly as possible; to cover as wide a need as possible;  to be sold within the community at a fixed price which would be less than the market; that there would be a clawback; that no developers or investors would be allowed to buy into the scheme; and that the developer would build it and give back 30% as social housing.  One effectively had 30% social housing, and the balance was affordable housing.  This model worked and 375 units were completed.  The density was close to 95 per hectare.  It was sold out, although there was a high demand at the time.  The developer made a profit, the council got its housing back in return, and it was an exceptionally successful scheme.<\/p> <p>  We are again seeing that as a model for a public private partnerships, PPP, delivery system.  Unfortunately, what we find is that local authorities are really well-intentioned but delivery is highly bureaucratic and even housing architects in our local authorities are tearing their hair out because the delivery programmes are so slow.  We could mix and develop both, bring in the efficiencies of the private sector and deliver on the public sector land bank.  It would not have to be sold on either in that it could be leased on.  Why give it up if one can come up with a leasing model that allows one to get a long-term value back on one's land while delivering affordable housing?<\/p><p>We have asked for the system we are currently looking at to be priced.  We are doing this with one of the large contracting companies.  The idea we are trying to fix is that one of these properties can be built for the same price as a domestic house.  It works.  We have got the prices back.  We are looking to develop that.  We are looking at models like new suburbs with no traditional housing that start with the intermediate model of housing before going to the higher densities.  Given that we have 900,000 family houses, as has been mentioned, why should we be building more?<\/p><p> One of the difficulties we have is in convincing the private market to stop building houses.  It is easy for financial institutions to provide short-term funding for developments that are sold in phases because they get their money back quickly, and Bob's your uncle.  The problem is how to convince them that there is a market for other types of property.  It is starting to happen.  I know of a developer who was building duplexes as an add-on because he had to achieve a certain density.  In order to get up to the minimum density, he threw in a few duplexes.  The duplexes walked out the door so quickly that his mind was changed.  It is a case of changing attitudes.  One bedroom and two bedroom properties satisfy both markets.  They satisfy first-time house buyers and they also satisfy the independent living requirements.<\/p><p> I want to make the point that this is about places as well as homes.  We have spoken about how towns, villages and suburbs can be adapted.  Suburbs need to be densified.  Local authorities have to identify where that densification will take place.  Now that we have the 2040 framework plan, the next thing is to look at where we densify and how we achieve densification.  It is like a softening-up process.  People are going to have to accept densification.  It is a question of where it is going to happen.  Local authorities can start looking at that now.  They can start the process of convincing local populations of what those changes are going to have to be.<\/p><p> I would like to explain the idea behind the urban design toolkit that is being developed by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  The toolkit will be offered as an award within the Tidy Towns competition to a town that wants to participate.  Architects will engage with particular villages and towns that will be selected to develop plans for how to improve the public realm by adapting it for older people, etc.  The aim of this approach is to start to convince people that design is not just about the house one lives in - it is also about the place one lives in.  That toolkit is going to be available to everybody.  It will probably be available this summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

Deputy O'Dowd raised the issue of local authorities providing 20% of funding for the scheme.  However, that a local authority has incurred debt as a result of purchasing land that is probably still lying vacant is not a reason for people in need of the scheme to suffer.  There must be some wriggle room.  Although I buy into the local contribution, it is not good enough that citizens suffer as a result.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the scheme is being abused.  It should be far more uniform.  Local authorities that are not drawing down and spending their allocation should be asked to justify that.  It should be properly audited and transparent and published.<\/p> <p>  The scheme is being abused by some members of the public.  I know of several applications to the scheme involving elderly persons who are on the verge of passing away or going into a nursing home.  I mean no disrespect to them.  Their families draw down money from the scheme and upgrade the property, thus increasing its value.  The elderly person then goes into a nursing home and we discover that the property is rented out.  In other cases, sadly, the person passes away and the taxpayer has pumped &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 into a property and upped its value.  The person has died and there is no recourse.  I gave the Minister a position paper 12 months ago to which I have received no reply, wherein I stated that there should be some sort of safeguard on a 60-month basis whereby if a person passes away within a year of benefiting from the scheme there would be a clawback of 50% of the moneys allocated under the scheme if the property is sold or rented.  That would reduce to 40% in year 2 and continue to reduce annually such that after five years there would be no liability.  More people would benefit if there were safeguards in place to ensure that those who should not benefit from the scheme do not do so inadvertently.  <\/p> <p>  It annoys me more that the Department accepts the word of local authorities in respect of the scheme.  As I understand it, a person applies to the scheme and an inspector or engineer then visits the property.<\/p><p>He or she inspects the work, says what needs to be done and then allocates the jobs.  They go into a queuing system and the work is done.  Possibly the same inspector or an engineer comes out to inspect the work and says, \"Yes, it has been done.\"  Does the Department at any stage cross-reference or perhaps take a sample of 5% of the grants allocated?  Do its officials go to see if the work has actually been done in an appropriate way, from its perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#X01100","speaker":"1416","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#Y00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I must leave the meeting, but I am quite happy for someone else to ask questions.

Realistically, in the intervening period all we have for older people is the housing adaptation grant or some funding from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Does the &euro;66 million come from the Department or from the Department and local authorities?<\/p> <p>  Sometimes there is a need for flexibility in the schemes.  I refer to a specific SEAI scheme.  An elderly couple in their 80s have come to my office on a nearly monthly basis to see if there are upgrades available.  As they live in a terraced house, they do not qualify for the wraparound insulation scheme, even though they should.  There is no flexibility in any scheme to allow this to happen.  Many older people do not even know that there are housing assistance grants for older people available.  I do not know how we get to the people who need these grants and are not aware that they are available to them.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made last week to universal design.  The potential cost of having a universal design for a new build is an additional 3%.  What element of Part M would the delegates change in the building regulations?  I am aware that it is very trendy to have wetrooms and that everybody is putting them in.  We must all have a walk-in, if not a drive-in, shower, yet they are the very things older people need.  Is it fair to say we should incorporate this feature into Part M of the building regulations?<\/p> <p>  A statement was made that 85% of us wanted to stay at home when we were older.  I can understand that.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien made the point well when he said it was because there was no alternative for us.  The only option is to stay at home.  People also want to live in communities.  If we were to provide the right community and the right facilities within it, people might be willing to downsize or move out.  They would not see it as a negative.  In County Wicklow in the 1980s we looked at this matter more than we do now.  Carnew Community Care centre provides 28 homes with independent living.  There is also a day care centre attached to the facility.  Crinion Park was built in Wicklow town beside the old health board building.  Back then we were planning for older people better than we do now.  People living in these areas want to move into such facilities when they see how well they actually work.  They do not see a move into them as a negative.  We could do more in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  I might come back in to make one or two more points later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#Y00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin want to come in on a number of the questions asked?

I do not mind waiting until the end because the discussion has been very interesting.  <\/p> <p>  I appreciate that part of Ms Hurley and Ms Spillane's job is to present the best possible picture of what their Departments are doing.  I am also aware that they are extremely limited by resources.  The reality, however, for many older people in almost all of our constituencies is very different from what the delegates have presented.  Part of the problem is - a little like the position in the provision of accommodation for Travellers and people with disabilities - that older people are left as a peripheral element of the discussion.  The fact that two years into the term of the committee we are only having these dedicated discussions thanks to the Chairman's initiative shows that, as a committee, we are as guilty of not fully integrating the issue into the overall discussion on housing policy as the local authorities and the Departments.<\/p><p>The fact that Focus Ireland had to launch a campaign last week highlighting a 40% increase in older persons' homelessness proves that point.  Probably more shocking than the 40% increase is that we are only talking about 119 people.  The idea that we cannot find housing solutions quickly for those 119 people is probably more of a scandal than the fact that it has increased by 40%.<\/p><p> The Chair's proposal that we have these hearings and prepare this report is timely.  As social and private housing delivery ramps up, albeit not as fast as I would like but at least it is moving in the right direction, now is the time for us to put in some more substantive solutions and get it right to ensure we are not here in a decade's time or more having the same conversations.  <\/p><p> I direct my questions, first, to Ms Frances Spillane of the Department of Health.  Will she elaborate on the funding for home care teams both in terms of total allocation of funding and funding versus the demand?  We all know there are very significant demands that are not being met.  Does she have figures for the number of delayed discharges that are a result of the lack of sufficient home care packages?  Those figures would be interesting.  Will she indicate, from the HSE and the Department of Health's budget, cost comparisons between nursing home settings versus supported housing?  I presume supported housing, in terms of year costs, are significantly cheaper.  If she has figures on that, I would appreciate them.<\/p><p> I am not convinced there is very much co-ordination at local authority, HSE and community care regional level in the way we manage the bricks and mortar element, the community element that the local authority does, and the care packages and support for independent living for older people.  Are there protocols in place.?   How do we ensure at a departmental level that whatever the policy is at the macro level, it is feeding down to the practice on the ground?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#Y00800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524567600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Moving on to the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I do not want to go too much into the adaptation grants because in some senses part of the Chair's report will be about much bigger items than that.  The amount of &euro;60 million odd is nowhere close to the demand that exists.  In my local authority, and we are not unique in this, one can have to wait for a year to be processed and for two to three years for the adaptations to be put in place.  Those are for cases where is a clear and evident medical need for the adaptations.  The process is far too cumbersome.  On the eligibility criteria, the hiking of the age up to 65 is unjustifiable.  I know that is a political decision, not a departmental one, but that urgently needs to be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  The occupational therapists' reports highlight a remarkable situation.  For example, in the South Dublin County Council area where I live, half of the county council is in HSE area 6 and the other half is in HSE area 7.  In HSE area 6, the HSE covers the cost of the occupational therapist's reports for council tenants.  In HSE area 7, the HSE does not have the staff and has not had for many years.  The cost used to be covered by the local authority and it is now covered by the council tenant.  We have a bizarre situation where, depending on which side of the Naas Road a person lives, he or she either has to pay for it himself or herself and is never reimbursed if that person is a council tenant or the HSE provides for it.  To what extent is that lack of consistency prevalent throughout the country?  That is not only an academic matter.  I know of cases where people with significant adaptation needs, including older people but also people looking for the disability adaptation grants, have had their application delayed for a year or more because they have not been able to scrape together the money to cover the cost of the occupational therapist's report.  In all of those cases, there is a need, notwithstanding the comments of my Seanad colleague before he left, to review the scheme again and, in light of increased fiscal space in the budget for next year, to revisit some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  A pertinent point was made by some of the older persons' advocacy organisations last week about the scheme, which point I believe needs to be mentioned, namely, that a person applies for it at the point of crisis.  Somebody has a crisis, urgently needs adaptations and only then gets into the system.  I appreciate that is because there was limited funding, but we need to move to a position where there must be some mechanism for trying to future plan to a greater extent and ask if something else can be put in place.  Rather than waiting until someone has gone for an operation and they are discharged needing significant mobility adaptions for which they have to wait a year, two years or three years, something could be put in place for that person in advance.<\/p> <p>  On the bigger ticket items, I have a concern that local authorities in their social housing construction pipeline are not paying adequate regard to the need for a supply of accommodation for older people.  I do not believe the Department should set targets but it should expect the local authorities to demonstrate clearly that they have that planned not just with respect to individual projects but also their overall social housing construction pipeline.  If that is happening, the officials might give us more information about that.<\/p><p>When I sat on a council, however, and it is a council that has a better record than some, it was never part of our discussions on the social housing programme at that stage, so that needs to be examined.<\/p><p> On underprovision of units for singles, to what extent in the social housing construction pipeline are local authorities being asked to come forward and demonstrate provision for singles?  One third of the South Dublin County Council waiting list is for singles but there is no corresponding one third of the units in the social housing construction pipeline for singles.  When I refer to singles I mean units for single persons or a couple household that does not need a second bedroom.  That is crucial.<\/p><p> \"Downsizing\" is not a bad word.  I have a list as long as my two arms of council tenants who are desperate to downsize.  They would love a bungalow in the housing estate in which they live or nearby, which would free up a three bedroom family home for a family on the housing waiting list or in emergency accommodation, but they are just not available.  I am aware that some dormer bungalows are beginning to be included in the social housing construction pipeline but it is nowhere close to what is required.<\/p><p> Universal design is probably one of the big issues we will examine in the report.  While we can fix the other problems in terms of the stock we have, if we are not more ambitious in the requirements for both the public and private sectors in the new housing that will be developed, we will not fix the problem in the long term.  In terms of the Department, will the witness tell us what type of discussions are happening about mainstreaming universal design into planning guidelines?  I am acutely aware that there will be a need, not just in terms of the county development plans but also given that there will be strategic housing developments, for central Government guidelines to ensure anything that goes straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is captured.  Has the Department started discussing the potential cost implications?  One of the people who made a presentation to the committee last week said that it could add approximately 3% to the overall construction price of the house.  How can we manage that in a way that it does not prevent producing the right type of guidelines?<\/p><p> Then there are older renters.  We are seeing an increasing number of people renting at a later stage in their lives.  Part of the difficulty is that people might have an income that puts them over the threshold for the housing assistance payment, for example, and social housing eligibility, but they know that in five years they will be out of work and on a small occupational pension or the State pension and eligible for social housing.  People can only join the list at that point and the list could be five to seven years for older persons' accommodation.  Is there any attempt to look at that?<\/p><p> Will Mr. O'Mahony and Mr. Tynan give their thoughts on universal design?  I am aware it is a spectrum and can be a range of things, but what would they like to see the committee highlight in the report it will produce in terms of the key game-changing policies the Government could introduce with regard to universal design?  What would be in it?  Should it be in the county development plan or in central Government guidelines?  Do they have any thoughts on cost and cost implications?  I was struck by Mr. Tynan's comments on housing typologies in private developments.  Perhaps he could tell us a little more about those and how he thinks we can achieve them.<\/p><p> We hope to produce a report that will contain many recommendations.  If there are a small number of recommendations the witnesses think we could make, what would be their top two or three?  I would invite the Department's officials to give their top two or three but they might not be at liberty to tell us what they would like to see change in Government policy.  However, they could send it anonymously to the Chairman by email or somehow at a later stage and we will be happy to see it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#Z00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524567600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the housing adaptation and social housing issues the Deputy raised and Ms Neary will talk about universal design, what we have done to date in that regard in some of the social housing developments we have been involved with and also in terms of our engagement into the future.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the housing adaptation grants, we have seen a year-on-year increase of 1,000 grants.

We have issued guidelines on it and more streamlined, single forms will be issued shortly.  We have worked with Inclusion Ireland on their design because we recognise that forms can be very difficult at the best of times but for people in their later years, they can be especially daunting.  Work has been done on the forms and guidelines have been issued to the local authorities, which should improve the consistency of the scheme.

We are talking about one or two-bedroom units or about two-bedroom units for three people, rather than two-bedroom units for four people, for example.

It is not a matter of one size fits all.  <\/p><p> The National Disability Authority, under the national disability inclusion strategy 2017 to 2021, has been assigned the task of considering universal design solutions for new houses and will make an impact assessment.

We work very closely with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, and the 'Smart Ageing' competition that we ran last year was based on the principles of universal design.  Rather than be absolute in meeting the definition, we have always supported the principles and tried to incorporate them as much as possible.

Within the private sector housing developers want to identify the widest market possible.  Nowadays wetrooms, low profile and accessible showers are becoming almost standard elements of the interior design of apartments.  There is also wheelchair accessibility.  There has been a huge improvement.  Retrofitting is the area that really needs investment, when we consider the number of houses that are not adaptable.  That is why the Abhaile project which won the award last year was very interesting.  It was predicated on the simple idea that a typical three-bedroom semi-detached house, that one could walk around blindfold in most parts of the country, could be adapted to two units which could create an income for an older person whose only asset was their home.  It allows for an element of community because there is contact with the other person in the house, produces an income and allows for adapting access to the house.  The cost is &euro;50,000.  Grant-aiding that work would be of huge benefit.<\/p><p>If a person is on a limited income even &euro;50,000 it is going to be tricky.  Perhaps a way could be identified of grant aiding that element of it.  When the &euro;14,000 tax-free income that is allowed for renting a room is taken into account, suddenly it starts to look like a very attractive option.  That also helps to increase the density in our suburbs in a very simple way.  Mr. Tynan will refer to exemplars, and I keep going back to the big picture.  We have been warned now and we know it is coming.  We know that by 2050, Ireland could have a population of 6.5 million people, 25% of whom will be a huge demographic of 65 year olds.<\/p><p> When we as architects identify density, it is units per hectare.  This is a blunt instrument because units per hectare does not mean anything, it does not look at the demographic and it does not define the real housing need.  With private development especially, we have to start forcing the issue that it is not suitable just to provide family houses in a development.  It may not suit the demographic.  Developers must do demographic studies.  We do this for retail and other elements when we apply for planning permissions.  We should look carefully at who we are building for and if it satisfies the demographic in the area.  Is a suburb with predominantly three and four bedroom apartments a sustainable way of developing housing?  It probably is not.  The issue can be forced and the densities can be forced to increase so that appropriate housing can be provided that is more suited to starter homes and older people as well as families.  This leads to the issue of family-sized apartments.  The solution lies in higher density development.  The vision, the look, the scale and the size are going to be completely different.  As architects we can demonstrate this and show what it is going to be like.  In some respects it can be very advantageous and a much more well-adapted suburb with better and more high-use facilities.  It can keep the population close.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Mahony believe that the demographic studies should be a planning requirement or a planning requirement for developments of a certain size?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#DD00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Yes.

I can give the committee a snapshot as it homes in on what has been said here.  The study looked at 10,500 adults aged over 55 and their attitudes to future housing options.  A total of 30% of people in the study said they were positive about moving towards an adapted housing type such as housing with care style models.

As a practice that now does more student accommodation than we would like to and which does not do the 40% of social housing that was our business back in 2008 and 2009, we are well aware of the requirements under the variation of the development plan to quantify the percentage of student accommodation in any particular area.  That is part of a planning application and it is very easy to put that in place.  Likewise, one could have the regulation where it is stated that the developer must advance the issue of housing for older people.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O'Mahony has said, it is an issue of demographic change.  This is true for smaller units, be it for general mainstream housing or housing for older people.  This is where the challenge is.  Whether this is for 100 units per hectare, which I would call the \"missing middle\" where we would have to increase that density, or for larger schemes, we have to look at the models and develop those.  The Netherlands has been far better than the UK in this regard.  I recently came across the Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation, HAPPI, which the committee may have heard of.  It is five or six years old and is a series of exemplars of Dutch, Swiss and German principles for smaller unit, higher density five and six storey accommodation.  I believe this is where we need to be.  The difficulty is that the bungalow model will not work as we go forward.  We have to look at encouraging and incentivising people into larger-scale buildings that can accommodate their needs and which are adaptable, in response to the Part M regulations.  In the majority of cases, what we are building now is suitable for people of reasonable mobility as distinct from people who need specialised care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#EE00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Tynan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>We now have three people left to ask questions.

I lived there for nine years.  It strikes me, having lived there, that its methodology for densities is incredible.  The problem here is cultural.  We are used to older people living in their family homes and it is no longer smart living.  It is inefficient in many senses.  It is not efficient to adapt the house because it is three bedroom and maybe one person is living there.  What communication mechanisms does the Department have in place?  What the witnesses have identified here is clear, that we need to change the way we do business with regard to housing for older people in Ireland and housing in general.  The models are there in other countries.  What is the Department doing to inform older people of the options?  The witnesses identified that if older people are provided with options, they may consider it.  How will we do that cultural shift to help people to go into secure, proper, energy-efficient housing?  If we do not communicate the message to older people, we will keep coming up against friction.  The point is to help and empower older people to make good choices about housing.<\/p> <p>  How do we support families who support older people?  This issue of housing for older people is not just about the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Health but also the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In the Netherlands, when an area is being developed, the infrastructure, such as roads networks, is developed first and the housing often goes in afterwards.  Here in Ireland, older people have reduced mobility when walking and have difficulties going to services and supermarkets.  We have a real problem with overall support for older people.  Housing is part of that but we have to give the older people the chance to live in their communities.  We identified living in the community as important.  To access services of libraries, supermarkets and community centres, they need to be able to get around, both inside and outside of their houses and to access services.  How are we doing that?  How are the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Department of Health supporting people to live decent and fulfilled lives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#FF00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I was late coming in but I too want to agree with previous speakers.  My concern relates to all the Departments.  The lack of housing for elderly people is a massive issue.  We speak here about all the funding that is meant to be there but it is not there.  The grants to local authorities include housing aid for older people and adaptation grants.  Grant money is given out at the beginning of the year.  Many people apply and are disappointed because they get letters back to say that there is no funding there for the grant.  One has to reapply the following year.  One cannot leave one's file in and have it there as a priority.  One is told that there is no funding and to apply again.  That is unacceptable.  I know people waiting for grants who have died.  It is uncalled for, there is no joined-up thinking and I am concerned about it.<\/p><p>The other issue is the age change from 60 to 65 without local authorities knowing.  That is massive.  That six-year gap is crucial for an elderly person to get work done.  The maximum grant, as the witnesses know, is &euro;30,000.  Those are all means-tested.  When a grant is means-tested, all the income is taken into account.  Therefore, the highest grant I have seen in my years as a councillor and now a Senator would be &euro;16,000 to &euro;17,000.  I have never seen the maximum grant given out for any housing aid for the elderly or adaptation grant.  One submits a figure and a builder will come back with a quote.  There were four cases in my clinic yesterday where people had got the grant.  They have been given maybe &euro;14,000 but the builder had given a quote of &euro;22,000.  They are falling between the stools because they are not able to get the work done and they are losing the grant.  Nobody is helping them.  There is nowhere they can go.  I have put in appeals.<\/p><p> I have another concern.  I presume there is an occupational therapist in most local authorities, as there is in my own, who works through the local authority in a private capacity.  Occupational therapists do not work for the local authority but are given a grant to assess a person's situation.  There are many grants which the occupational therapist has not approved and many appeals have gone back in through the doctor.  There are cases where the occupational therapist has said what is recommended and I have had a man or woman come back to me.  I have said it is not good enough and to go to a doctor and that the doctor needs to appeal.  I feel that I am in an appeal system the whole time.  A doctor can seemingly overrule an occupational therapist, and rightly so.  I am not saying anything bad about the occupational therapists as I am sure they are doing their jobs.  They only give a certain amount then doctors come in.  I put in appeal after appeal.  People may need to go back to doctors and get another assessment from them and work with the occupational therapist.  The situation is unacceptable and should be examined.<\/p><p> Quality of life is crucial for the elderly.  I know through the HSE and the councils that it is important.  I believe there is a system for stove installation in some local authorities.  In the past year, the biggest number of queries I have had from the elderly relate to stoves.  People find them safe if they have to go out for a message or such.  Even with medicals - I am going in with doctors' letters - there is no money for stoves.  Can the witnesses work together and put a system together for elderly people where there is a grant scheme for stoves?  I am told that it goes back to local authorities which then say there is no money there.<\/p><p> It is a nightmare if one is looking for windows and doors for the elderly because there is no money.  People are living longer but funding is not being provided for grants.  That is a major problem.  I want to talk about the HSE.  The HSE would originally have worked through local authorities.  When one gets a grant, whether for a chair for the shower or if one has an elderly person who is looking for a walking aid or such, one has to go back to the nurse or doctor.  Years ago, with local authorities, the HSE had a massive say and the local authorities, with the HSE, would say that a particular lady needed a walking aid.  The other day, I was trying to get a ball for a lady for her hand as she has arthritis.  I have to go back to the nurse then to the doctor.  These are simple things but there does not seem to be joined-up thinking.  Can the witnesses work together to produce a system, whether for a stairlift, a chair for a shower, a walking aid, a ramp or rail?  The timescale is not working.  If the funding is gone at the beginning of the year, and one does not get in quickly, then one is left to the following year and has to reapply.  There is even a system in the HSE which is letting elderly people down.  Fair play to the nurses, they are doing a great job.  I am not knocking anyone here.  Maybe the HSE would work more with local authorities to see what could be done.<\/p><p> Recently, two or three elderly people came in to buy their house.  Last year, a new tenant purchase scheme was given to local authorities but an income level of 50% must be met.<\/p><p>I know people who have retired.  They are elderly and have lived in local authority houses all their lives but they do not qualify to buy them.  These people have worked all their lives and have the money but because the 50% income level is not being met, they do not qualify to buy the local authority house.  I do not mean to be critical but there must be joined-up thinking so the elderly can get the chance to buy their houses.  I know there was meant to be a review of the tenant purchase scheme.  The couples coming to me were devastated that they could not buy the house in which they had lived all their lives.  Will the witnesses do something about that?<\/p><p> Overall there must be a full assessment of people in three bedroom or four bedroom houses that need to downsize.  I can understand this is not for everybody but the choice should be given.  Recently I dealt with one or two cases of people in local authority houses that have three bedrooms and they now want properties with one or two bedrooms.  They are being told there is no money to buy them a house.  We have people looking to downsize but there is no programme in place.  Could such a system be put in place?  There is a massive issue with awareness of how people qualify for the fair deal scheme.  People ring my office and I try to help but there must be a programme in place so people can be aware of what they need to do to qualify for the fair deal scheme.  This also applies to families seeking respite, as there is no respite.  People are ringing hospitals and trying to get respite or cataracts removed.  Ultimately, elderly people are being forgotten in certain areas.  Respite is one area where people must wait for months.  I have contacted the Health Service Executive and hospitals and people are in queues because there are no beds.  This must be addressed.<\/p><p> Elderly people might have to wait for up to two and a half years for a cataract operation or even a hospital appointment.  In my area of Carlow and Kilkenny, people have been waiting for over a year just for an appointment.  These are not all elderly people but some of them are.  We need to prioritise the elderly and get the HSE, local authorities and the Department together to form a system where everybody can work together.  I am not being negative but I am dealing with these areas.<\/p><p> I know everybody is doing their best.  Will different programmes be put in place for the rebuilding of houses for elderly people or the system for grant applications?  Will there be a revision to the process of working through the HSE, the nurses and doctors in different areas when people need to access services?  The staff are being put to the pin of their collar but there is not enough time for them.  All of us are here today and it is important that everybody works together so there can be delivery.  I know from dealing with the different Departments that everybody is doing their best.  Funding is a massive issue and unless it is put in the right areas, the whole system will fall.  There must be accountability, as I have said that it is a major issue too.  We need to look at accountability in different areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#FF00500","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524567600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the committee is doing this report collectively.  I brought it to the committee but it has been endorsed as something we can do as a joint committee.  It is not mine, rather it comes from everybody within this committee.  It arose on the back of a weekly programme on Fridays that had a couple of irate panellists who said the Government had some cheek in asking them to give up their homes.  We had to really take it on the chin because although it was not the aim, it came across that way.  We cannot ask people to downsize or move unless there are options for them.  We have a duty to provide solutions or options.<\/p> <p>  If I am being parochial, allow me to go back to social housing for all age groups and not just older people.  There is a difference between \"older\" and \"elderly\".  I am referring to older people who are absolutely not elderly but who might not need a home with three or four bedrooms.  They might want to be in a village or community setting with supports that may be required now or in future.  My local authority sold council houses through the tenant purchase scheme and we reinvested the money into all our social housing stock, retrofitting properties to bring them up to proper energy efficiency with the likes of insulation and new windows, doors, boilers and guttering systems.  We brought them to a certain standard and in turn this meant we could turn over the properties more quickly if tenants moved to a different type of unit.<\/p><p>I know that is not happening in all local authorities but some local authorities such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are very proactive in such matters.  We must give recognition where it is due.  I know Ms Sarah Neary has done much work with building standards and guidelines to bring us where we need to be now.  There has been a massive deficit for nearly 20 years in this respect.  All of a sudden we are trying to get these schemes up and running, having ignored them for decades.  We must recognise that Ms Neary has done much work in the Department on this.<\/p><p> My fear about this process relates to cost.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned a figure of approximately 3% being bandied about last week.  Do the architects see this as a factor?  I am acutely aware that the construction industry is all the time trying to make it more affordable to build or to streamline, whether it is by eliminating lift shafts or parking, but not reducing the standards we now have.  Is the 3% figure a barrier to us developing age-friendly and appropriate homes in mixed tenure developments?  I know we are discussing Part M but the debate has even got down to saddle boards, handrails or handles and walk-in showers in houses or apartments.  Is the 3% a prohibitive factor?<\/p><p> I am reluctant to use the word \"incentivise\" but how can we encourage applications for housing for older people?  We have done it before in other sectors, whether we agree on it or not.  Could there be initiatives such as tax incentives to encourage applications, especially in areas where we know there is a higher population of people over 65?  There is one local authority in Dublin that would have a higher population than the other three.  I do not want to be biased so I will not mention one over the other.  Could we encourage applications so as to give people the choice of downsizing; this could lead to financial security or lessen the burden of cost in heating a larger dwelling while also facilitating family visits or other amenities?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Mahony mentioned planning requirements and possible resistance in this respect.  I get excited when I hear such comments as it means there is something good in this that needs to be pushed.  It might be difficult to deliver but sometimes the harder thing to do is the right thing.  I will be led by the witness on whether a planning requirement is something we should push.  Nothing is insurmountable and if there is a will, there is a way to deliver.<\/p><p> There was mention of particular sites for public private partnerships delivering schemes like this.  I know of four sites with nothing on them right now but with plans somewhere in the ether.  With those we could deliver public private partnerships at the level we need of mixed tenure.  I would like some comments on that.  Would it be a better mechanism for delivering housing for older people, whether in assisted or independent living, or merely within mixed tenure development?  Would it be the best or fastest way of doing it?  Is it a long-term solution or all of the above?  Would the witnesses favour public private partnerships to deliver housing for older people rather than local authorities?  They might not want to answer but I welcome their comments.<\/p><p> The witnesses might have examples of best practice in our European counterparts, although they may not have them here.  Perhaps they could be sent to the committee so we can make informed policy decisions or refer to them when we put together the document.  I know we have gone well over time and I am biased but I have found this really interesting for a long time.  We can put together a lovely glossy document, and there are many in these Houses from all Departments, but there is no point in it sitting on a shelf.  What key actions or recommendations can we put into development plans or national policy so as to encourage and deliver housing for older people across the country but in particular in population areas where it is needed?  I am looking for the key actions.<\/p><p>Like many on this committee, I do not want a glossy document.  I want a return for the time we are giving.  Yes, it is 20 years away, but we have just lost 20 years in this area.  I do not want to lose the next 20 years.  The will is there - cross-party - to deliver housing for older people across the board.  What key actions can we take and how can we implement them in order to get that return?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#HH00200","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I refer to the cost of universal access.  If one can get it early enough and if it is defined clearly enough, then it should cost virtually nothing.  The Part M elements that we already incorporate are the expensive ones, including simple things like the widths of doorways, accessibility and so on.  When it is brought down to a much more defined and specific level, if the specification is there, it can be designed in early.  Retrofitting is where the cost is.  Unfortunately, it goes back to regulation.  The developer works to what is specifically on the page, not maximum or minimum standards.  If one wants to make change, sadly it involves forcing people to accept it.  As we have said so many times, the cost of houses is not the cost of building.  The cost of houses is the other 53%.  There is a recent study by Housing Agency which looked at our costs against four other European countries of equivalent wealth, standard, etc.  Our building costs are pretty well in line with those in France, Germany and the UK.  In fact, we are cheaper than the UK.  This is all about designing in early.<\/p> <p>  I refer to retrofitting.  I am really interested in retrofitting because I went to the Netherlands and I saw this extraordinary retrofitting scheme, where they took a terrace of local authority houses built in the 1950s.  In four days they completely retrofitted a house.  I think it cost &euro;80,000.  A front wall, a back wall and a roof arrived and they were fixed within a day and a half.  Then they went inside and they retrofitted the bathrooms and the kitchens and plugged in a whole new heating system in the back.  They did it all in the space of four days.  They asked all the tenants on the street whether they were going to buy into it.  All of them did, except one who was left out of the scheme.  It was paid back through a long-term rental system where the money was deducted from rent over a payback period of something like ten years.  It was extraordinary.  It was all very carefully designed and the retrofitting brought it up to the standards we are talking about, which is A2.  It is just a thought; there are ways of doing it.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked as to whether public private partnerships, PPPs, were a good idea.  I mentioned one.  For some reason, there may have been a notion that the developer was being aggrandised, which is a political issue as opposed to a factual one.  However, it delivered what it said on the tin.  I think PPPs are the most efficient and effective way, assuming the rules are very clear and it is an open book, so if one is dealing with a developer, everything is on the table.  The profit margins, all the costs and everything should be out in the open, so everybody can see very clearly what is happening.  The difference is the traditional developer can deliver efficiencies that it is very difficult to do under a public tendering system.<\/p> <p>  In the example I mentioned, there was a competition which decided who one would go with.  Having done that, it was possible to define all the elements of that PPP.  I think it is a very good way of doing it.  I am inclined to believe there has to be a better and more effective way of realising the value of land in the long term rather than giving it away just like that and taking the money.  The family jewels should not be given away.  If that can be squared, that is a very good idea.<\/p><p>Dublin City Council has advertised a number of PPPs over the years.  The same land kept coming up and then nothing would happen.  It seemed to founder on the basis of what the PPP format should be.  Therefore, let us look at the effective, efficient ones and the ones that worked.  <\/p><p> We were just saying among ourselves that the whole issue of housing the aged and health issues to do with the aged mean we probably need a Minister for the aged.  If 25% of the population will be over 65, it is so complex and needs such tying together of all the issues, that it probably is deserving of a junior Ministry anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018042400002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524567600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I refer to the question of land development and the PPP model.

Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked about the communication piece which is really important.  In terms of our interaction with the local authority, the framework is set through things like the national planning framework, housing strategies, development plans, guidelines and building regulations.  What will be important for people on the ground and citizens is the strategy and policy statement we will issue because that will set out the different issues around urban renewal, connected living and delivery in centres for older people.  That will be an important communication tool.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the services that are offered, one of the things we always require local authorities to do is to have good information up on their websites.  Through Citizen's Information, people are made aware of the various different grants.  Hopefully, through that mechanism, people will be aware of what they are entitled to, or what is available to them.  When we publish the older persons' policy statement, we would see ourselves doing a lot of work on communicating the different things that are available to people so that they know.  It is important in terms of our work, the work of the Department of Health and the HSE that there is a joined up approach on the ground.  People should hear about what is available through their GP and through the different health services they go through.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken a lot about the delivery and the type of mixed delivery that older people need and want.  The approved housing bodies piece is important in terms of delivery and the type of homes that come through for older persons.  We have seen some very successful schemes where approved housing bodies can give the supports that are required on the ground to those older people.<\/p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of stoves.

It is important to the Department that the works are certified, carried out appropriately and to the required standard.<\/p> <p>  The issue of public private partnerships and land has been raised.
