Before we begin, it is important to comment briefly on the recent events which resulted in the tragic death of a number of people.  In particular, I wish to pay tribute to Garda Tony Golden who was killed in the line of duty while protecting another citizen.  Garda Golden leaves behind a wife and young family and our thoughts and prayers must be with them at this most difficult time.  His actions were selfless and brave.  They are the actions that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage in every day on our behalf.  I also wish Ms Siobh&aacute;n Phillips, who is very ill in hospital, a speedy recovery from her injuries.<\/p> <p>  There was a further tragedy at Carrickmines, where a fire caused the deaths of so many innocent people.
