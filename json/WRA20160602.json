A  95% target of appropriate placement in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Units is indicated in the National Service Plan 2016.

Examples of factors that influence such admissions include the availability of a bed in, or the distance to, the nearest Child and Adolescent Mental Health Unit, the wishes of the young person involved, or the need for an urgent clinical assessment.  While it remains challenging for the HSE to meet this ambitious target, significant progress has been made; there were 95 admissions to adult units in 2015 compared to 247 such admissions in 2008.  It is a priority for the HSE to keep such admissions to a minimum, and this is kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  The  admission of a child or adolescent to an Acute Adult Inpatient Unit is only made following a clinical assessment of the needs of the individual at community level, and in consultation with the HSE Mental Health Directorate.

One of the objectives of the HSE Mental Health Division has been to improve the response of mental health services for individuals in such circumstances.  This includes accommodation and treatment for an individual in the most appropriate setting, relevant to their presenting need.<\/p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government commits to further enhancing 24\/7 service support and liaison teams in primary and emergency care, building on the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan 2016 for this area, including the development and staffing of crisis houses, and enhanced 24\/7 access to specialist services where a psychiatric assessment considers this necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200042#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200042#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[13686\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200042#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he will take to prevent instances of children with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder being held in hospitals under chemical restraint because of problems with the Health Service Executive releasing funding for residential placements.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>I have been advised that individual cases are managed in the most clinically appropriate way for the particular child.

The provision of harm reduction measures, such as needle and syringe programmes and methadone maintenance treatment, reduce drug-related harm and facilitate recovery by providing a pathway into services.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere.  This practice is unhygienic and poses a significant health risk for the drug users themselves and results in discarded needles which present a public health risk to others.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of supervised injecting facilities has been proposed to ameliorate this problem.  The Government has committed to supporting a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drugs use including legislating for supervised injection facilities.<\/p>  <p>  A supervised injecting facility works to prevent injury and death, and connect people with help, by the provision of a supervised space where drug users may self-administer drugs by injection in safer conditions, and where immediate care can be given in the event of overdose.  Unlike other forms of Drug Consumption Rooms, it does not make provision for consumption by other routes of administration, such as smoking.<\/p>  <p>  On the 15 of December 2015, the Government decided to include additional Heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to provide enabling provisions for supervised injecting facilities.  These provisions would enable the Minister for Health to issue licences permitting the establishment of supervised injecting facilities to provide enhanced clinical support to, and mitigate the problem of public injecting by, chronic drug users.<\/p>  <p>  Drafting of the Bill by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is at an advanced stage and, subject to approval by Government, it is anticipated that it will be published in coming months. The Bill and the subsequent Ministerial regulations made thereunder, will allow for the licensing, provision and operation of supervised injecting facilities under specific circumstances, whilst protecting the public health and ensuring that the prohibition on possession and supply of illicit drugs outside of such facilities is adequately maintained.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that initially one supervised injecting facility would be established on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre.  An independent evaluation would be an intrinsic element to this initiative; determining the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  The outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In line with the experience of other countries which have established such facilities, it would be expected that the numbers would be few and the locations carefully selected to address most effectively the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200043#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200043#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[13692\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200043#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the task force on staffing and skill mix for nursing; the status of the pilot of the framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix in general and specialist medical and surgical care settings in adult hospitals in Ireland; the hospitals in which this is being piloted; the timeframe for completing reporting and making recommendations on the pilot; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>In February 2016, the Taskforce on Staffing and Skill Mix for Nursing, developed an Interim Report and Recommendations for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in general and specialist surgical care settings in adult hospitals in Ireland.

In addition, 681 applicants have been issued with decision letters setting out what they must do to progress to the final stage of registration.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI fully recognises the challenges being experienced by health service employers in the public and the private sector and the NMBI is meeting and liaising with employers to address the registration issues.  The NMBI is also liaising with a large number of recruitment agencies on a daily and weekly basis to support the recruitment and registration process.  Senior NMBI staff are also endeavouring to explore the best ways of improving the efficiency of the existing process, whilst still maintaining the standards of education and professional competence required to enable registration.  A new streamlined application form and information booklet was also launched earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Various measures including enhanced website functionality, additional staff appointments and ongoing process improvement work by NMBI staff is assisting in making headway in the management of the increasing volumes of applications received by the NMBI to facilitate new nurses and midwives entering the Irish health system as quickly as possible without compromising standards.<\/p>  <p>  While NMBI has registered 803 nurses and midwives in 2016 to date and issued 681 applicants with  decision letters, there are a further 1,947 applications unable to progress to assessment stage due to incomplete documentation being submitted by applicants who have all been contacted in this regard.  It should be noted that as well as a completed application form, overseas applicants must send in identity documents and arrange for other supporting documents to be sent directly to NMBI.  These include a transcript of their education programme, a certificate confirming registration and good standing as a nurse, as well as a reference from their current or most recent employer.  Only when these documents have been received can the application for registration be assessed.  It is incumbent on recruitment agencies and employers to emphasise to applicants that it is their responsibility to ensure all relevant documents are sent to NMBI.  Since March 1, applicants have six months from the date of application to submit all of their documentation, otherwise their application will be closed.  Previously, applicants had twelve months to submit their documentation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the decision following this assessment may not always be registration.  The outcome can be to seek further information\/clarification from the applicant, to register, to refuse registration, or to advise the applicant they must successfully complete a period of adaptation and assessment as a pre-requisite to registration.  In late 2015, the NMBI approved, on a pilot basis, an aptitude test developed by the RCSI as an alternative option to undergoing a period of adaptation and assessment and this is proving a successful and popular alternative.  NMBI has now approved the initiative for a further two years, which will facilitate 40 applicants to take the test monthly.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the NMBI is working with Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) to explore ways of encouraging the large amount of nurses on the inactive part of the Register in Ireland to recommence practising.

These are adjustments\/payments that will be made to hospitals which are currently operating above the national average price for activity.

The Committee is co-chaired by the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO). <\/p><p>The Committee also functions as Ireland&rsquo;s Intersectoral co-ordinating mechanism for addressing AMR at European level. <\/p><p>The Committee was launched, with Ministerial approval, on European Antibiotic Awareness Day in November 2014 and has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its most recent meeting took place on 13 April 2016. <\/p><p>Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end.  Through membership of the World Health Organisation, Ireland is part of the international effort aimed at tackling the global public health threat of AMR, which requires action across human and animal health sectors, agriculture and the wider environment.<\/p><p>In May 2015 at the WHO 68th World Health Assembly the final WHO Global Action Plan was endorsed; it sets out five strategic objectives:<\/p><p>1. to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;<\/p><p>2. to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;<\/p><p>3. to reduce the incidence of infection;<\/p><p>4. to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents; and<\/p><p>5. develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.<\/p><p>Through adoption of the Global Action Plan, governments committed to have in place, by May 2017, a national action plan on antimicrobial resistance that is aligned with the global action plan.  This national plan will cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health.  The WHO is working with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the Health Assembly in 2017. <\/p><p>The National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee, at its meeting on 13 April last, agreed as a key action for 2016 the development of Ireland&rsquo;s AMR national action plan. <\/p><p>I would also note that the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has in any case been a significant, long-standing patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health for many years. <\/p><p>A wide range of initiatives have been put in place in the Irish health system over several years in response to the rising incidence of AMRs.  These include:<\/p><p>- improved surveillance of infections and prescribing;<\/p><p>- infection prevention and control processes;<\/p><p>- antimicrobial stewardship initiatives; and<\/p><p>- public and professional awareness raising, with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200044#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200044#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[13667\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200044#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"how he will ensure the Health Service Executive recruitment embargo does not impact detrimentally on critical services; what oversight he has on the provision of services impacted by the embargo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>An easing of restrictions on the employment of additional staff was announced in Budget 2015.

Following the development of the Neuro-rehabilitation Policy &amp;amp; Strategy, the Health Service Executive established the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme, to ensure the optimal care pathway for different clinical needs.  The scope of the  Rehabilitation Medicine Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through primary, secondary and tertiary care.  These Programmes provide a national, strategic and coordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  They include the standardization of access to and delivery of, high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally, as well as better linkages with primary care services.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has almost completed the Model of Care for the provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland, which will be the basis for the delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, the HSE Disability Services Division has a role in the provision of Neuro-rehabilitation services, primarily the provision of community based therapy services and personal social services.  As part of the Transforming Lives programme, the programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money &amp;amp; Policy Review of Disability Services, the HSE is focusing on disability funded rehabilitation services to encourage reconfiguration of existing provision through the establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links are being maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the Government announced a major development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital with a commitment of around &euro;40 million.  The new development will deliver a 120 bed ward capacity, including support therapies, paediatric and acquired brain injury wards, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Neuro-rehabilitation services, the Programme for Partnership Government places a particular focus on publishing a plan for advancing Neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.  Currently a steering group led by the Health Service Executive Social Care Division with representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurology, Department of Health, Primary Care, Therapy Professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, has drafted an implementation framework for the National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for Neuro-rehabilitation services, which has been circulated to members of the steering group and stakeholder agencies for consultation.

In order to support additional services being provided by GPs, the IMO, the HSE and the Department of Health also agreed to revisions to the list of special items of GP service.

Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013.  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, in November 2013 the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language.  This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders who reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard, in particular, to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision.  The Group also examined mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and address practical implications for service users.

Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to<\/font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Since the Garda College reopened in September 2014, a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that 30 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR South Garda Division.<\/p><p>It is expected that a further 300 trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.<\/p><p>DMR South Drugs Unit<table><tr><th>31 Dec 2010<\/th><th>31 Dec 2011<\/th><th>31 Dec 2012<\/th><th>31 Dec 2013<\/th><th>31 Dec 2014<\/th><th>31 Dec 2015<\/th><th>31 March 2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>30<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200048#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Visas Data","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200048#WRH01750"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[14050\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200048#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"for a list of all student entry visas, including a brief description of their purpose, and a list of the legislation and regulations which give effect to each visa.","asker":"1231","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that information for students on the INIS website provides guidance on the type of courses which students may pursue in Ireland.

This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the\u00a0Consumer Protection Code and\u00a0the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. <\/p><p>I should add that the Central Bank has updated each of the Codes in order to ensure that Credit Servicing Firms are subject to these Codes directly in their own right.  This has been done for the sake of certainty and transparency, in order to make it explicit that the activity of credit servicing is a regulated activity within the meaning of the Codes and firms carrying out that activity are  regulated entities  in their own right with respect to that activity.\u00a0 As I have previously said, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) were introduced as a prudential policy measure for credit institutions.  Full details of their legal basis were provided\u00a0in the Central Bank's press release which is available here: . <\/p><p>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets applied from March 2013 to December 2014.\u00a0 They had\u00a0applied to ACC Bank plc, Allied Irish Bank plc (including AIB Mortgage Bank, EBS Limited and EBS Mortgage Finance), The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland (including Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank and ICS Building Society), KBC Bank Ireland plc, Permanent Tsb plc and Ulster Bank Ireland Limited with respect to their Republic of Ireland principal dwelling home\/primary residence (PDH ) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgagees.\u00a0 In April 2015, the Central Bank determined that relying on common quarterly solution targets across all banks was no longer appropriate and wrote\u00a0to each bank setting out new requirements.\u00a0<\/p><p>I would reiterate\u00a0that authorised Credit Servicing Firms (including those who have notified the Central Bank that they wish to avail of the transitional arrangements provided for under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015) are required to comply with the requirements of financial services legislation including the Central Banks statutory codes and in particular the CCMA (including as it pertains to matters such as engagement with the borrower).  They are also required to comply with the provisions of other legislation in force in the State as it applies to their activities, including the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200050#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Expenditure","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200050#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[14185\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200050#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"how he calculates spending by local authorities for the purposes of the expenditure benchmark and in the calculation of fiscal space; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>Fiscal space is estimated using the Expenditure Benchmark.\u00a0 The starting point for the Expenditure Benchmark calculations\u00a0is General Government expenditure as per European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010), which is the aggregate consolidated expenditure of the Central Government sub-sector and the Local Government sub-sector.\u00a0 So Local Authorities expenditure is treated in the same way as the other components of General Government expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure of local government comprises both current and capital expenditure and includes expenditures by all non-market corporations under local government control.

The Government has committed to take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  These are Year 1 Actions in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  Central Bank research on the influences on standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland published last year identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.<\/p>  <p>  I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months since my meetings with the banks.  As recently as last month, two banks made additional reductions to their mortgage offerings.

The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.<\/p>  <p>  While I have no statutory authority or shareholder role to compel any network service provider to provide services in a given area my Department continues to actively monitor the progress of commercial operator plans and will in this context, examine the case which you have raised.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus\u00a0of the\u00a0procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with\u00a0the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlist of\u00a0qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.\u00a0 The third stage of the procurement process involves the\u00a0issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.\u00a0 Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots\u00a0as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal\u00a0contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.\u00a0 A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  Once\u00a0contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed roll-out plan for the network.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. \u00a0In this regard, Minister Humphreys\u00a0will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband task forces,\u00a0working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT03800"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[14157\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on issues (details supplied) regarding a national speed awareness course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 includes an action to \"legislate for, subject to legal advice, and implement rehabilitation and driving awareness courses as court - based sentencing options for repeat offenders\".<\/p>  <p>  The Road Safety Association recently submitted a position paper in relation to this action,\u00a0and the matter is\u00a0now\u00a0under consideration by officials in my Department. \u00a0I would point out, however, that under the Fixed Charge Notice (FCN) system currently in operation, it is not possible to offer such courses in place of FCNs or penalty points without amending legislation. \u00a0As there is no provision to bring this about in the current Road Traffic Bill, this will therefore be a long term project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[14017\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060200059#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"for data he has relating to lands owned or held in County Dublin by Dublin Bus, CIE and Irish Rail.","asker":"1304","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that \u200bI am in the process of getting some information from CIE about this.\u00a0\u00a0As the matter of its property holdings is, in the first instance,\u00a0a matter for CI&Eacute;,\u00a0I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for co-ordination, as needed, with the two subsidiary companies and direct reply.
